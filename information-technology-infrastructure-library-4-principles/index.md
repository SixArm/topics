# Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) 4 Guiding Principles

**Focus on Value:** Everything the organisation does must link back, directly or indirectly, to value for itself, its customers, and other stakeholders. This includes understanding the customer experience and who the service consumer is.

**Start Where You Are:** Avoid starting from scratch without considering what is already available to be leveraged. Assess the current state to identify strengths, weaknesses, and elements that can be reused or improved.

**Progress Iteratively with Feedback:** Do not attempt to do everything at once. Organise work into smaller, manageable sections that can be executed and reviewed quickly. Use feedback before, during, and after each iteration to ensure the effort remains appropriate.

**Collaborate and Promote Visibility:** Work across boundaries to produce results with greater buy-in and relevance. This involves sharing knowledge, building trust, and ensuring stakeholders have access to the information they need.

**Think and Work Holistically:** Recognise that no service or component stands alone. View services as part of a larger ecosystem and consider the interdependencies between people, processes, and technology.

**Keep It Simple and Practical:** Use the minimum number of steps necessary to accomplish an objective. If a process or metric fails to provide value or produce a useful outcome, eliminate it.

**Optimise and Automate:** Maximise the value of work carried out by human and technical resources. Before automating any process, it should be optimised to be as effective as possible; human intervention should only happen where it adds real value.
