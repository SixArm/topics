# Laws and principles

Question: What is the key distinction between a law and a principle in scientific and technical contexts?

- [ ] Laws are theoretical while principles are practical applications
- [ ] Laws describe relationships through quantitative statements (often equations), while principles explain underlying truths or concepts that may not be quantitative
- [ ] Principles are always universal, while laws only apply in specific conditions
- [ ] Laws require experimental proof, while principles are based on consensus among experts

  <p>Laws describe relationships through quantitative statements (often equations), while principles explain underlying truths or concepts that may not be quantitative</p>
  <p>Laws are typically expressed as equations or formulas that describe measurable relationships between variables (e.g., Newton's laws of motion relating force, mass, and acceleration). Principles are more general fundamental truths that explain why things work the way they do and may not involve numerical values—such as the principle of conservation of energy or natural selection. Understanding this distinction helps technology professionals correctly apply and communicate scientific concepts.</p>
