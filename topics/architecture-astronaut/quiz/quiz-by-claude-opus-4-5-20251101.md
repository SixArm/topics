  <p>They overcomplicate projects by focusing excessively on architectural design without real need for such complexity</p>
  <p>An architecture astronaut over-engineers solutions, implements sophisticated patterns when simpler approaches would suffice, and prioritizes theoretical elegance over simplicity and practicality—often losing sight of the project's primary business objectives.</p>
