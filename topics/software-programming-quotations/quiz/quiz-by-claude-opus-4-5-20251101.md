  <p>For people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute</p>
  <p>Harold Abelson's quotation emphasizes that code readability and human comprehension should be the primary goal of programming. While code must ultimately run on machines, prioritizing readability leads to more maintainable, debuggable, and collaborative software development. This principle underpins modern best practices like clean code, meaningful variable names, and clear documentation.</p>
