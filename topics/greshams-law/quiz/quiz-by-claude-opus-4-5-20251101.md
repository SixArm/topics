# Gresham's Law

Question: In software systems, how does Gresham's Law manifest when both high-quality and low-quality solutions coexist in a codebase?

- [ ] High-quality code automatically refactors low-quality code over time
- [ ] Developers tend to propagate quick fixes and workarounds while well-architected patterns remain unused
- [ ] Low-quality code is automatically flagged and removed by linters
- [ ] Market competition ensures only the best code survives

  <p>Gresham's Law states "bad money drives out good" — people spend lower-quality currency while hoarding higher-quality currency. In software development, this manifests when developers copy and propagate quick hacks and workarounds (the "bad money" that's easy to spend) while well-designed patterns and properly architected solutions sit unused or forgotten. Over time, technical debt accumulates as the inferior approaches proliferate, similar to how debased coins drove full-bodied coins out of circulation in 16th century England.</p>
