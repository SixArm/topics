  <p>Initiation, Planning, Execution, Closure</p>
  <p>The PMLC follows a logical progression: first you identify the need and obtain approval (Initiation), then develop detailed plans (Planning), carry out the project activities (Execution), and finally complete deliverables and document lessons learned (Closure). This sequence ensures key activities and deliverables are completed in the proper order while allowing for feedback loops and continuous improvement throughout.</p>
