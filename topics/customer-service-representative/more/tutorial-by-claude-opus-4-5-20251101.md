## Customer Service Representative (CSR)

A Customer Service Representative (CSR) is a company role that involves interacting with customers to address inquiries, provide assistance, and ensure a positive customer experience. CSRs serve as the primary point of contact for customer support and play a critical role in shaping how customers perceive a company's brand and products.

## Why Technology Professionals Should Understand This Role

Technology professionals frequently interact with CSRs in multiple contexts: building tools that CSRs use, designing customer-facing systems, analyzing support data, and sometimes transitioning into customer success roles themselves. Understanding the CSR function helps engineers build better support systems, product managers prioritize features based on customer pain points, and technical leads design more intuitive products that reduce support burden.

## Core Responsibilities

## Communication Channels

| Channel | Best For | Challenges |

## Metrics and Performance Indicators

CSR performance is typically measured across several dimensions:

**Efficiency Metrics**

- Tickets per hour: Volume of cases processed
- Response time: Speed of initial acknowledgment

**Quality Metrics**

- Net Promoter Score (NPS): Likelihood to recommend
- Quality assurance scores: Internal review ratings
- Escalation rate: Percentage of issues requiring supervisor involvement

**Business Impact Metrics**

## Technology Systems Used by CSRs

**Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
Platforms like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Zendesk that centralize customer data, interaction history, and account information. These systems enable CSRs to access context quickly and personalize interactions.

Phone systems (VoIP, call center software), email clients, live chat tools (Intercom, Drift), and social media management platforms (Sprout Social, Hootsuite).

**Analytics and Reporting Tools**
Dashboards and reporting systems that track performance metrics, identify trends, and surface insights for process improvement.
