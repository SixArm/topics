  <p>Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack</p>
  <p>A Man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker secretly positions themselves between two communicating parties, intercepting and potentially modifying data in transit. This is particularly dangerous because both parties believe they are communicating directly with each other. Understanding MITM attacks is critical for technology professionals because they highlight the importance of encryption (TLS/SSL), certificate validation, and secure communication protocols.</p>
