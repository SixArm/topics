# Bridge loan

A bridge loan is a type of short-term financing designed to help an individual or company cover immediate financial obligations while awaiting longer-term funding. In the technology industry, bridge loans play a critical role in startup financing, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate transitions where timing gaps between funding rounds or revenue milestones can threaten operational continuity. Understanding bridge loans is essential for technology professionals involved in fundraising, financial planning, or executive decision-making.

## How bridge loans work

A bridge loan provides temporary capital that "bridges" the gap between a current financial need and a future funding event. The borrower receives funds quickly, often within days, and repays the loan once the anticipated permanent financing closes. The speed of execution is a defining characteristic: bridge loans prioritize fast access to capital over favorable terms.

The typical lifecycle of a bridge loan follows a straightforward pattern. The borrower identifies a short-term funding gap, negotiates terms with a lender, receives the funds, and then repays the loan (plus interest and fees) when the expected financing event occurs. If that event fails to materialize, the borrower faces significant financial risk.

## Common use cases in technology

Bridge loans appear frequently across several scenarios relevant to technology companies:

- **Between venture capital rounds**: A startup running low on cash before closing its next funding round may take a bridge loan to maintain operations, retain employees, and continue product development.
- **Pre-IPO financing**: Companies preparing for an initial public offering may use bridge loans to fund operations during the months-long IPO process.
- **Mergers and acquisitions**: An acquiring company may use bridge financing to complete a deal quickly while arranging longer-term debt or equity financing.
- **Revenue timing gaps**: SaaS companies with large enterprise contracts may face delays between contract signing and first payment, making bridge loans useful for covering operational costs.
- **Real estate for expansion**: Tech companies securing new office space or data center facilities may use bridge loans to close on property while arranging permanent commercial financing.

## Key terms and structure

Bridge loans carry distinct structural characteristics that differentiate them from conventional financing:

| Feature | Typical Bridge Loan | Traditional Term Loan |
|---|---|---|
| Duration | 2 weeks to 12 months | 1 to 10 years |
| Interest rate | 8% to 15% or higher | 3% to 8% |
| Approval speed | Days to 1-2 weeks | Weeks to months |
| Collateral | Often required | Varies |
| Origination fees | 1% to 3% of loan value | 0.5% to 1% |
| Repayment | Lump sum at maturity | Monthly installments |

Additional terms commonly found in bridge loan agreements include:

- **Maturity date**: The date by which the loan must be repaid in full.
- **Conversion clause**: In startup contexts, bridge loans often include the option to convert the outstanding balance into equity during the next funding round, typically at a discount.
- **Warrant coverage**: Lenders may receive warrants granting the right to purchase equity at a set price, compensating for the higher risk.
- **Personal guarantee**: Founders or executives may be required to personally guarantee repayment.

## Bridge loans in startup financing

In the startup ecosystem, bridge loans serve a particularly important function. They are most commonly structured as convertible notes or SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity) that provide immediate capital with the expectation of converting into equity at the next priced round.

A typical startup bridge loan scenario unfolds when a company has six months of runway remaining but expects its Series B round to close in eight months. Rather than making painful cuts, the company raises a bridge round from existing investors or new lenders to cover the gap. The bridge note might carry a 20% discount on the next round's valuation, rewarding the bridge investors for taking on additional risk.

There are important considerations for technology founders evaluating bridge financing:

- **Signal risk**: Taking a bridge loan can signal to the market that a company is struggling to raise its next round, potentially making subsequent fundraising harder.
- **Dilution**: Conversion discounts and warrant coverage mean bridge financing often results in greater dilution than raising a priced round directly.
- **Investor relationships**: Existing investors who participate in bridge rounds demonstrate continued confidence; those who decline may be signaling concern.
- **Cap table complexity**: Multiple bridge instruments with varying terms can create cap table complications that deter future investors.

## Advantages and disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- Provides fast access to capital when timing is critical
- Enables companies to maintain momentum during funding transitions
- Allows borrowers to negotiate permanent financing from a position of operational stability rather than desperation
- Conversion features can align bridge lender and borrower interests
- Preserves optionality by deferring valuation decisions to a later date

**Disadvantages:**

- Higher interest rates and fees increase the total cost of capital
- Short repayment timelines create pressure and financial risk
- Failure to secure follow-on financing can lead to default, forced asset sales, or company failure
- Conversion discounts and warrants dilute existing shareholders
- Over-reliance on bridge financing can mask fundamental business problems
- Personal guarantees expose founders to individual financial liability

## Risk management

Technology professionals should approach bridge loans with disciplined risk assessment. Before pursuing bridge financing, consider the following:

- **Probability of the triggering event**: How confident are you that the next funding round, acquisition, or revenue milestone will close? Bridge loans are appropriate when the future event is highly probable but not yet finalized.
- **Downside scenario planning**: What happens if the anticipated event does not occur? Ensure the company has a contingency plan that does not depend solely on optimistic assumptions.
- **Total cost analysis**: Calculate the all-in cost of the bridge loan including interest, fees, conversion discounts, and warrant coverage. Compare this against alternative options such as cutting expenses, accelerating revenue, or raising a smaller priced round.
- **Legal review**: Bridge loan agreements can contain complex provisions. Engage legal counsel experienced in venture financing to review all terms before signing.

## Summary

A bridge loan is short-term financing that covers the gap between an immediate capital need and a future funding event. For technology professionals, bridge loans most commonly arise in the context of startup fundraising, where they provide operational runway between venture capital rounds. While bridge loans offer speed and flexibility, they carry higher costs, dilution risk, and the fundamental danger that the anticipated follow-on financing may not materialize. Effective use of bridge loans requires honest assessment of future funding probability, thorough cost analysis, strong legal review, and clear contingency planning.
