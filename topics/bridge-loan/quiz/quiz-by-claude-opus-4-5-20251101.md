  <p>To provide temporary short-term financing while waiting for permanent funding</p>
  <p>A bridge loan is specifically designed to "bridge the gap" between two financial transactions, providing temporary financing while a borrower waits for more permanent financing to become available. Common examples include funding a new property purchase before an existing property sells, or providing working capital while awaiting a larger funding round.</p>
