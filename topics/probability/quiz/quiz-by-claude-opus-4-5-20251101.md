Question: What is the fundamental difference between theoretical probability and empirical probability?

- [ ] Theoretical probability applies only to financial markets, while empirical probability applies to scientific experiments
- [ ] Theoretical probability is based on mathematical calculations assuming equally likely outcomes, while empirical probability is derived from observed frequency over many trials
- [ ] Theoretical probability always equals 1, while empirical probability ranges between 0 and 1
- [ ] Theoretical probability requires Bayes' theorem, while empirical probability uses only conditional probability

  <p>Theoretical probability is based on mathematical calculations assuming equally likely outcomes, while empirical probability is derived from observed frequency over many trials</p>
  <p>Theoretical probability calculates likelihood using mathematical formulas under the assumption that all outcomes are equally likely (e.g., a fair coin has 0.5 probability of heads). Empirical probability, also called experimental probability, is determined by conducting experiments or analyzing historical data to observe how frequently an event actually occurs. For technology professionals, understanding this distinction is critical when building predictive models—theoretical probability provides baseline expectations, while empirical probability from real-world data often reveals deviations that inform better system design and risk assessment.</p>
