  <p>Agile can work well with or without Scrum-like ceremonies</p>
  <p>Agile is a set of values and principles, not a rigid framework. While Scrum-like ceremonies such as standups, showcases, sprints, backlogs, and retrospectives are commonly used, they are not mandatory for practicing Agile. Teams can adapt their processes based on their specific context, needs, and what delivers the most value. The flexibility to work with or without these ceremonies demonstrates that Agile is about the underlying mindset rather than strict adherence to specific practices.</p>
