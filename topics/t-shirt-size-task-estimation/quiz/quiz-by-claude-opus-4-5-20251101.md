  <p>To communicate relative effort without specific time estimates</p>
  <p>T-shirt size estimation is a simple and intuitive technique that allows project teams to quickly communicate and understand the relative effort involved in tasks without getting into specific time or resource estimates. This makes it easier to categorize work by complexity while maintaining flexibility, since the sizes are intentionally abstract rather than tied to precise durations.</p>
