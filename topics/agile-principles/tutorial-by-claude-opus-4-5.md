# Agile Principles: Tutorial

## Overview

The Twelve Principles behind the Agile Manifesto provide concrete guidance for putting the four agile values into practice. While the manifesto states what agile teams prioritize, the principles describe how those priorities translate into day-to-day behavior. Together, they form the philosophical foundation for all agile methodologies.

## The Twelve Principles at a Glance

1. Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently, with a preference for shorter timescales
4. Business people and developers must work together daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals and trust them
6. Face-to-face conversation is the most effective communication method
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Promote sustainable development pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence enhances agility
10. Simplicity—maximizing work not done—is essential
11. The best results emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Reflect regularly and adjust behavior accordingly

## Thematic Groups

The twelve principles cluster into several themes:

### Delivering Value (Principles 1, 3, 7)

These principles focus on what teams produce. The emphasis is on working software that provides real value to customers, delivered early and often. Progress is measured by what users can actually use, not by documents produced or tasks completed.

### Embracing Change (Principles 2, 12)

Change is treated as a competitive advantage rather than a risk. Teams welcome evolving requirements and continuously reflect on their own processes to improve.

### People and Collaboration (Principles 4, 5, 6, 11)

People are at the center of agile. These principles advocate for daily collaboration between business and technical team members, trust in motivated individuals, direct communication, and self-organizing teams that determine their own best approaches.

### Technical Excellence (Principles 8, 9, 10)

Sustainable pace, continuous attention to quality, and simplicity ensure that teams can maintain their agility over the long term. Cutting corners creates technical debt that slows teams down; simplicity prevents unnecessary complexity from accumulating.

## Applying the Principles

### As a Team Member

- Use the principles to evaluate your daily practices. Are you delivering working software frequently? Are you communicating face-to-face when possible? Are you keeping things simple?
- Raise concerns in retrospectives when team practices drift away from these principles.
- Resist the urge to over-engineer or build features nobody has asked for.

### As a Team Lead or Scrum Master

- Protect the team's sustainable pace by pushing back on unrealistic deadlines.
- Facilitate daily collaboration between business stakeholders and developers.
- Create an environment of psychological safety where reflection and honest feedback can happen.
- Trust the team to self-organize rather than dictating how work should be done.

### As an Organization

- Align incentives with these principles. If the organization rewards activity over outcomes, or individual performance over team collaboration, the principles will not take hold.
- Invest in hiring motivated individuals rather than trying to motivate people through external incentives alone.
- Ensure that business representatives are available to work with development teams daily, not just at milestone reviews.

## Common Misconceptions

- **"Agile means no planning"**: The principles call for adaptive planning, not no planning. Principles 1, 3, and 7 all require deliberate prioritization and sequencing.
- **"Agile means no documentation"**: Principle 7 says working software is the primary measure of progress, not the only artifact. Documentation that adds value is appropriate.
- **"Self-organizing means no management"**: Principle 11 says the best results emerge from self-organizing teams. Teams still need clear goals, support, and alignment with organizational objectives.
- **"Sustainable pace means working slowly"**: Principle 8 advocates for a consistent, maintainable pace—not a slow one. The goal is steady productivity without burnout.

## Key Takeaway

The twelve principles translate agile values into actionable guidance. They describe a way of working that prioritizes people, collaboration, working software, and adaptability. Use them as a lens for evaluating your team's practices and as a compass for making decisions when trade-offs arise.
