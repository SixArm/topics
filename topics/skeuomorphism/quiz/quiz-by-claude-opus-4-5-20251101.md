  <p>To mimic real-world objects and materials to provide familiarity and intuitive interaction</p>
  <p>Skeuomorphism is a design approach that incorporates visual or interactive elements mimicking real-world objects—such as buttons resembling physical buttons or interfaces resembling books and notepads. The goal is to bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds, providing users with a sense of familiarity that makes interfaces more intuitive to use. While this approach was particularly popular in early GUIs and mobile applications, it has given way to flatter, more minimalist designs in recent years.</p>
