  <p>Effective implementation and the ability to deliver results matter more than having a great plan alone</p>
  <p>The saying emphasizes that while having a great strategy is important, it's not enough on its own. Success requires the ability to execute that strategy effectively—being proactive, nimble, adaptable, and focused on delivering results rather than simply having a good plan. This involves having the right people, processes, and tools, along with effective prioritization, clear communication, and efficient resource management.</p>
