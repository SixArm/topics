# Composition

Question: What type of relationship does composition model between objects in software engineering?

- [ ] An "is-a" relationship where an object inherits from another
- [ ] A "has-a" relationship where an object contains or is composed of other objects
- [ ] A "uses-a" relationship where objects communicate through messages
- [ ] A "knows-a" relationship where objects reference each other loosely

  <p>A "has-a" relationship where an object contains or is composed of other objects</p>
  <p>Composition models a "has-a" relationship, meaning one object contains or is composed of other objects. For example, a "Car" has an "Engine" and "Wheels." This differs from inheritance, which models an "is-a" relationship. Composition offers greater flexibility because components can be replaced or extended without affecting the rest of the system, making it a preferred approach for building modular, maintainable software.</p>
