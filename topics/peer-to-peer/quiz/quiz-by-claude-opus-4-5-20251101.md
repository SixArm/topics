# Peer-to-peer (P2P)

Question: What distinguishes a peer-to-peer (P2P) network architecture from a traditional client-server model?

- [ ] P2P networks require a central server to coordinate all communications between nodes
- [ ] Each node in a P2P network can act as both a client and a server, enabling direct resource sharing
- [ ] P2P networks can only be used for file sharing applications
- [ ] Client-server models are more resilient to failure than P2P networks

  <p>Each node in a P2P network can act as both a client and a server, enabling direct resource sharing</p>
  <p>In a P2P network, participants share resources and computing power directly with each other without needing a centralized server or intermediary. This dual role of each node—functioning as both client and server—is the fundamental characteristic that differentiates P2P from client-server architectures, where clients only request services from a central server. This decentralized approach provides benefits such as greater scalability, more efficient resource use, and resilience to failure since there is no single point of failure.</p>
