  <p>Building trust and fostering open communication</p>
  <p>Trust and open communication are foundational to effective collaboration. When team members feel safe to express their thoughts, take risks, and share ideas openly, the team can work together more effectively. While tools and meetings are helpful enablers, they cannot substitute for a culture of trust and transparency that allows diverse perspectives to be heard and respected.</p>
