# Anomaly detection

Question: What is the key difference between supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection?

- [ ] Supervised methods are faster to execute than unsupervised methods
- [ ] Unsupervised methods can only detect known anomaly types
- [ ] Supervised methods require labeled data where anomalies are marked, while unsupervised methods identify deviations from normal patterns without labels
- [ ] Supervised methods work only with time-series data

  <p>Supervised methods require labeled data where anomalies are marked, while unsupervised methods identify deviations from normal patterns without labels</p>
  <p>Supervised anomaly detection trains a model using data where anomalies are explicitly labeled, allowing it to recognize similar anomalies in new data. Unsupervised anomaly detection does not require labeled data—instead, it identifies patterns that deviate from the norm. This distinction is critical for technology professionals because it determines data requirements, use cases, and implementation approaches. Unsupervised methods are often preferred when labeled anomaly data is scarce or when detecting novel, previously unknown anomalies.</p>
