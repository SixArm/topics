  <p>Strategic partnerships involve deep collaboration toward shared long-term goals, while tactical partnerships focus on specific short-term objectives</p>
  <p>Strategic partnerships are longer-term collaborative alliances that align goals, resources, and capabilities for mutual benefits, featuring deep relationship building and generally higher risk-sharing. Tactical partnerships (also called transactional partnerships) are shorter-term collaborations focused on immediate objectives, with limited resource sharing and no long-term commitment. Organizations may start with tactical partnerships and transition them into strategic partnerships based on mutual success.</p>
