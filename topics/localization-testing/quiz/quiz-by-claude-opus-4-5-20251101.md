  <p>To ensure software can be adapted to different languages, cultures, and regions without losing functionality or usability</p>
  <p>Localization testing verifies that an application works correctly when adapted for different target markets. This includes testing UI/UX handling of different languages and scripts, proper translation of content, correct handling of local formats (dates, currencies, numbers), cultural appropriateness of symbols and imagery, and compliance with local laws and regulations.</p>
