  <p>Subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters</p>
  <p>eNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (employees who rate 0-6) from the percentage of promoters (employees who rate 9-10). This yields a score ranging from -100 to 100, where a positive score indicates more promoters than detractors, and a score above 50 is considered excellent.</p>
