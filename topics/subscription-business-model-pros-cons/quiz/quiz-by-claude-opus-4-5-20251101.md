  <p>Predictable revenue from recurring customer payments</p>
  <p>Because customers pay a recurring fee, subscription businesses have a more predictable revenue stream than businesses that rely on one-time sales. This predictability helps with financial planning, forecasting, and business stability. In contrast, the other options are actually challenges of the subscription model: acquisition costs tend to be high, scalability can be difficult, and churn is a significant concern that subscription businesses must actively manage.</p>
