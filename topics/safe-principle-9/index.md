# Decentralize decision-making

"Decentralize decision-making" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 1.

Achieving fast value delivery requires decentralized decision-making. This
reduces delays, improves product development flow, enables faster feedback, and
creates more innovative solutions designed by those closest to the local
knowledge. However, some decisions are strategic and global and have economies
of scale that justify centralized decision-making. Since both types of decisions
occur, creating a reliable decision-making framework is a critical step in
empowering employees and ensuring a fast flow of value.
