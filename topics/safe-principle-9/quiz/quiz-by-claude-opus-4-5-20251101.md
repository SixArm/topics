  <p>To achieve fast value delivery by reducing delays and enabling faster feedback</p>
  <p>Decentralizing decision-making reduces delays, improves product development flow, enables faster feedback, and creates more innovative solutions designed by those closest to the local knowledge. SAFe recognizes that while decentralization accelerates value delivery, some strategic and global decisions with economies of scale still justify centralized decision-making, requiring a balanced framework.</p>
