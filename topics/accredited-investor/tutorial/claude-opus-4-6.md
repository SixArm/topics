# Accredited investor

An accredited investor is an individual or entity that meets specific financial thresholds — related to income, net worth, asset size, governance status, or professional experience — as defined by the securities laws of a particular jurisdiction. In practice, accredited investor status acts as a gatekeeping mechanism: it determines who may participate in certain high-risk, high-reward investment opportunities that are not registered with or fully regulated by public securities authorities. For technology professionals, understanding accredited investor criteria matters because startup equity, venture capital funds, and private placement rounds are typically restricted to accredited investors.

## Why accredited investor status exists

Securities regulators, most notably the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), created the accredited investor framework to balance two competing goals: enabling capital formation for private companies and protecting less-sophisticated investors from outsized financial risk. Unregistered securities — such as shares in a pre-IPO startup — do not carry the same disclosure requirements as publicly traded stocks. The regulatory assumption is that accredited investors possess sufficient financial sophistication, or sufficient wealth to absorb losses, to participate in these offerings without the full protections afforded by public registration.

## Qualification criteria in the United States

The SEC defines accredited investor status under Rule 501 of Regulation D. Individuals and entities qualify through different pathways.

### Individual qualification

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Income test** | Earned income exceeding $200,000 individually (or $300,000 jointly with a spouse or spousal equivalent) in each of the prior two years, with a reasonable expectation of reaching the same level in the current year. |
| **Net worth test** | Net worth exceeding $1 million, individually or jointly with a spouse, excluding the value of a primary residence. |
| **Professional credentials** | Holders of certain FINRA licenses (Series 7, Series 65, or Series 82) qualify regardless of income or net worth. |
| **Knowledgeable employees** | Employees of a private fund who are "knowledgeable" about the fund's investments may qualify with respect to that fund. |

### Entity qualification

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Asset threshold** | Corporations, partnerships, LLCs, or trusts with total assets exceeding $5 million, not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the offered securities. |
| **All-accredited composition** | Any entity in which all equity owners are individually accredited investors. |
| **Registered entities** | Banks, insurance companies, registered investment companies, business development companies, and certain employee benefit plans. |
| **Family offices** | Family offices with at least $5 million in assets under management and their family clients, as directed by a person with sufficient investment knowledge. |

## How verification works

Issuers of unregistered securities must take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers are accredited. Common verification methods include:

- **Income verification**: Reviewing tax returns (W-2 forms, 1099s, K-1s) or obtaining written confirmation from a CPA, attorney, or registered investment advisor.
- **Net worth verification**: Reviewing bank and brokerage statements, obtaining a credit report to assess liabilities, and collecting a written representation that the primary residence value has been excluded.
- **Third-party verification services**: Platforms such as VerifyInvestor and Parallel Markets provide standardized accreditation checks, commonly used by online fundraising platforms.
- **Self-certification**: In certain offering types (e.g., Rule 506(b) offerings), the issuer may rely on a reasonable belief based on the investor's self-representation, without independent verification.

## Relevance for technology professionals

Technology professionals encounter accredited investor requirements in several common scenarios:

- **Angel investing**: Participating in seed or pre-seed rounds for startups typically requires accredited status because these offerings are conducted as private placements under Regulation D.
- **Venture capital fund participation**: Limited partner positions in VC funds are almost universally restricted to accredited (or qualified) investors.
- **Equity crowdfunding platforms**: Platforms such as AngelList, Republic, and Wefunder offer different tiers of access depending on accreditation status. Accredited investors may invest larger amounts and access a broader set of deals.
- **Secondary market transactions**: Purchasing pre-IPO shares on secondary markets (e.g., Forge, EquityZen) generally requires accredited investor verification.
- **Startup employee considerations**: If you hold equity in a private technology company, understanding accredited investor rules helps you navigate secondary sales, tender offers, and potential reinvestment of proceeds.

## Accredited investor versus qualified purchaser

Accredited investor status is often confused with qualified purchaser status, which carries higher thresholds and grants access to a different class of investment vehicles.

| Attribute | Accredited investor | Qualified purchaser |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Individual threshold** | $200K income or $1M net worth | $5M+ in investments |
| **Entity threshold** | $5M in assets | $25M+ in investments |
| **Governing regulation** | SEC Regulation D | Investment Company Act of 1940 |
| **Typical access** | Private placements, Reg D offerings, hedge funds (3(c)(1)) | Funds exempt under Section 3(c)(7), larger hedge funds, institutional-grade vehicles |
| **Verification rigor** | Moderate | Higher |

## Limitations and criticisms

- **Wealth as a proxy for sophistication**: Critics argue that income and net worth are imprecise proxies for financial knowledge. A highly compensated software engineer may have no investment experience, while a financially literate individual earning less may be excluded.
- **Inflation erosion**: The $200,000 income and $1 million net worth thresholds were established in 1982 and have never been adjusted for inflation. In inflation-adjusted terms, the original thresholds would be significantly higher today, meaning a much larger share of the population now qualifies.
- **Access inequality**: The framework restricts access to potentially high-return investments to those who are already wealthy, reinforcing existing wealth concentration.
- **2020 amendments**: The SEC partially addressed these concerns in 2020 by adding professional credential pathways (FINRA licenses) and expanding entity definitions, but the core financial thresholds remain unchanged.

## Summary

An accredited investor is an individual or entity that meets SEC-defined financial thresholds — primarily $200,000 in annual income or $1 million in net worth for individuals — granting access to unregistered securities offerings such as startup equity rounds, venture capital funds, and hedge funds. The framework exists to protect less-wealthy investors from high-risk private investments, though it is increasingly criticized for using static wealth thresholds as a proxy for financial sophistication. For technology professionals, accredited investor status is the primary gateway to angel investing, VC fund participation, and secondary market transactions in pre-IPO company shares, making it a practical concept to understand as both a potential investor and a startup equity holder.
