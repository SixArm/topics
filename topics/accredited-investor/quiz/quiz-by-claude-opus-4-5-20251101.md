  <p>Earning income exceeding $200,000 annually (or $300,000 with spouse) for the past two years, or having net worth over $1 million excluding primary residence</p>
  <p>In the United States, accredited investor status is based on specific financial thresholds: either high income ($200,000 individual or $300,000 with spouse for the past two years with expectation of the same) or high net worth (over $1 million excluding primary residence). This status grants access to investment opportunities like private equity, hedge funds, and venture capital that are not available to the general public, based on the assumption that qualified investors can better understand and absorb the higher risks involved.</p>
