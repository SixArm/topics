  <p>A team small enough to be fed with two pizzas, typically 6-10 people</p>
  <p>The pizza team concept, coined by Jeff Bezos at Amazon, refers to keeping teams small enough that two pizzas could feed the entire group. This size constraint promotes better communication, collaboration, and faster decision-making by eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy. The small team size ensures everyone knows what others are working on and helps maintain camaraderie while working toward common goals.</p>
