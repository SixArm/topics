# Definition of Ready (DoR)

"Definition of Ready" establishes clear criteria for when a user story, feature, or work item is sufficiently prepared to enter a development sprint. This shared understanding between product owners, developers, and stakeholders ensures that teams can begin work immediately without delays caused by unclear requirements or missing information.

The Definition of Ready serves as a quality gate that prevents poorly defined work from entering the development cycle. Common criteria include having well-written acceptance criteria, clear business value statements, appropriate story sizing or effort estimates, and necessary design mockups or technical specifications. Dependencies should be identified and resolved, and any required research or spike work should be completed beforehand.

Teams typically customize their Definition of Ready based on their specific context, technology stack, and organizational requirements. Some teams might require security considerations to be addressed, while others might need database schema changes approved before work begins. The key is ensuring all team members agree on what constitutes "ready" work.

However, teams must balance thoroughness with agility. An overly rigid Definition of Ready can slow down delivery and contradict agile principles of responding to change. The criteria should be regularly reviewed and adjusted based on team learning and evolving project needs, ensuring it remains a helpful tool rather than a bureaucratic obstacle.
