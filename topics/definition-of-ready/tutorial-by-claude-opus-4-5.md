## Definition of Ready (DoR)

The Definition of Ready (DoR) is a checklist of criteria that a user story, feature, or backlog item must satisfy before a development team commits to working on it during a sprint. It functions as a quality gate between product planning and active development, ensuring teams can begin work immediately without being blocked by ambiguities, missing information, or unresolved dependencies.

## Why Definition of Ready Matters

Without a clear DoR, teams frequently encounter mid-sprint disruptions: unclear requirements lead to rework, missing designs cause developers to wait, and unidentified dependencies create bottlenecks. These interruptions erode sprint predictability and team morale.

A well-crafted DoR delivers several benefits:

- **Reduced waste** — Teams avoid starting work they cannot finish due to missing information
- **Improved predictability** — Sprint commitments become more reliable when work items are fully prepared
- **Clearer communication** — Product owners and stakeholders understand what the team needs to begin work
- **Higher quality** — Well-defined acceptance criteria lead to better implementations and fewer defects
- **Team empowerment** — Developers can push back on vague requirements without appearing obstructive

## Common DoR Criteria

Most teams include a combination of the following elements in their Definition of Ready:

| Criterion | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Acceptance criteria defined | Specifies what "done" looks like for this item |
| Business value articulated | Explains why this work matters |
| Story sized appropriately | Small enough to complete within a single sprint |
| Dependencies identified | External blockers are known and addressed |
| Design artifacts available | Mockups, wireframes, or prototypes are ready |
| Technical approach agreed | Architecture decisions are made |
| Testability confirmed | QA understands how to verify the work |
| Stakeholder approval obtained | Product owner has prioritized and approved |

## Definition of Ready vs. Definition of Done

These two concepts serve complementary but distinct purposes:

| Aspect | Definition of Ready | Definition of Done |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Timing | Before work begins | After work completes |
| Focus | Input quality | Output quality |
| Owner | Product owner + team | Development team |
| Purpose | Can we start? | Is it finished? |
| Gate | Entry to sprint | Exit from sprint |

Both definitions work together to bookend the development process, ensuring quality at both ends.

## Building an Effective DoR

When establishing your Definition of Ready, consider these principles:

- **Involve the whole team** — Developers, testers, designers, and product owners should all contribute criteria
- **Start minimal** — Begin with essential criteria and expand based on experience
- **Keep it visible** — Post the DoR where everyone can reference it during refinement
- **Review regularly** — Retrospectives should assess whether the DoR helps or hinders
- **Avoid rigidity** — Allow exceptions when the team collectively agrees

## Warning Signs of DoR Problems

An overly strict DoR can become counterproductive. Watch for these symptoms:

- Stories sit in backlog refinement for multiple sprints
- Product owners feel frustrated by constant rejection of their items
- The team spends more time refining than building
- Innovation slows because experimental work rarely meets criteria
- The DoR becomes a shield against accepting any work

Conversely, an insufficient DoR shows different symptoms:

- Frequent mid-sprint scope changes
- Developers regularly blocked waiting for answers
- Stories carry over to multiple sprints
- Acceptance criteria written after development begins
- High defect rates from misunderstood requirements

## Sample Definition of Ready Checklist

A practical DoR might include:

- User story follows the "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]" format
- Acceptance criteria are written and understood by the team
- Story is estimated and fits within a single sprint
- UI/UX designs are approved and accessible
- Technical dependencies are resolved or have a clear path to resolution
- Security and compliance requirements are identified
- The product owner is available to answer questions during the sprint
- The story has been discussed in backlog refinement

## Integrating DoR Into Your Process

The Definition of Ready becomes most effective when embedded into regular ceremonies:

**Backlog refinement sessions** — Review upcoming items against DoR criteria. Items that fail should be returned for further preparation or have action items assigned.

**Sprint planning** — Only pull items that meet the DoR into the sprint. This protects the team from overcommitment to unprepared work.

**Retrospectives** — Periodically assess whether the DoR is serving its purpose. Adjust criteria based on what the team has learned.

## Balancing Readiness With Agility

The Definition of Ready exists to serve the team, not the other way around. Agile principles emphasize responding to change over following a plan. An effective DoR should:

- Enable rapid iteration rather than demand perfect specifications
- Support learning through development rather than preventing all uncertainty
- Encourage conversation rather than extensive documentation
- Adapt to project phase (early-stage products may need looser criteria)

Teams should treat the DoR as a living agreement that evolves with their needs. When an item almost meets the DoR and the team is confident they can proceed, rigid enforcement serves no one. The goal is informed commitment, not bureaucratic compliance.
