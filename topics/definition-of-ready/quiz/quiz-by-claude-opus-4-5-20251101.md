  <p>To establish criteria for when a work item is sufficiently prepared to enter a sprint</p>
  <p>The Definition of Ready serves as a quality gate that ensures user stories, features, or work items have clear acceptance criteria, business value statements, appropriate sizing, and resolved dependencies before entering the development cycle. This shared understanding between product owners, developers, and stakeholders prevents delays caused by unclear requirements or missing information.</p>
