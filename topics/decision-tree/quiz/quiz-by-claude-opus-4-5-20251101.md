# Decision tree

Question: What is the primary structural difference between a classification tree and a regression tree?

- [ ] Classification trees can only have two branches per node, while regression trees can have multiple branches
- [ ] Classification trees predict continuous values, while regression trees categorize data into classes
- [ ] Classification trees categorize data into distinct classes, while regression trees predict continuous values
- [ ] Classification trees are used only in medicine, while regression trees are used only in finance

  <p>Classification trees categorize data into distinct classes, while regression trees predict continuous values</p>
  <p>Classification trees are designed to classify data into different categories or classes (e.g., "spam" or "not spam"), while regression trees predict a continuous numerical value (e.g., a price, temperature, or probability). This distinction determines which type of decision tree to use based on whether your target variable is categorical or continuous.</p>
