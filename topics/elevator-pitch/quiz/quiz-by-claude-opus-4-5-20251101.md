  <p>To make a strong impression and generate interest in your idea or proposal</p>
  <p>An elevator pitch is designed to be a short (30 seconds to two minutes), persuasive speech that quickly communicates an idea or business proposal. The goal is not to close a deal or provide exhaustive details, but rather to capture attention, create interest, and open the door for further conversation. It should be concise, compelling, and tailored to your audience, clearly explaining what your idea does, who it serves, and why it is valuable.</p>
