# Fuzz testing

Fuzz testing, also known as fuzzing, is an automated software testing technique that involves feeding invalid, unexpected, or random data inputs to a program to discover vulnerabilities, crashes, and security flaws. This method systematically bombards applications with malformed data to identify edge cases that developers might not have anticipated during normal testing procedures.

Fuzzing tools monitor the target application's behavior, looking for crashes, memory leaks, assertion failures, or other abnormal responses that could indicate potential security vulnerabilities or bugs. Modern fuzzers often employ coverage-guided techniques, using feedback from program execution to generate more effective test cases that explore previously untested code paths.

There are several types of fuzzing approaches, including black-box fuzzing, which tests applications without knowledge of internal structure, and white-box fuzzing, which leverages source code analysis to guide input generation. Grammar-based fuzzing uses structured input formats, while mutation-based fuzzing modifies existing valid inputs to create test cases.

Fuzz testing has proven particularly valuable in cybersecurity, helping identify buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities, and other critical security flaws before software reaches production.

The technique's effectiveness lies in its ability to test scenarios that human testers might never consider, making it an essential complement to traditional testing methods. However, fuzzing requires significant computational resources and may produce false positives that need manual verification.
