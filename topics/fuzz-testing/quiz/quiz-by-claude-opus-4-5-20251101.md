# Fuzz testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of fuzz testing in software development?

- [ ] To verify that user documentation matches the application's actual behavior
- [ ] To measure application performance under expected production load conditions
- [ ] To discover vulnerabilities and crashes by feeding invalid, unexpected, or random data inputs to a program
- [ ] To ensure code formatting follows organizational style guidelines

  <p>To discover vulnerabilities and crashes by feeding invalid, unexpected, or random data inputs to a program</p>
  <p>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is an automated testing technique that systematically bombards applications with malformed, invalid, or random data to identify edge cases, security vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, crashes, and memory leaks that developers might not anticipate during normal testing. This makes it particularly valuable for cybersecurity and finding critical flaws before software reaches production.</p>
