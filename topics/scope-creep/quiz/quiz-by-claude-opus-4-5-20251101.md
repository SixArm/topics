  <p>It causes delays, budget overruns, quality slippage, and team frustration</p>
  <p>Scope creep is the uncontrolled expansion of a project's scope beyond its initial objectives. When new features or changes are added without proper evaluation of their impact on timeline, resources, and budget, the project suffers from delays, cost overruns, reduced quality, and decreased team morale. Effective management requires change control processes and stakeholder education about tradeoffs.</p>
