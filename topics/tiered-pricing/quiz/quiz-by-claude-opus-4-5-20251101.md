  <p>It allows companies to serve customers with varying needs and budgets while maximizing revenue from those willing to pay more for additional features</p>
  <p>Tiered pricing is effective because it provides options for customers with different needs, preferences, and budgets, while also capturing more revenue from customers who value and are willing to pay for additional features or benefits. This dual benefit of customer acquisition/retention and revenue optimization is the core value proposition of the tiered pricing model.</p>
