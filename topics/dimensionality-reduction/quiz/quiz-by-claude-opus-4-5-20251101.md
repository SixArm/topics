# Dimensionality reduction

Question: What are the two main types of dimensionality reduction techniques?

- [ ] Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- [ ] Supervised learning and unsupervised learning
- [ ] Feature selection and feature extraction
- [ ] Clustering and classification

  <p>Feature selection and feature extraction</p>
  <p>Dimensionality reduction techniques fall into two main categories: feature selection (choosing a subset of original features to retain) and feature extraction (creating new features from original ones using transformations). PCA and t-SNE are specific examples of feature extraction methods, not the main categories themselves.</p>
