# Selenium browser automation

Selenium is a popular open-source framework for automating web browsers. It enables you to programmatically control a browser to perform actions like a human—clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating pages.

Common Use Cases

- Automated Testing: Performing functional, regression, and smoke testing on web applications.
- Web Scraping: Extracting data from modern websites that require interaction (e.g., clicking "Load More" or logging in).
- Task Automation: Automating repetitive administrative tasks like daily logins, file uploads, or social media management.

Key Capabilities

- Cross-Browser Support: Automate tasks on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer.
- Multi-Language Bindings: Write scripts in Python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Rust, C#, PHP, or Perl.
- Dynamic Content Handling: Unlike basic scrapers, Selenium can interact with JavaScript-heavy sites, handle AJAX calls, and wait for elements to load asynchronously.
- Headless Mode: Run browsers without a visible user interface to increase execution speed and reduce resource consumption during CI/CD processes.

Core Components

- Selenium WebDriver: The primary tool for creating robust, browser-based automation suites. It uses language-specific bindings (Python, Java, C#, etc.) to communicate directly with browsers.
- Selenium IDE: A browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge used for quick "record-and-playback" of interactions. It is ideal for rapid prototyping and bug reproduction.
- Selenium Grid: A tool for scaling automation by running tests in parallel across multiple machines, browsers, and operating systems.
