  <p>An emotional alliance between two people committed to each other's success</p>
  <p>Warren Buffett's quotation emphasizes that partnership transcends legal agreements. He states: "Partnership is not a legal contract between two equal individuals. It's an emotional alliance between two people who are committed to each other's success."
