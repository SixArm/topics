  <p>Fixed costs are spread across a larger number of units produced</p>
  <p>Economies of scale occur primarily because fixed costs—such as rent, equipment, and management salaries—remain relatively constant regardless of production volume. As a company produces more units, these fixed costs are distributed across a greater number of products, resulting in a lower cost per unit. This cost efficiency enables companies to offer competitive pricing while maintaining profit margins.</p>
