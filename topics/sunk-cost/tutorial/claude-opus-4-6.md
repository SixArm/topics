# Sunk cost

A sunk cost is any expenditure of money, time, effort, or other resources that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered, regardless of what decisions are made going forward. In technology and business, sunk costs arise constantly: the months spent building a feature no one uses, the licensing fees paid for a platform you are migrating away from, or the training investment in a tool your team has outgrown. The critical insight is that rational decision-making should be forward-looking. What you have already spent is gone; the only question that matters is what the best path forward looks like from this point on.

## Why Sunk Costs Matter in Technology

Technology professionals face sunk cost pressures more frequently than most. Software projects involve long development cycles, large upfront investments, and deep emotional attachment to code and architecture. When a team has spent six months building a microservice, it is psychologically difficult to acknowledge that a third-party solution would serve the business better. When an organization has invested millions in an on-premises data center, the idea of moving to cloud infrastructure can feel like admitting the original investment was wasted. Understanding sunk costs is essential to making clear-headed decisions about when to continue, pivot, or abandon a course of action.

## How Sunk Costs Differ from Other Costs

| Cost Type | Definition | Recoverable | Relevant to Future Decisions |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sunk cost | Already incurred and cannot be recovered | No | No |
| Fixed cost | Ongoing cost that does not change with output volume | Potentially | Yes |
| Variable cost | Changes in proportion to activity or output | Potentially | Yes |
| Opportunity cost | Value of the next-best alternative foregone | Not applicable | Yes |

The key distinction is recoverability and relevance. Sunk costs are irreversible. Fixed and variable costs are forward-looking and should factor into planning. Opportunity costs represent what you sacrifice by choosing one path, and they are always relevant to good decision-making.

## The Sunk Cost Fallacy

The sunk cost fallacy is the tendency to continue investing in a decision, project, or course of action because of what has already been spent, rather than because of what is expected going forward. It is one of the most common cognitive biases in both personal and professional life.

In technology organizations, the sunk cost fallacy manifests in several recognizable patterns:

- **Refusing to kill a failing project** because the team has already spent two quarters on it, even when market feedback is clearly negative.
- **Continuing to maintain legacy systems** solely because of the original build cost, even when maintenance expenses now exceed the cost of replacement.
- **Sticking with a technology stack** that no longer fits the organization's needs because of the effort already invested in learning and tooling.
- **Escalating commitment to a vendor** whose product underperforms, because switching would mean "losing" the sunk licensing and integration costs.

The fallacy is driven by loss aversion: people feel losses more intensely than equivalent gains. Abandoning a project feels like crystallizing a loss, while continuing feels like preserving the possibility that the investment will eventually pay off.

## Real-World Examples

| Scenario | Sunk Cost | Rational Response |
|---|---|---|
| A feature built over three months receives no user adoption | Development time and salary costs | Evaluate whether iteration can drive adoption; if not, deprecate the feature and reallocate the team |
| An enterprise license was purchased for a tool the team dislikes | License fee already paid | Assess whether the tool genuinely impedes productivity; if so, switch tools regardless of the license cost |
| A data migration is halfway complete but a better target platform has emerged | Migration effort to date | Compare total future cost of completing the current migration versus restarting on the better platform |
| A startup has spent its seed funding building a product with no traction | Seed capital already spent | Pivot to a new value proposition or wind down; do not raise more capital just to justify the original spend |

## How to Overcome Sunk Cost Bias

Overcoming the sunk cost fallacy requires deliberate practices embedded into organizational culture and individual decision-making habits.

- **Use pre-commitment criteria.** Before starting a project, define measurable conditions under which the project will be continued, pivoted, or killed. When those checkpoints arrive, honor them.
- **Apply zero-based thinking.** Ask: "Knowing what I know now, would I start this project today?" If the answer is no, that is a strong signal to stop.
- **Separate the decision-maker from the investor.** The person who approved the original investment has a psychological incentive to see it succeed. Bring in independent reviewers for go/no-go decisions.
- **Reframe abandonment as reallocation.** Stopping a failing project is not a loss; it is freeing up resources for higher-value work. Focus on what the team gains, not what it gives up.
- **Conduct regular portfolio reviews.** Periodically evaluate all active projects and investments against current priorities. Kill or deprioritize anything that no longer earns its place.
- **Normalize failure.** In organizations where failure is punished, people cling to sunk costs to avoid blame. Creating a culture where learning from failure is valued reduces the emotional pressure to continue bad investments.

## Sunk Costs and Agile Development

Agile methodologies naturally reduce the damage caused by sunk costs. By working in short iterations, delivering incrementally, and gathering continuous feedback, agile teams limit the amount of investment committed before validating whether a direction is working. Sprint reviews and retrospectives create built-in checkpoints where teams can reassess priorities without the psychological weight of large sunk investments. The agile principle of "responding to change over following a plan" is, in essence, a structural antidote to the sunk cost fallacy.

## Summary

A sunk cost is any past expenditure that cannot be recovered. The most important lesson for technology professionals is that sunk costs should never drive future decisions. What matters is the expected value of the paths available from this point forward, not the resources already consumed. The sunk cost fallacy, the tendency to throw good money after bad, is one of the most destructive cognitive biases in technology organizations, leading to wasted effort, delayed pivots, and misallocated resources. By establishing clear decision criteria in advance, practicing zero-based thinking, normalizing failure, and leveraging agile practices that limit upfront commitment, teams and leaders can make sharper, more rational decisions about where to invest their finite time and resources.
