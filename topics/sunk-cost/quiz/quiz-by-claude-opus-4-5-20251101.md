# Sunk cost

  <p>Ignore sunk costs and evaluate decisions based on future costs and benefits</p>
  <p>Sunk costs are expenses that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Rational decision-making should focus on prospective costs and benefits of future actions, not past investments. Continuing a project solely because of prior investment is the "sunk cost fallacy" and leads to poor decisions. Instead, evaluate the potential benefits and opportunity costs of moving forward versus alternative courses of action.</p>
