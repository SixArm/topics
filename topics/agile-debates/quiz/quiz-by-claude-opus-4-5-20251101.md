# Agile debates

Question: What is a core tension in the agile community regarding scaling practices?

- [ ] Agile cannot be applied to any project with more than ten developers
- [ ] Scaling frameworks like SAFe and LeSS may introduce bureaucracy that contradicts agile's original emphasis on small, self-organizing teams
- [ ] All agile teams must use the same scaling framework to be effective
- [ ] Scaling is unnecessary because agile principles automatically work at any organizational size

  <p>Scaling frameworks like SAFe and LeSS may introduce bureaucracy that contradicts agile's original emphasis on small, self-organizing teams</p>
  <p>While agile originally emphasized small, self-organizing teams, organizations struggle with applying these concepts across large, complex projects. Frameworks like SAFe and LeSS attempt to address this challenge, but critics argue they introduce the very bureaucracy agile sought to eliminate. This represents one of the most persistent and fundamental debates in the agile community.</p>
