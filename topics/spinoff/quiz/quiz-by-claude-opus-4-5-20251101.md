  <p>To unlock the value of assets that may not be fully recognized when part of a larger entity</p>
  <p>A spinoff creates a new, independent company from a parent company's assets or operations. The primary purpose is to help unlock value that investors may not fully appreciate when those assets are bundled within a larger organization. This allows the parent company to focus on its core business while the spinoff pursues its own strategic objectives with dedicated resources and management attention.</p>
