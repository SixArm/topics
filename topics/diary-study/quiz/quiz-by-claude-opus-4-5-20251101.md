  <p>To collect qualitative data about experiences and behaviors over time within participants' own context</p>
  <p>A diary study is a research method designed to gather qualitative data about individuals' experiences, behaviors, and thoughts over a specific period. Unlike lab-based usability testing or quantitative analytics, diary studies capture information as participants go about their daily lives, making them particularly valuable for understanding phenomena that unfold over time and exploring thoughts and experiences in natural contexts.</p>
