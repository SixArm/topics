  <p>Problems to solve</p>
  <p>The Agile teams checklist emphasizes that teams should have problems to solve rather than lists of tasks to perform. This reflects a core agile principle: empowering teams to figure out how best to achieve outcomes rather than prescribing specific tasks. When teams focus on solving problems, they can apply their expertise, creativity, and collaboration to find the best solutions, rather than mechanically executing predefined work items.</p>
