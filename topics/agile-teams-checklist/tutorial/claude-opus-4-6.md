# Agile teams checklist

The agile teams checklist is a structured evaluation tool, originally popularized by Mountain Goat Software, that helps organizations assess how well their teams embody agile principles in day-to-day practice. Rather than treating agile as a set of ceremonies to follow, this checklist focuses on the behaviors, mindsets, and organizational conditions that distinguish genuinely agile teams from those that are agile in name only. Technology professionals can use this checklist during retrospectives, coaching sessions, maturity assessments, and organizational transformations to identify strengths and surface areas for improvement.

## Why a Checklist Matters

Agile transformations frequently stall not because teams lack the right tools or frameworks, but because underlying behaviors and cultural norms remain unchanged. A checklist provides a concrete, observable set of criteria that can be discussed openly. It shifts the conversation from abstract values ("we believe in collaboration") to verifiable behaviors ("teams collaborate to finish items rather than optimizing individual output"). For engineering managers, scrum masters, and agile coaches, the checklist serves as both a diagnostic instrument and a conversation starter.

## Team Behaviors

The core of the checklist addresses what high-performing agile teams actually do. These behaviors span autonomy, ownership, quality, and continuous improvement.

| Behavior | What It Looks Like in Practice |
|---|---|
| Teams solve problems, not task lists | Teams receive goals and outcomes, then determine the approach themselves |
| Teams make decisions without managerial approval | Day-to-day technical and process decisions happen within the team |
| Teams adopt and improve practices over time | Retrospectives lead to real changes, not just discussion |
| Teams coordinate proactively across product lines | Cross-team dependencies are surfaced early, not discovered at integration |
| Teams share ideas and experiences openly | Knowledge flows between teams through demos, guilds, or informal channels |
| Teams act quickly on stakeholder feedback | Feedback loops are short; changes appear in the next iteration |
| Teams are rarely blocked by other teams | Work is structured to minimize handoffs and waiting |
| Teams make every effort to complete planned work | Commitments are taken seriously and scope is managed honestly |
| Teams monitor and manage their own performance | The team owns its metrics, velocity, and quality indicators |
| Teams welcome changing requirements | Changing scope is treated as new information, not as disruption |
| Teams admit challenges and mistakes | Problems are raised early without fear of punishment |
| Teams work outside their specialties | Members are willing to stretch beyond their primary skill set |
| Teams seek new skills and deepen existing ones | Learning is continuous, not limited to onboarding |
| Teams feel safe expressing dissenting views | Psychological safety is present and actively maintained |
| Teams start work even with open questions | Progress is not blocked by the pursuit of perfect information |
| Teams understand the purpose behind their work | Motivation comes from mission clarity, not just task assignment |
| Teams take pride in their craft | Quality is intrinsic, not imposed by external review gates |

## Stakeholder Behaviors

Agile does not succeed in a vacuum. The checklist recognizes that stakeholders, including product owners, executives, and business partners, must also demonstrate agile-compatible behaviors.

- **Priority transparency.** Stakeholders know and can articulate which factors determine priorities and deadlines, rather than relying on hidden or shifting criteria.
- **Acceptance of ranges.** Plans are expressed with ranges of estimates rather than false precision. Stakeholders accept this as a sign of honesty, not incompetence.
- **Embrace of change.** Both stakeholders and teams accept that plans may need to change as new information emerges.
- **Frequent evaluation.** Stakeholders have regular opportunities to see, use, and evaluate the product, not just at milestone reviews.
- **Championing agile values.** Stakeholders actively support agile principles rather than paying lip service while reverting to command-and-control habits.
- **Respect for quality.** Quality is treated as a right the team has, not a luxury that gets traded away under deadline pressure.
- **Delegation of authority.** Stakeholders delegate decision-making to teams and do not reclaim it at the first sign of trouble.
- **Support for experimentation.** Unsuccessful experiments are treated as learning opportunities, not grounds for punishment.
- **Clear vision communication.** Stakeholders communicate what they hope to achieve by becoming more agile, giving teams context for their work.
- **People development.** Stakeholders focus on developing people rather than merely managing their performance through metrics.

## Organizational and Cultural Conditions

Beyond individual team and stakeholder behaviors, the checklist identifies organizational conditions that must be in place for agile to take root.

- **Fast decision-making.** Decisions are made quickly, sometimes with incomplete knowledge, because the cost of delay often exceeds the cost of imperfection.
- **Data-driven planning.** Plans are based on data and experience rather than wishful thinking or political pressure.
- **Proactive dependency management.** Dependencies between teams are identified and addressed before they become blockers.
- **Empowered change agents.** An educated executive sponsor ensures the person driving the transformation has the authority to make decisions.
- **Assumption of good intent.** When something goes wrong, people are assumed to have acted with good intentions. Blame is replaced by problem-solving.
- **Reciprocal trust.** Trust flows in both directions, between team members and between teams and stakeholders.
- **Conversation over documentation.** Formal documentation exists where needed but is supplemented by direct conversation wherever possible.
- **Living plans.** As more is learned, plans are updated rather than defended on the basis of outdated information.
- **Non-punitive experimentation.** A safe-to-fail culture encourages teams to try new tools, technologies, and ways of working.
- **Commitment honoring.** People keep promises and honor commitments, building the trust that agile depends on.
- **Partner awareness.** Outside groups that interact with the team understand how agile ways of working may affect their processes.
- **Finished work over work-in-progress.** The organization values completed, delivered work more than the number of items currently in progress.
- **Good enough over perfect.** Early release of a solid product is generally favored over late release of a theoretically perfect one.
- **Quality protection.** Quality is rarely, if ever, sacrificed to meet a deadline.
- **Solution focus over blame.** When inter-team problems arise, the response centers on resolution, not fault-finding.
- **Agile expansion.** Agile practices spread beyond the initial pilot group into the broader organization.
- **Single-team assignment.** Most people are assigned to only one team, reducing context switching and divided loyalties.

## Using the Checklist Effectively

The checklist is most valuable when used as a living assessment rather than a one-time audit. Consider the following approaches:

- **Retrospective integration.** Select a handful of checklist items each sprint and have the team self-assess against them. Rotate through the full checklist over several months.
- **Maturity baselining.** Score each item on a simple scale (not yet, partially, fully) at the start of a transformation to establish a baseline. Reassess quarterly.
- **Coaching conversations.** Agile coaches can use specific checklist items as prompts for deeper discussion about what is working and what is not.
- **Cross-team calibration.** When multiple teams use the same checklist, the organization gains visibility into systemic issues versus team-specific challenges.
- **Stakeholder alignment.** Share the stakeholder section with executives and product owners. Many agile failures stem from team-level adoption without corresponding leadership changes.

## Common Anti-Patterns

When organizations score poorly on particular checklist items, recurring anti-patterns often emerge.

| Anti-Pattern | Checklist Item It Violates |
|---|---|
| Micromanagement of task execution | Teams decide how to execute work |
| Blaming individuals when experiments fail | Non-punitive attitude toward experimentation |
| Refusing to adjust plans despite new data | Plans are updated as more is learned |
| Hoarding knowledge within a single team | Teams openly share ideas and experiences |
| Assigning people to three or four teams simultaneously | Most people are assigned to only one team |
| Treating quality as negotiable under deadline pressure | Quality is rarely sacrificed to meet a deadline |
| Requiring complete information before starting | Teams start work even with open questions |

## Summary

The agile teams checklist provides a practical, behavior-oriented framework for evaluating whether teams, stakeholders, and the broader organization are genuinely operating in an agile manner. It goes beyond process compliance to examine autonomy, trust, quality, experimentation, and continuous improvement. Technology professionals who regularly assess themselves against this checklist will surface hidden dysfunction, reinforce productive habits, and build the cultural foundation that sustainable agile delivery requires.
