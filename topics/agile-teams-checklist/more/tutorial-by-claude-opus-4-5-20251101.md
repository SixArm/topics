## Agile Teams Checklist: A Comprehensive Tutorial

This tutorial provides a detailed examination of the agile teams checklist, originally developed by Mountain Goat Software. This checklist serves as a diagnostic and aspirational tool for technology teams seeking to evaluate and improve their agile maturity.

## Overview and Purpose

The agile teams checklist addresses three interconnected dimensions of organizational agility: team behaviors, stakeholder engagement, and organizational culture. Rather than focusing on specific ceremonies or artifacts, this checklist emphasizes the underlying mindset and behaviors that distinguish truly agile organizations from those merely going through the motions.

Use this checklist to:
- Assess current team and organizational agile maturity
- Identify specific areas for improvement
- Guide retrospective discussions
- Set concrete goals for agile transformation
- Evaluate whether agile values are being lived, not just practiced

## Team Behaviors and Characteristics

High-performing agile teams exhibit specific behaviors that enable them to deliver value consistently. The following characteristics define what it means to operate as a genuinely agile team.

### Problem-Solving Orientation

| Traditional Approach | Agile Approach |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Teams receive task lists to execute | Teams receive problems to solve |
| Work is predefined and prescribed | Teams determine how to achieve outcomes |
| Success measured by task completion | Success measured by problem resolution |

Teams should have problems to solve rather than lists of tasks to perform. This distinction matters because problem-oriented teams can adapt their approach as they learn, while task-oriented teams simply execute instructions without flexibility.

### Autonomy and Decision-Making

Agile teams require genuine autonomy to be effective:

- Teams are generally able to make decisions without a manager's approval
- Teams decide how to execute work
- Teams are responsible for monitoring and managing their own performance

This autonomy is not about removing accountability. Rather, it shifts accountability from following instructions correctly to achieving outcomes effectively.

### Continuous Improvement

Effective agile teams never consider themselves finished learning:

- Teams adopt appropriate practices and improve them over time
- Teams actively seek ways to improve how they work and collaborate
- Teams seek to learn relevant, new skills
- Teams continue to learn and improve skills they've already mastered
- Teams have all received basic training on agile concepts

### Cross-Team Collaboration

No team operates in isolation. Successful agile organizations ensure:

- Teams working on a common product proactively coordinate their work
- Teams openly share new ideas, practices, and experiences with other teams
- Teams are rarely delayed waiting for work to be completed by another team

### Quality and Delivery

The following behaviors ensure consistent delivery of valuable work:

| Behavior | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Teams quickly act on stakeholder feedback | Ensures the product meets actual needs |
| Teams make every effort to fully complete planned work | Avoids accumulating technical debt and partial work |
| Teams responsibly deliver high quality work | Builds trust and reduces rework |
| Teams welcome rather than resist changing requirements | Enables responsiveness to market conditions |
| Teams collaborate to finish items | Prevents bottlenecks and knowledge silos |

### Psychological Safety and Transparency

High-performing teams require an environment where honesty is valued:

- Teams admit challenges and mistakes
- Teams feel safe to express dissenting views
- Teams start work even when some open issues or questions remain

Without psychological safety, teams hide problems until they become crises and avoid the healthy conflict that leads to better solutions.

### Flexibility and Motivation

Agile teams demonstrate flexibility in their skills and clarity in their purpose:

- Teams are willing to work outside their specialties to achieve team goals
- Teams understand and are motivated by why they are performing their work
- Teams take pride in their craft
- Teams choose and use various ways of communicating

## Stakeholder Responsibilities

Agile transformation fails when teams adopt new practices but stakeholders continue operating with traditional expectations. Stakeholders must actively support agile ways of working.

### Planning and Prioritization

Stakeholders must adapt their approach to planning:

| Stakeholder Responsibility | Practical Implication |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Know which factors determine priorities and deadlines | Transparent prioritization criteria enable teams to make aligned decisions |
| Accept plans expressed with ranges | Acknowledge uncertainty rather than demanding false precision |
| Accept that plans may need to change | Respond to learning rather than punishing adaptation |

### Active Engagement

Stakeholders cannot be passive recipients of work:

- Stakeholders have frequent opportunities to evaluate the product
- Stakeholders champion agile values and agile principles
- Stakeholders communicate what they hope to achieve by becoming more agile

### Respecting Team Autonomy

Perhaps the most challenging stakeholder behavior is trusting teams:

- Stakeholders see quality as a right that the team has and they respect it
- Stakeholders delegate authority to teams and don't take it back at the first sign of trouble
- Stakeholders support teams in experimenting by not punishing unsuccessful experiments

When stakeholders reclaim authority during difficulties, they undermine the trust essential for agile success.

### People Development

Stakeholders must shift from performance management to people development:

- Stakeholders actively encourage teams to learn new skills and ways of working
- Stakeholders develop people rather than manage their performance

This shift recognizes that motivated, skilled individuals produce better outcomes than closely managed workers following detailed instructions.

## Organizational Culture and Practices

Beyond individual teams and stakeholders, organizational culture determines whether agile practices will flourish or wither.

### Decision-Making and Planning

The organization's approach to decisions and plans reveals its true commitment to agility:

- Decisions are made quickly, sometimes with incomplete knowledge
- Plans are based on data and experience
- As more is learned, plans are updated rather than remaining based on outdated information
- Dependencies between teams are proactively identified and addressed

### Trust and Psychological Safety

Trust operates at multiple levels in agile organizations:

| Trust Dimension | Manifestation |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Intent | People are assumed to have acted with good intentions even when something goes wrong |
| Reciprocity | Trust is reciprocal within the team and with stakeholders |
| Commitments | People honor commitments and keep promises |
| Problem resolution | When problems arise between teams, everyone focuses on a solution rather than blame |

### Experimentation and Learning

Organizations that genuinely embrace agility create safe spaces for experimentation:

- A non-punitive attitude leads to the team's willingness to experiment with new tools, technologies, and ways of working
- An educated executive sponsor ensures the change agent is empowered to make decisions
- Change agents are in place to help support and guide the transition

### Communication Practices

Agile organizations balance documentation with direct communication:

- Although formal documentation may exist, it is supplemented by conversations to the extent possible
- Outside groups that partner with the team are aware of how this new way of working may affect their interactions

### Value Delivery Focus

The organization's priorities must align with agile principles:

- The organization places a higher value on finished work than it does on the number of work items in process
- The early release of a good product is generally favored over the later release of a perfect product
- Quality is rarely, if ever, sacrificed to meet a deadline

### Scaling and Sustainability

Sustainable agile adoption requires:

- Agile practices are being implemented beyond the group in which agile began
- Most people are assigned to only one team

Single-team assignment deserves particular attention. Context-switching between multiple teams destroys productivity and prevents the deep collaboration that agile requires.

## Using the Checklist Effectively

### Assessment Approach

Rate each item using a simple scale:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Consistently True | This behavior is the norm |
| Sometimes True | This happens but not reliably |
| Rarely True | This is the exception |
| Never True | This does not occur |

### Prioritization

Not all items carry equal weight for every organization. Prioritize based on:

- Items where the gap between current state and desired state is largest
- Items that serve as prerequisites for other improvements
- Items that align with current organizational challenges

### Common Patterns

Organizations often discover patterns in their assessments:

- **Team behaviors strong, stakeholder behaviors weak**: Teams have adopted agile practices but face organizational resistance
- **Stakeholder behaviors strong, team behaviors weak**: Leadership supports agile but teams lack training or have not internalized practices
- **Cultural items weak across the board**: Deeper organizational change is needed before tactical improvements will stick

## Key Takeaways

The agile teams checklist reveals that genuine agility extends far beyond specific practices. True agility requires:

1. **Team autonomy** balanced with accountability for outcomes
2. **Stakeholder engagement** that supports rather than undermines team decisions
3. **Organizational culture** that values learning, trust, and finished work over activity

Use this checklist not as a one-time assessment but as an ongoing tool for reflection and improvement. The goal is not to check every box but to continuously close the gap between current practices and agile ideals.
