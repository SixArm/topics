# Disaster recovery

Question: What two metrics are most critical for defining disaster recovery requirements, specifying maximum acceptable downtime and maximum acceptable data loss respectively?

- [ ] Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
- [ ] Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Service Level Objective (SLO)
- [ ] Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- [ ] Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</p>
  <p>RTO defines the maximum allowable downtime for a system or application before business operations are severely impacted, while RPO defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. Together, these two metrics guide the selection of appropriate recovery strategies, technologies, and backup frequencies to meet business requirements.</p>
