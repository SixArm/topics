  <p>To convert visitors into leads or customers by presenting a compelling offer and clear call-to-action</p>
  <p>A landing page is a standalone web page specifically designed to persuade visitors to take a specific action, such as signing up, purchasing, or downloading. Unlike general website pages, landing pages focus on a single conversion goal and are commonly used in PPC advertising, email marketing, and social media campaigns to drive traffic to specific offers or promotions.</p>
