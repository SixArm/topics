# Small business loan

A small business loan is a financial product that enables small business owners to borrow capital from a lender to fund operations, purchase inventory or equipment, expand their business, or cover other business-related expenses. For technology professionals -- whether launching a startup, scaling a SaaS platform, or investing in infrastructure -- understanding the mechanics of small business lending is essential for making informed financial decisions. Small business loans are offered by banks, credit unions, online lenders, and government-backed programs, each with distinct terms, qualification criteria, and strategic trade-offs.

## Why small business loans matter in tech

Technology ventures frequently require significant upfront capital before generating revenue. Hardware procurement, cloud infrastructure, hiring engineers, and product development cycles all demand funding that may exceed what founders can self-finance. Small business loans provide a non-dilutive financing option, meaning the borrower retains full ownership equity, unlike venture capital or angel investment. For technology professionals who want to maintain control of their company while accessing growth capital, debt financing through small business loans is a critical tool.

## Types of small business loans

Small business loans come in several forms, each suited to different business needs and financial situations.

| Loan Type | Structure | Typical Term | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Term loan | Lump sum repaid in fixed installments | 1-10 years | Equipment purchases, expansion projects |
| Line of credit | Revolving credit up to a limit; interest on drawn amount only | Renewable annually | Cash flow management, variable expenses |
| SBA loan | Government-backed loan with favorable terms | Up to 25 years | Startups and businesses that lack traditional collateral |
| Equipment financing | Loan secured by the equipment being purchased | Matches equipment useful life | Servers, hardware, specialized technology |
| Microloans | Small loans typically under $50,000 | Up to 6 years | Early-stage businesses, proof of concept |
| Invoice financing | Advance against outstanding invoices | 30-90 days | B2B companies with long payment cycles |

## Term loans

Term loans are the most straightforward form of small business lending. The borrower receives a lump sum of cash and repays it over a set period, typically one to five years, though some lenders offer terms up to ten years. Term loans can be secured, meaning they require collateral such as equipment or real estate, or unsecured, relying primarily on the borrower's creditworthiness. Interest rates may be fixed, providing predictable monthly payments, or variable, fluctuating with market conditions. Term loans are well-suited for one-time capital expenditures such as purchasing servers, outfitting an office, or funding a product launch.

## Lines of credit

A line of credit provides a revolving credit facility that allows the business owner to borrow up to a predetermined limit, draw funds as needed, and repay them over time. Interest is charged only on the amount actually borrowed, not the full credit limit. This flexibility makes lines of credit particularly useful for managing irregular cash flows, covering payroll during slow periods, or handling unexpected expenses. For technology companies with seasonal revenue patterns or milestone-based contract payments, a line of credit can serve as a financial buffer that prevents operational disruptions.

## SBA loans

SBA loans are backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, a federal agency that partners with approved lenders to reduce the risk of lending to small businesses. Because the SBA guarantees a portion of the loan, lenders are more willing to extend credit to businesses that might not qualify for conventional financing. SBA loans typically offer lower interest rates, longer repayment terms (up to 25 years for real estate), and lower down payment requirements than traditional bank loans. The most common SBA programs include:

- **SBA 7(a) loans**: The most versatile program, used for working capital, equipment, and real estate, with loan amounts up to $5 million.
- **SBA 504 loans**: Designed for major fixed-asset purchases such as commercial real estate or large equipment, with loan amounts up to $5.5 million.
- **SBA microloans**: Smaller loans up to $50,000, often administered through nonprofit intermediaries, intended for startups and early-stage businesses.

The trade-off is that SBA loans involve more paperwork, longer approval timelines, and stricter documentation requirements than conventional loans.

## Qualification criteria

Lenders evaluate several factors when reviewing a small business loan application. Understanding these criteria helps borrowers prepare stronger applications and identify the most suitable lending options.

- **Credit score**: Personal credit scores above 680 generally qualify for favorable terms. Business credit scores from agencies such as Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax are also evaluated for established companies.
- **Time in business**: Most traditional lenders require at least two years of operating history. SBA loans and online lenders may accept businesses with shorter track records.
- **Revenue and cash flow**: Lenders assess whether the business generates sufficient revenue to cover loan payments. A debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.25 or higher is a common benchmark.
- **Collateral**: Secured loans require assets that the lender can claim if the borrower defaults. Technology companies with limited physical assets may need to offer personal guarantees or explore unsecured options.
- **Business plan**: Particularly for newer businesses, a detailed business plan demonstrating market opportunity, competitive positioning, and financial projections strengthens the application.

## Interest rates and costs

Interest rates on small business loans vary significantly based on the loan type, lender, borrower qualifications, and prevailing market conditions.

| Factor | Impact on Rate |
|---|---|
| Higher credit score | Lower interest rate |
| Longer time in business | Lower interest rate |
| Secured (collateral provided) | Lower interest rate |
| SBA-backed | Generally lower than conventional |
| Online or alternative lender | Higher rate, faster approval |
| Shorter repayment term | Lower total interest cost |

Beyond the stated interest rate, borrowers should evaluate the annual percentage rate (APR), which includes fees such as origination fees, closing costs, and servicing charges. Some lenders also impose prepayment penalties for paying off the loan early, which can affect the total cost of borrowing.

## Application process

The typical application process for a small business loan involves several steps:

- **Assess needs and eligibility**: Determine how much capital is needed, what it will be used for, and which loan types align with the business profile.
- **Gather documentation**: Prepare financial statements, tax returns, bank statements, a business plan, and legal documents such as articles of incorporation and business licenses.
- **Compare lenders**: Evaluate offers from multiple lenders, comparing interest rates, fees, repayment terms, and approval timelines.
- **Submit the application**: Provide the required documentation and respond promptly to any lender requests for additional information.
- **Review and accept terms**: Carefully review the loan agreement, including repayment schedule, covenants, default provisions, and any personal guarantee requirements before signing.

## Advantages and disadvantages

Small business loans offer meaningful benefits but also carry risks that borrowers must weigh carefully.

**Advantages:**
- Retain full ownership equity, unlike equity financing.
- Predictable repayment schedules facilitate financial planning.
- Interest payments are typically tax-deductible.
- Building a track record of loan repayment strengthens business credit.

**Disadvantages:**
- Debt obligations must be met regardless of business performance.
- Collateral requirements may put personal or business assets at risk.
- Qualification can be difficult for pre-revenue startups.
- Interest costs reduce overall profitability.

## Summary

A small business loan is a debt-based financing instrument that provides capital for operations, growth, or asset acquisition while allowing the borrower to retain full ownership of their business. Loans come in multiple forms including term loans, lines of credit, SBA-backed loans, and equipment financing, each with distinct terms, costs, and qualification requirements. For technology professionals, small business loans represent a non-dilutive funding option that complements or substitutes for equity-based approaches, provided the borrower carefully evaluates interest rates, repayment obligations, and the impact of debt on cash flow and long-term financial health.
