  <p>Recording and tracking user activities and system events for monitoring and auditing</p>
  <p>In the AAAA framework (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting, and Auditing), Accounting specifically refers to capturing relevant data about user logins, actions performed, resources accessed, and other system events. This data supports forensic analysis, compliance verification, incident response, performance monitoring, and security threat detection. It is distinct from Authentication (verifying identity) and Authorization (controlling access permissions).</p>
