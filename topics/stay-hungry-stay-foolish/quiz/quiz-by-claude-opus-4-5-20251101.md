  <p>Never lose curiosity and drive for learning, and don't be afraid to take risks and make mistakes</p>
  <p>Steve Jobs used this phrase from The Whole Earth Catalog's 1974 final issue in his 2005 Stanford commencement speech. "Hungry" means constantly seeking new ideas and knowledge, pushing beyond perceived limits, and never becoming complacent. "Foolish" means taking risks, thinking outside the box, following intuition, and not being afraid to fail—even if it means going against conventional wisdom.</p>
