  <p>Object-Oriented Design</p>
  <p>Object-Oriented Design is based on the use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent the various elements of the software system. It involves identifying the objects needed to support the system's functionality and designing the system around those objects. This approach is widely used in modern software development because it promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance through concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>
