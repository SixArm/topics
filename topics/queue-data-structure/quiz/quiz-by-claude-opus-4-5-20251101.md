  <p>First-In-First-Out (FIFO)</p>
  <p>A queue follows the FIFO principle, meaning the element that was added first is the first one to be removed. This is similar to a line of people waiting at a ticket counter—the person who arrives first gets served first. This fundamental property distinguishes queues from stacks (which use LIFO) and is essential for use cases like task scheduling, breadth-first search, and request processing.</p>
