  <p>To account for uncertainties in task durations and resource availability</p>
  <p>In critical chain project management, buffers are strategically placed at key points in the critical chain to absorb variations and uncertainties in how long tasks actually take and whether resources are available when needed. This helps ensure the project stays on track and can be completed on time, even when individual tasks don't go exactly as planned.</p>
