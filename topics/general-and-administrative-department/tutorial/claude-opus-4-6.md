# General and Administrative (G&A) department

The General and Administrative (G&A) department serves as the operational backbone of a technology company. It encompasses the critical support functions that keep a business running, from financial management and legal compliance to human resources and IT infrastructure. While engineering and product teams build what a company sells, the G&A department ensures the organization itself is healthy, compliant, and efficient. For technology professionals, understanding G&A is essential because these functions directly shape budgets, hiring pipelines, vendor contracts, security policies, and the day-to-day environment in which technical work happens.

## Core Functions of G&A

The G&A department typically owns several distinct functional areas, each with its own responsibilities and leadership. These functions operate together to provide a cohesive administrative foundation for the entire organization.

| Function | Primary Responsibilities | Key Stakeholders |
|---|---|---|
| Financial Management | Budgeting, forecasting, accounting, financial reporting, internal auditing | CFO, controllers, FP&A analysts |
| Legal Compliance | Contracts, intellectual property, regulatory compliance, dispute resolution | General counsel, compliance officers |
| Human Resources | Recruiting, hiring, payroll, benefits administration, employee relations | CHRO, HR business partners, recruiters |
| Facilities Management | Office space, equipment, supplies, physical security | Facilities managers, office managers |
| Information Technology | Hardware, software, networks, cybersecurity, internal tooling | CIO/CTO (internal IT), system administrators |
| Administrative Services | Reception, mailroom, office management, executive assistance | Office managers, executive assistants |

## Financial Management

The financial management function within G&A handles budgeting, forecasting, accounting, financial reporting, and internal auditing. In a technology company, this team is responsible for tracking burn rate, managing capital expenditures on infrastructure, and producing the financial statements that investors, boards, and regulators require.

For technology professionals, the finance function matters in several concrete ways:

- **Headcount planning** determines how many engineers and designers a team can hire in a given quarter.
- **Capital versus operating expense classification** influences whether the company buys or leases servers, licenses software, or invests in cloud infrastructure.
- **Revenue recognition** rules affect how product teams scope and schedule feature releases, particularly for enterprise software sold under multi-year contracts.
- **Internal auditing** establishes controls around access to financial systems, which often intersects with application security and SOC 2 compliance efforts.

## Legal Compliance

The legal compliance function ensures the company operates within all applicable laws and regulations. This includes managing contracts, protecting intellectual property, handling disputes, and navigating the regulatory landscape specific to the company's industry and markets.

For technology organizations, legal compliance surfaces in areas that engineers and product managers encounter regularly:

- **Software licensing**: Ensuring open-source components comply with their license terms (GPL, MIT, Apache, etc.) and that proprietary licenses are properly managed.
- **Data privacy regulations**: Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and other data protection frameworks that directly constrain how technical teams collect, store, and process user data.
- **Intellectual property**: Patent filings, trade secret protections, and invention assignment agreements that govern who owns the code and innovations employees create.
- **Vendor contracts**: Negotiating terms with cloud providers, SaaS vendors, and technology partners, including SLAs, data processing agreements, and liability provisions.

## Human Resources

The human resources function within G&A handles recruiting and hiring, employee benefits, payroll administration, and employee relations including conflict resolution. In technology companies, HR is often the team that shapes engineering culture through hiring standards, compensation benchmarking, and performance management frameworks.

Key HR activities that directly affect technology teams include:

- **Technical recruiting pipelines** that source, screen, and close candidates for engineering, product, and design roles.
- **Compensation and equity programs** including salary bands, stock option grants, RSU vesting schedules, and bonus structures.
- **Performance review cycles** that determine promotions, raises, and career progression for technical staff.
- **Employee relations** covering conflict resolution, workplace investigations, and the policies that govern remote work, flexible schedules, and team norms.
- **Learning and development** budgets for conferences, certifications, training platforms, and internal knowledge-sharing programs.

## Facilities Management

The facilities management function oversees the company's physical spaces, equipment, and supplies. While remote and hybrid work have reduced the centrality of this function for some technology companies, facilities management remains critical for organizations that operate data centers, hardware labs, or collaborative office environments.

Facilities responsibilities include managing office leases and build-outs, procuring and maintaining equipment, ensuring physical security through badge access and surveillance systems, and coordinating workplace safety compliance. For technology professionals working on-site, the facilities team determines everything from desk configurations and meeting room availability to the reliability of power and cooling systems in on-premises server rooms.

## Information Technology (Internal IT)

The internal IT function within G&A is distinct from the product engineering organization. While product engineering builds what the company sells, internal IT manages the systems and infrastructure that employees use to do their work. This includes corporate networks, endpoint management, identity and access management, SaaS application administration, and cybersecurity operations.

In technology companies, the boundary between internal IT and engineering can blur. Common areas of overlap and tension include:

- **Identity providers and single sign-on** systems that serve both internal tools and customer-facing products.
- **Security policies** around device management, VPN usage, and acceptable use that engineering teams must follow.
- **Shadow IT** where engineering teams adopt tools and services outside of IT-approved channels, creating governance and security gaps.
- **Infrastructure shared services** such as CI/CD pipelines, monitoring platforms, and cloud account management that may be owned by either IT or engineering depending on the organization.

## Administrative Services

The administrative services function provides day-to-day operational support including reception, mailroom, office management, and executive assistance. While often overlooked, this function ensures that the logistics of running an organization operate without friction. In technology startups, administrative services may be handled by a small operations team or outsourced to managed service providers. In larger enterprises, this function scales to include travel coordination, event planning, and vendor management for office services.

## G&A Cost Structure

G&A expenses are a significant line item on any company's income statement. Understanding how these costs are categorized and managed is important for technology leaders who participate in budgeting and resource allocation decisions.

| Cost Category | Examples | Typical Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Personnel | Salaries, benefits, payroll taxes for G&A staff | Largely fixed; scales with company headcount |
| Professional services | Outside legal counsel, audit firms, consultants | Variable; spikes during fundraising, M&A, or audits |
| Facilities | Rent, utilities, maintenance, insurance | Fixed or semi-fixed; tied to lease terms |
| Technology | Internal IT systems, SaaS subscriptions, security tools | Semi-variable; grows with headcount and complexity |
| General office | Supplies, postage, travel, meals | Variable; discretionary and often cut first in downturns |

Technology companies typically target G&A expenses at 5-15% of total revenue, with early-stage startups running higher as a percentage due to lower revenue and the fixed-cost nature of many G&A functions.

## G&A in Startups Versus Enterprises

The scope and structure of the G&A department varies significantly based on company size and maturity.

In early-stage startups, G&A functions are often consolidated under a single operations leader or even handled by founders directly. A startup with fewer than 50 employees may have one person covering HR, office management, and basic bookkeeping, with legal and accounting outsourced to external firms. The emphasis is on speed and pragmatism over process and compliance.

In mature enterprises, each G&A function is a fully staffed department with its own leadership hierarchy, specialized roles, and formal processes. A Fortune 500 technology company will have a General Counsel leading a legal team of dozens, a CHRO overseeing hundreds of HR professionals, and a CFO managing a finance organization with controllers, tax specialists, and treasury analysts. The emphasis shifts toward governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance at scale.

For technology professionals moving between these environments, the key difference is the degree of structure and self-service. In startups, engineers often handle their own vendor procurement, expense reporting, and even aspects of hiring. In enterprises, these activities are governed by formal processes, approval workflows, and specialized G&A staff.

## Summary

The General and Administrative department provides the essential operational infrastructure that enables a technology company to function beyond its core product and engineering activities. Spanning financial management, legal compliance, human resources, facilities, internal IT, and administrative services, G&A ensures the organization remains solvent, compliant, staffed, and operationally sound. Technology professionals benefit from understanding these functions because they directly influence hiring capacity, budget availability, security policies, vendor relationships, and the regulatory constraints within which technical work must be executed.
