  <p>To enable communication between distributed applications across different computers</p>
  <p>RPC is a software architecture approach specifically designed for communication between different applications or software components that are distributed across different computers or devices. It allows a client program to call functions or procedures on a remote server as if they were local, handling the complexity of packaging requests, sending them over the network, and returning results.</p>
