  <p>Licensing agreements, joint development agreements, and assignment agreements</p>
  <p>Technology transfer agreements are legal contracts between technology owners (such as universities or research institutions) and recipients who want to acquire rights to use or commercialize technology. The three main types are: licensing agreements (granting permission to use the technology), joint development agreements (collaborative arrangements to further develop technology), and assignment agreements (transferring ownership of intellectual property rights). These agreements typically include provisions for intellectual property rights, payment terms, use restrictions, confidentiality, and dispute resolution.</p>
