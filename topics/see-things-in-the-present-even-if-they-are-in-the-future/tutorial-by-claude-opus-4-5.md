# See Things in the Present, Even If They Are in the Future: Tutorial

## Overview

"See things in the present, even if they are in the future" is a quotation by Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corporation. This statement captures the essence of visionary leadership: the ability to perceive future possibilities with the clarity and conviction of present realities. For agile change technology professionals, Ellison's insight provides a framework for strategic thinking that balances present awareness with future orientation, enabling leaders and teams to shape the future proactively rather than merely react to it as it unfolds.

## Key Concepts and Explanation

### Visionary Thinking

The quote describes a specific cognitive capability: the ability to envision future states so vividly that they feel as real and tangible as the present. Visionary leaders do not simply predict what might happen; they see what could happen and then work backward to determine what must be done now to make that future a reality. This is not wishful thinking -- it is a disciplined form of strategic imagination grounded in deep understanding of current trends, technologies, and market dynamics.

### Grounding Vision in Present Reality

Ellison's quote is not about ignoring the present in favor of dreams about the future. It is about having a clear understanding of present realities -- strengths, weaknesses, trends, and constraints -- while simultaneously seeing beyond them. The word "present" appears twice in the quote for good reason: the future must be seen with the clarity of present observation. This means that visionary thinking requires rigorous analysis of what is happening now as the foundation for imagining what could happen next.

### Breaking Free from Current Constraints

The quote suggests a mindset that is not limited by current realities or constraints. Many people and organizations suffer from "present bias" -- they cannot imagine anything fundamentally different from what exists today. Ellison's approach encourages leaders to challenge the status quo, question assumptions, and envision possibilities that current limitations might seem to preclude. This requires openness to innovation, willingness to challenge conventional wisdom, and the courage to take risks.

### Proactive Shaping Versus Reactive Adaptation

Perhaps the most actionable aspect of this quote is its emphasis on proactivity. Rather than waiting for the future to arrive and then adapting to it, Ellison advocates for actively shaping the future through present decisions and actions. This aligns closely with agile principles: rather than trying to predict and plan for every contingency, agile teams take action, learn from results, and use that learning to shape what comes next.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Develop scenario planning capabilities.** Regularly engage in structured scenario planning exercises where the team imagines multiple possible futures. For each scenario, identify the signals that would indicate that future is emerging and the actions the team should take now to prepare for or influence it.

2. **Monitor trends and weak signals.** Establish practices for scanning the environment -- technology trends, market shifts, customer behavior changes, competitive moves, and regulatory developments. Pay attention to weak signals: early indicators of change that most people dismiss or overlook.

3. **Create a compelling vision statement.** Articulate a specific, vivid picture of the future state you want to create. This vision should be concrete enough to guide daily decisions and inspiring enough to motivate sustained effort. Share it widely and refer to it frequently.

4. **Work backward from the future.** Once you have a clear vision of the future, work backward to identify the milestones, capabilities, and decisions that must happen between now and then. Create a roadmap that connects present actions to future outcomes. This approach -- sometimes called "backcasting" -- ensures that today's work is always in service of tomorrow's goals.

5. **Challenge present assumptions regularly.** Dedicate time in retrospectives, strategy sessions, and planning meetings to question fundamental assumptions about how your business works, what customers want, and what technology makes possible. Ask "what if?" frequently and take the answers seriously.

6. **Invest in experiments that test the future.** Use prototypes, pilots, and proof-of-concept projects to explore future possibilities. These experiments allow you to experience a future scenario in miniature and learn from it before committing significant resources.

7. **Build adaptable architectures and organizations.** Design systems and teams that can evolve as the future unfolds. Avoid over-committing to architectures, technologies, or organizational structures that are optimized for today's reality but cannot adapt to tomorrow's. Modular designs, microservices, and cross-functional teams all support future adaptability.

8. **Cultivate courage and conviction.** Acting on a vision of the future requires courage, because the future is uncertain and present-day critics will always question decisions based on what they cannot yet see. Build organizational support for bold moves by communicating the vision clearly, demonstrating early wins, and building a track record of successful foresight.

## Key Takeaway

Larry Ellison's quotation teaches agile change professionals that the most effective leaders and teams do not merely respond to the future as it arrives -- they see it coming, understand it deeply, and act in the present to shape it. By grounding visionary thinking in rigorous analysis of current realities, challenging assumptions about what is possible, and taking disciplined action today to create tomorrow's outcomes, agile professionals can transform uncertainty from a threat into an opportunity. The future belongs to those who can see it clearly in the present and have the courage to act on what they see.
