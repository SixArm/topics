# Agile Manifesto

Question: According to the Agile Manifesto, which of the following pairs correctly represents what is valued MORE (left) over what is valued LESS (right)?

- [ ] Following a plan over responding to change
- [ ] Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation over working software
- [ ] Processes and tools over individuals and interactions

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</p>
  <p>The Agile Manifesto explicitly states four core values, one of which is "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation." The other options are reversed from the manifesto's actual values. The manifesto values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, and responding to change over following a plan. While the manifesto acknowledges there is value in the items on the right, it emphasizes valuing the items on the left more.</p>
