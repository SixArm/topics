# Agile Manifesto: Tutorial

## Overview

The Agile Manifesto is the foundational document of the agile software development movement. Created in 2001 by seventeen software practitioners, it articulates four core value statements that guide how software teams should approach their work. The manifesto is deliberately concise, consisting of a preamble and four value pairs.

## The Preamble

"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."

This opening line establishes two important principles:

1. **Learning by doing**: Agile is rooted in practice, not theory. The signatories arrived at these values through hands-on experience building software.
2. **Continuous discovery**: The word "uncovering" signals that agile is not a fixed destination but an ongoing process of improvement.

## The Four Values

### 1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools

Software is built by people, and the quality of their communication and collaboration matters more than the sophistication of their tools or the rigor of their processes. This does not mean processes and tools are unimportant—it means they should serve people, not constrain them.

### 2. Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation

A functioning product provides more value and clearer feedback than detailed written specifications. Documentation has its place, but it should not become a substitute for actually building and delivering software.

### 3. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation

Building the right product requires ongoing dialogue with the customer, not a one-time agreement about requirements. Contracts are necessary, but the relationship should be collaborative, not adversarial.

### 4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan

Requirements evolve, markets shift, and new information emerges. Teams that can adapt to these changes deliver better outcomes than teams that rigidly execute a predetermined plan. Planning is still valuable, but the plan must remain flexible.

## The Closing Statement

"That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

This is frequently overlooked but critically important. The manifesto does not reject processes, documentation, contracts, or plans. It establishes a priority order: when there is tension between the items on the left and right, choose the left.

## Applying the Manifesto in Practice

### For Teams

- Use the four values as a decision-making filter when facing trade-offs
- Revisit the manifesto during retrospectives to assess whether your team's practices align with these values
- Avoid treating the manifesto as a set of rules; treat it as a set of guiding principles

### For Organizations

- Evaluate whether organizational policies support or undermine these values
- Recognize that adopting agile means changing culture, not just processes
- Ensure that leadership understands and supports the manifesto's priorities

### Common Pitfalls

- **Weaponizing the manifesto**: Using "individuals over processes" as justification for having no process at all
- **Ignoring the right side**: Abandoning documentation, contracts, and planning entirely
- **Treating it as a checklist**: The manifesto describes values, not practices—it tells you what to prioritize, not what to do

## Key Takeaway

The Agile Manifesto is a statement of priorities, not a methodology. It provides a compass for decision-making by establishing which considerations should take precedence when trade-offs arise. Its power lies in its simplicity and its focus on outcomes over dogma.
