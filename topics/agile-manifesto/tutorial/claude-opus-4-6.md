# Agile manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a foundational document in modern software development, published in February 2001 by seventeen software practitioners who gathered at a ski resort in Snowbird, Utah. These practitioners represented a range of lightweight development methodologies, including Extreme Programming, Scrum, DSDM, Crystal, and Feature-Driven Development. The manifesto they produced is deliberately concise: a preamble, four core values, and twelve supporting principles. Despite its brevity, the Agile Manifesto has reshaped how organizations around the world approach software delivery, project management, and product development.


## Historical Context

By the late 1990s, the dominant approach to software development was the Waterfall model, characterized by sequential phases of requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Large-scale projects frequently suffered from cost overruns, missed deadlines, and deliverables that failed to meet user needs. Several practitioners had independently developed alternative approaches that emphasized shorter cycles, close collaboration with customers, and adaptive planning.

In February 2001, seventeen of these practitioners met to find common ground. The attendees included Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, Robert C. Martin, Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, Alistair Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Jim Highsmith, and others. Rather than prescribing a single methodology, they distilled their shared beliefs into a set of values and principles that any methodology could adopt. The result was the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.


## The Four Core Values

The manifesto states: "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:"

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

The manifesto adds a critical qualifier: "That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more." This means the manifesto does not reject processes, documentation, contracts, or plans. It establishes a priority ordering, asserting that human factors and adaptability matter more than rigid structures.

| Value (Preferred) | Over (Less Preferred) | Key Insight |
|---|---|---|
| Individuals and interactions | Processes and tools | The best tools are worthless without skilled, communicating people |
| Working software | Comprehensive documentation | Delivering functional product is the primary measure of progress |
| Customer collaboration | Contract negotiation | Ongoing partnership produces better outcomes than fixed-scope agreements |
| Responding to change | Following a plan | Adapting to new information outperforms adherence to an outdated plan |


## Value 1: Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools

This value places people at the center of software development. Processes and tools serve teams, not the other way around. A highly capable team with mediocre tools will generally outperform a mediocre team with excellent tools. This value encourages:

- Face-to-face communication and co-location where possible
- Cross-functional teams empowered to make decisions
- Trust in skilled professionals over bureaucratic oversight
- Lightweight processes that amplify collaboration rather than constrain it

Organizations that internalize this value invest in hiring, coaching, and team dynamics rather than relying solely on tooling and workflow enforcement.


## Value 2: Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation

This value does not advocate for zero documentation. It asserts that the primary deliverable is functional software, not specification documents. Traditional projects often spent months producing detailed requirements and design documents before writing a single line of code, only to discover that assumptions were wrong once the software was built. Agile teams prefer:

- Delivering working increments frequently, typically every one to four weeks
- Using the software itself as the most reliable form of communication about what has been built
- Producing documentation that is necessary and sufficient, rather than exhaustive
- Treating documentation as a living artifact that evolves alongside the software


## Value 3: Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation

Fixed-scope contracts create an adversarial relationship between the customer and the development team. When requirements are locked in advance, any change becomes a negotiation about scope, cost, and timeline. Agile teams prefer a collaborative model where:

- The customer is an active participant throughout development, not just at the beginning and end
- Requirements are discovered and refined iteratively as the team and customer learn together
- Success is measured by whether the delivered product solves the customer's actual problem, not whether it matches a specification written months earlier
- Trust and transparency replace contractual enforcement as the primary mechanism for alignment


## Value 4: Responding to Change Over Following a Plan

Software projects operate in environments of uncertainty. Market conditions shift, user needs evolve, competitors launch new features, and technology changes. A plan created at the start of a project is based on the least amount of knowledge the team will ever have. Agile teams embrace this reality by:

- Planning at multiple horizons: long-range vision, medium-term roadmap, and short-term iteration plans
- Treating plans as hypotheses to be tested rather than commitments to be honored
- Welcoming changing requirements, even late in development, as a competitive advantage
- Using feedback loops such as retrospectives, demos, and user testing to continuously adjust course


## The Twelve Principles

Behind the four values, the Agile Manifesto authors articulated twelve supporting principles that provide more concrete guidance:

1. Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
5. Build projects around motivated individuals; give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
6. Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development; sponsors, developers, and users should maintain a constant pace indefinitely
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
10. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly


## Common Misconceptions

The Agile Manifesto is frequently misinterpreted, leading to practices that contradict its intent:

- **"Agile means no documentation."** The manifesto values working software *more* than comprehensive documentation, not instead of it. Teams still need appropriate documentation for onboarding, compliance, and maintainability.
- **"Agile means no planning."** Agile teams plan continuously. They simply recognize that plans must adapt as new information emerges.
- **"Agile is a methodology."** The manifesto is a set of values and principles, not a prescriptive methodology. Scrum, Kanban, XP, and other frameworks are implementations that embody agile values to varying degrees.
- **"Agile means moving fast and breaking things."** Principle 9 explicitly calls for continuous attention to technical excellence. Sustainable pace and quality are core to the manifesto.
- **"Agile only applies to software."** While written for software development, the manifesto's values have been successfully applied to hardware development, marketing, education, and other domains.


## Agile Manifesto vs. Traditional Approaches

| Dimension | Agile Manifesto Approach | Traditional (Waterfall) Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Requirements | Discovered iteratively through collaboration | Defined comprehensively upfront |
| Planning | Adaptive, multi-horizon, continuously revised | Predictive, detailed, fixed at project start |
| Delivery | Frequent increments, typically 1-4 weeks | Single delivery at project end |
| Change | Welcomed as a competitive advantage | Controlled through formal change requests |
| Customer involvement | Continuous throughout the project | Primarily at start and end |
| Team structure | Self-organizing, cross-functional | Hierarchical, role-specialized |
| Measure of progress | Working software | Milestone completion, document sign-off |
| Risk management | Early delivery and feedback reduce risk | Upfront analysis attempts to eliminate risk |


## Adopting Agile Values in Practice

Organizations seeking to adopt the Agile Manifesto's values should focus on cultural change rather than process adoption alone. Key practices include:

- **Start with why.** Understand the values and principles before selecting a framework. Choosing Scrum or Kanban without understanding the underlying values leads to mechanical adoption without meaningful improvement.
- **Empower teams.** Give teams the authority to make decisions about how they work. Mandate outcomes, not methods.
- **Shorten feedback loops.** Deliver working software frequently and solicit feedback from real users. The shorter the feedback loop, the lower the cost of correcting mistakes.
- **Invest in people.** Hire for collaboration and learning ability. Provide coaching, training, and a psychologically safe environment.
- **Measure outcomes, not outputs.** Track customer satisfaction, lead time, and product quality rather than story points completed or hours logged.
- **Reflect and adapt.** Use retrospectives and other reflection practices to continuously improve how the team works.

## Summary

The Agile Manifesto is a short but powerful document that prioritizes people over processes, working software over documentation, collaboration over contracts, and adaptability over rigid planning. It does not prescribe specific practices but instead establishes a value system that guides decision-making. Its twelve principles provide actionable direction for teams seeking to deliver software that genuinely meets customer needs. When adopted as a cultural foundation rather than a checklist, the manifesto enables organizations to respond effectively to change, deliver value continuously, and build sustainable, high-performing teams.
