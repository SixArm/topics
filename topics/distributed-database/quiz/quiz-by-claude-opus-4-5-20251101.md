  <p>It enables efficient data sharing, improved availability, fault tolerance, and scalability across multiple sites</p>
  <p>Distributed databases store data across multiple interconnected sites, which reduces data redundancy, improves data availability and fault tolerance, and allows the system to scale more effectively.
