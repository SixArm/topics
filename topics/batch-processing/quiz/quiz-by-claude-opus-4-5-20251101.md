  <p>Batch processing collects and processes data as a group all at once rather than as it is received</p>
  <p>Batch processing is defined by collecting transactions, storing them, and processing them together as a single batch. This contrasts with real-time processing where data is processed immediately upon receipt. This approach is particularly effective for handling large volumes of data efficiently and cost-effectively, though it may not be suitable for applications requiring immediate feedback.</p>
