  <p>Lower overhead costs due to not requiring separate commercial space</p>
  <p>Cottage businesses are home-based operations that don't require a separate storefront or commercial space, which significantly reduces overhead costs. This allows entrepreneurs to start on a small scale and test business viability without committing significant capital—a key consideration for technology professionals evaluating lean startup approaches or side projects.</p>
