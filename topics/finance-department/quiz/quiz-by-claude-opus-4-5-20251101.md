  <p>Managing the company's liquidity, investments, and financing activities</p>
  <p>The treasury function is specifically responsible for managing the company's liquidity (ensuring sufficient cash is available), investments (deploying excess cash effectively), and financing activities (securing appropriate funding). This distinguishes it from related functions like accounting (which records transactions), taxation (which handles tax obligations), and investor relations (which manages investor communications).</p>
