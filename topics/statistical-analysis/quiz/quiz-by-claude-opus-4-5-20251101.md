  <p>Descriptive statistics summarizes data features, while inferential statistics draws conclusions about a population from a sample</p>
  <p>Descriptive statistics focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of data (such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation), whereas inferential statistics involves making inferences or drawing conclusions about a larger population based on data from a sample. Understanding this distinction is fundamental for technology professionals who need to analyze data correctly—knowing when to simply describe what the data shows versus when to make broader predictions or generalizations.</p>
