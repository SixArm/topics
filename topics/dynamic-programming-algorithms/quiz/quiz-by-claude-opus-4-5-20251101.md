# Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Question: What is the primary benefit of dynamic programming that distinguishes it from naive recursive approaches?

- [ ] It uses parallel processing to solve subproblems simultaneously
- [ ] It eliminates the need for recursion entirely by using iterative loops
- [ ] It stores solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computation
- [ ] It reduces space complexity by processing data in a streaming fashion

  <p>It stores solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computation</p>
  <p>Dynamic programming achieves efficiency by storing (memoizing) the solutions to subproblems in a table or array. This technique prevents the repeated computation of the same subproblems, which is a common inefficiency in naive recursive solutions. This approach is known as "memoization" (top-down) or "tabulation" (bottom-up), and it can dramatically reduce time complexity—often from exponential to polynomial time.</p>
