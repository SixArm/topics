  <p>It allows non-technical team members to contribute to test automation while keeping tests aligned with business objectives</p>
  <p>The combination of capture/playback testing with BDD creates a powerful synergy where the capture/playback approach makes test automation accessible for non-technical team members, while BDD ensures that automated tests remain aligned with business objectives through shared understanding expressed in natural language scenarios like "given-when-then" specifications.</p>
