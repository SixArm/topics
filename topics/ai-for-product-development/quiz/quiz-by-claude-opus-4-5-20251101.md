  <p>Ideation, data collection, model development, implementation, user experience design, testing, continuous improvement, and ethical considerations</p>
  <p>AI product development encompasses a comprehensive lifecycle that begins with identifying a market need (ideation), gathering and preparing training data (data collection), creating and training the AI model (model development), integrating it into systems (implementation), designing intuitive interfaces (user experience), validating performance (testing), iterating based on feedback (continuous improvement), and ensuring responsible AI practices (ethical considerations). This holistic approach ensures both technical excellence and responsible deployment.</p>
