  <p>Geographic proximity enabling easier communication, collaboration, and similar time zones</p>
  <p>Nearshoring's main benefit is the geographic closeness of the outsourcing partner, which facilitates communication and collaboration. Companies also gain advantages from similar or compatible time zones, cultural alignment, and linguistic familiarity—factors that are often challenging when outsourcing to distant locations. While nearshoring may offer some cost savings, labor costs in nearby countries are typically not as low as in more distant locations.</p>
