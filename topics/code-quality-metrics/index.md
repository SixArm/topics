# Code quality metrics

Code quality metrics provide quantitative measures to assess the health and maintainability of codebases. These metrics enable development teams to make data-driven decisions about code improvements and identify potential problem areas before they impact production systems.

Test coverage metrics represent one of the most fundamental measurements, indicating the percentage of code executed during automated testing. Line coverage, branch coverage, and function coverage provide different perspectives on how thoroughly tests exercise the codebase. However, high coverage percentages don't guarantee quality; they simply indicate which portions of code are being tested.

Examples: Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code, helping identify overly complex functions that may be difficult to test and maintain.Technical debt metrics quantify the estimated effort required to fix code quality issues. Defect density metrics track the number of bugs per lines of code or function points, providing insights into code quality trends over time.

When integrated with automated testing pipelines, these metrics enable continuous monitoring of code quality and can trigger automated actions such as blocking deployments when quality thresholds are exceeded, ensuring that only high-quality code reaches production environments.
