  <p>It articulates a clear, concise purpose focused on the value delivered to customers or the world</p>
  <p>Effective mission statements like Google's ("Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"), Tesla's ("Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"), and TED's ("Spread ideas") share a common trait: they express a clear, purpose-driven statement about the impact or value the organization aims to create. They focus on the "why" rather than the "what" or "how," inspiring stakeholders while providing strategic direction. They avoid operational details, financial metrics, or product listings in favor of articulating transformative goals.</p>
