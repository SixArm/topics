# How to give feedback

Question: When giving feedback to a colleague, which approach is most effective for ensuring your message is well-received and actionable?

- [ ] Use "you" statements to directly address what the person did wrong so there is no ambiguity
- [ ] Provide feedback publicly so others can learn from the situation as well
- [ ] Frame feedback using "I" statements to express your perspective and observations without being accusatory
- [ ] Focus primarily on assumptions about the person's intentions to address root causes

  <p>Frame feedback using "I" statements to express your perspective and observations without being accusatory</p>
  <p>Using "I" statements helps express your perspective and observations without sounding accusatory or confrontational. This approach makes the recipient more receptive because it focuses on your experience rather than placing blame. Combined with being objective (focusing on facts rather than assumptions), this technique creates a supportive environment where the person can hear the feedback and take constructive action.</p>
