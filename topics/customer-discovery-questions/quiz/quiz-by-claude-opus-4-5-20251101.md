  <p>To identify all stakeholders who influence purchasing decisions</p>
  <p>In B2B and complex B2C sales, purchasing decisions rarely involve just one person. Understanding who the other decision-makers are—such as budget holders, technical evaluators, end users, and executives—along with their individual priorities, helps you tailor your value proposition to address each stakeholder's concerns and navigate the buying process more effectively.</p>
