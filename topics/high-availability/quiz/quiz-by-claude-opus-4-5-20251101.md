# High availability (HA)

Question: What is the primary goal of high availability (HA) in system design?

- [ ] To maximize the processing speed of individual servers
- [ ] To reduce the total cost of hardware infrastructure
- [ ] To eliminate or minimize single points of failure and ensure continuous operation with minimal downtime
- [ ] To simplify system administration and reduce complexity

  <p>To eliminate or minimize single points of failure and ensure continuous operation with minimal downtime</p>
  <p>High availability is a design approach focused on ensuring systems remain continuously operational and accessible with minimal interruption. This is achieved through redundancy, fault tolerance, automatic failover mechanisms, and load balancing—all aimed at preventing any single component failure from bringing down the entire system.</p>
