  <p>To establish specific, measurable outcomes that indicate progress toward objectives</p>
  <p>Key Results are the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely (SMART) outcomes that a company wants to achieve in order to reach its objectives. While objectives are high-level goals, key results provide the concrete, quantifiable measures that indicate whether those objectives are being met. This distinction is fundamental to the OKR framework—objectives define what you want to accomplish, and key results define how you will know you've accomplished it.</p>
