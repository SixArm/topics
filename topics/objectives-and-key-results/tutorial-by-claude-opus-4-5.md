# Objectives and Key Results (OKRs): Tutorial

## Overview

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a goal-setting framework that helps organizations define what they want to achieve (Objectives) and how they will measure progress toward those achievements (Key Results). OKRs create alignment by connecting individual and team goals to organizational strategy.

## The Structure of OKRs

### Objectives

Objectives are the high-level goals the organization or team wants to achieve. Good objectives are:

- **Ambitious but achievable**: They should stretch the team without being impossible
- **Qualitative**: They describe a desired outcome in human terms, not a number
- **Inspiring**: They should motivate the team to action
- **Time-bound**: Typically set for a quarter

**Example**: "Become the most trusted platform for small business accounting"

### Key Results

Key Results are the specific, measurable outcomes that indicate progress toward the objective. Good key results are:

- **Specific**: Clearly defined with no ambiguity
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable with a clear metric
- **Achievable**: Realistic within the time period
- **Relevant**: Directly connected to the objective
- **Time-bound**: Have a clear deadline (usually the end of the quarter)

**Example key results for the objective above**:
- Increase Net Promoter Score from 40 to 55
- Reduce average customer support resolution time from 24 hours to 4 hours
- Achieve 95% uptime reliability

### Metrics (Tracking)

Metrics are the quantitative measures used to track progress toward key results. They should be easy to measure and report on regularly.

## How OKRs Work in Agile Teams

### Alignment Across Levels

OKRs cascade through the organization:

1. **Company OKRs**: Set the strategic direction (e.g., "Expand into the European market")
2. **Team OKRs**: Align team goals with company strategy (e.g., "Launch a localized product experience for European users")
3. **Individual OKRs**: Connect personal goals to team objectives (e.g., "Implement multi-currency support in the payment system")

### Connecting OKRs to Sprint Work

- Sprint goals should contribute to team OKRs
- Product backlog prioritization should be informed by which items advance key results
- Sprint reviews should reference OKR progress to demonstrate how completed work contributes to strategic goals

### Quarterly Cadence

OKRs are typically set and reviewed quarterly:

1. **Quarter start**: Define OKRs collaboratively
2. **Mid-quarter**: Check in on progress, adjust approach if needed
3. **Quarter end**: Score key results, reflect on what was learned
4. **Next quarter**: Set new OKRs informed by previous results

## Setting Effective OKRs

### Step 1: Start with the Objective

Ask: "What is the most important thing we need to achieve this quarter?" The answer should be a meaningful outcome, not a list of tasks.

### Step 2: Define 2-5 Key Results per Objective

For each objective, identify the measurable outcomes that would indicate success. Avoid having too many key results—focus creates impact.

### Step 3: Ensure Alignment

Check that team OKRs align with company OKRs. Each team's key results should contribute to broader organizational goals.

### Step 4: Make OKRs Visible

Post OKRs where everyone can see them. Transparency ensures alignment and accountability.

### Step 5: Review Regularly

Do not set OKRs and forget them. Check progress at least monthly. Adjust approach—not the OKRs themselves—if progress is off track.

## Benefits of OKRs

- **Focus**: Forces prioritization by limiting the number of objectives
- **Alignment**: Ensures everyone is working toward the same goals
- **Accountability**: Clear ownership and measurable results create accountability
- **Agility**: Quarterly cycles allow for course correction
- **Transparency**: Visible OKRs enable cross-team coordination

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too many OKRs**: Having more than 3-5 objectives dilutes focus
- **Key results that are tasks, not outcomes**: "Launch feature X" is a task; "Increase user engagement by 20%" is a key result
- **Setting OKRs in isolation**: OKRs should be discussed and aligned across teams
- **Treating OKRs as performance reviews**: OKRs are learning and alignment tools, not evaluation instruments
- **Never updating or reviewing**: OKRs lose value if they are not actively tracked

## Key Takeaway

OKRs connect daily work to strategic goals. By defining clear objectives and measurable key results, teams can ensure that their sprint-by-sprint delivery contributes to meaningful organizational outcomes. The framework is most effective when OKRs are ambitious, visible, regularly reviewed, and used for learning rather than punishment.
