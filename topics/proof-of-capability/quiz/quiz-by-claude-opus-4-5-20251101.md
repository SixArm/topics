  <p>To verify that a company or individual has the skills, resources, and capacity to deliver a product or service</p>
  <p>Proof of capability (POC) focuses on demonstrating that a company or individual has the necessary skills, expertise, resources, and capacity to complete a project or provide a service. Unlike proof of concept (which tests feasibility of new ideas), proof of capability verifies execution ability and is commonly used in procurement processes for government or large-scale commercial contracts to reduce the risk of selecting an unqualified vendor.</p>
