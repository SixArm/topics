  <p>Multiple nodes maintain synchronized copies without relying on a central authority</p>
  <p>A distributed ledger's defining characteristic is its decentralized architecture where multiple participating nodes each hold a copy of the entire ledger and work together to validate and agree on the state of the data through consensus mechanisms. This eliminates the need for a central authority to manage the database, providing benefits such as tamper-resistance, improved security, and transparency across all participants in the network.</p>
