  <p>Fixations and saccades</p>
  <p>Eye tracking hardware captures data about fixations (periods of stable gaze where the eye pauses on a specific area) and saccades (rapid eye movements between fixation points). These two fundamental measurements form the basis for understanding how users visually navigate and process information, enabling the creation of visualizations like heatmaps and gaze paths that inform UX design decisions.</p>
