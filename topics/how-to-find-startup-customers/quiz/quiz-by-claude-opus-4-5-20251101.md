  <p>Define your target market by identifying characteristics, demographics, and needs</p>
  <p>Defining your target market is the essential first step because it establishes who your ideal customers are through surveys, interviews, or analysis. Without this foundation, other customer acquisition strategies like advertising, events, or outreach will be unfocused and less effective. Understanding your target customers' characteristics and needs enables you to tailor all subsequent marketing and sales efforts appropriately.</p>
