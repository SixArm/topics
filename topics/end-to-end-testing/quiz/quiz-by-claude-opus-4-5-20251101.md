  <p>To verify the application functions correctly from beginning to end as a real user would experience it</p>
  <p>End-to-end testing is designed to test the complete functionality of an application from the user's perspective, simulating how a real user would interact with the system. It tests the user interface, all components and modules, and their integration to ensure the entire system works together as expected and meets user needs.</p>
