  <p>Create a job scorecard that outlines responsibilities, outcomes, and competencies</p>
  <p>The "A Method" emphasizes that the scorecard is the foundation for the entire hiring process. Before sourcing candidates or conducting interviews, organizations must first define what success looks like for the role by documenting the key responsibilities, expected outcomes, and required competencies. This scorecard then guides all subsequent steps—sourcing, selection, and selling—ensuring that hiring decisions are based on clear, objective criteria rather than gut feelings or unstructured evaluations.</p>
