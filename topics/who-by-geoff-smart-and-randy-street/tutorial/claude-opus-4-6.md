# "Who" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street

## Introduction

"Who: The A Method for Hiring" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street is one of the most influential books on talent acquisition for business leaders and technology professionals. Published in 2008, the book tackles what the authors argue is the single most important decision in business: who you hire. Drawing on extensive research involving over 1,300 hours of interviews with more than 20 billionaires, 60 CEOs, and 300 other executives, Smart and Street present a systematic, repeatable methodology called the "A Method" that replaces gut-feel hiring with a data-driven, structured process. For technology leaders managing engineering teams, product organizations, or startups, the principles in this book address one of the most persistent and costly challenges: hiring the right people consistently.

## The Core Problem: Hiring Failures

Smart and Street open with a stark observation: the average hiring success rate across industries hovers around 50%. This means that roughly half of all hiring decisions turn out to be mistakes. They call this phenomenon "voodoo hiring," where managers rely on intuition, unstructured interviews, and superficial assessments. The cost of a bad hire is substantial, often estimated at 15 times the employee's base salary when factoring in lost productivity, team disruption, recruitment costs, and opportunity costs.

The authors identify several common hiring pitfalls:

- **The Art Critic**: Managers who make snap judgments based on first impressions and gut feeling rather than evidence
- **The Sponge**: Hiring managers who absorb information passively during interviews without a structured evaluation framework
- **The Prosecutor**: Interviewers who use aggressive, trick questions that test composure rather than competence
- **The Suitor**: Managers so eager to fill a role that they sell the position rather than objectively evaluate candidates
- **The Trickster**: Interviewers who rely on brain teasers, riddles, or hypothetical scenarios with little predictive validity

## The A Method: Four Steps

The "A Method" is structured around four sequential phases, each building upon the previous one to create a rigorous and reliable hiring pipeline.

| Step | Purpose | Key Output |
|------|---------|------------|
| Scorecard | Define exactly what you need | A document specifying mission, outcomes, and competencies |
| Source | Build a pipeline of candidates | A systematic flow of A Players through multiple channels |
| Select | Evaluate candidates rigorously | Structured interview data scored against the scorecard |
| Sell | Close the top candidate | A compelling offer aligned to the candidate's motivations |

## Step 1: The Scorecard

The scorecard is the foundation of the entire A Method. Unlike a traditional job description, which tends to be a vague list of qualifications and responsibilities, the scorecard is a precise document that defines success for the role. It consists of three parts:

- **Mission**: A short, clear statement of the core purpose of the role. For a VP of Engineering, this might be "Scale the engineering organization from 20 to 80 engineers while maintaining release velocity and code quality."
- **Outcomes**: Three to eight specific, measurable results that the new hire must achieve, typically within their first 12 to 18 months. These are concrete and quantifiable, such as "Reduce average deployment time from 4 hours to 30 minutes" or "Achieve 99.95% uptime for production services."
- **Competencies**: The behavioral and cultural attributes required to achieve the outcomes. These include both role-specific competencies (such as technical architecture skills or people management) and cultural competencies (such as collaboration, bias toward action, or intellectual curiosity).

The scorecard forces hiring managers to think rigorously about what they actually need before they begin recruiting, which prevents the common trap of hiring someone impressive but misaligned to the role's true requirements.

## Step 2: Source

Smart and Street argue that most organizations do not invest enough effort in sourcing, relying too heavily on inbound applications and job postings. The authors recommend a proactive, always-on sourcing strategy built around three channels:

- **Referrals (50% of effort)**: The highest-quality candidates typically come through personal and professional networks. The authors recommend systematically asking every contact, "Who are the most talented people you know?" and building a pipeline continuously, not only when a role is open.
- **Recruiters (25% of effort)**: External recruiters and search firms can expand reach, but should be given the scorecard and held to the same standards as internal sourcing. The authors caution against relying solely on recruiters, as this creates dependency and reduces organizational hiring capability.
- **Direct sourcing and research (25% of effort)**: This includes identifying specific individuals at target companies, attending industry events, and leveraging online platforms to reach passive candidates who are not actively looking for new roles.

The key insight is that sourcing should be treated as a continuous business process rather than a reactive response to an open requisition.

## Step 3: Select

The selection phase is where the A Method diverges most sharply from conventional hiring practices. Instead of relying on a single unstructured interview, the authors prescribe a series of four structured interviews, each with a distinct purpose:

| Interview | Focus | Duration | Key Questions |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------------|
| Screening Interview | Quick assessment of fit | 30 minutes | Career goals, strengths, weaknesses, past manager ratings |
| Topgrading Interview | Chronological career walkthrough | 2-4 hours | Deep dive into every role: hired for what, accomplished what, left why, boss rating |
| Focused Interview | Scorecard-specific evaluation | 1 hour per interviewer | Behavioral questions mapped directly to each scorecard outcome and competency |
| Reference Interview | Verification and calibration | 30 minutes per reference | Candidate-arranged references asked structured, probing questions |

The **Topgrading Interview** is the centerpiece. It walks through a candidate's entire career history in chronological order, asking the same five questions about every position: What were you hired to do? What accomplishments are you most proud of? What were some low points? Who were the people you worked with (and what would they say about you)? Why did you leave? This method makes it extremely difficult for candidates to fabricate or embellish, because the pattern of answers must be internally consistent across a decade or more of roles.

The **Reference Interview** includes a critical innovation: candidates are asked to arrange reference calls with their former managers. This creates a "threat of reference check" dynamic during the Topgrading Interview, encouraging honesty throughout the process.

## Step 4: Sell

Once a top candidate is identified, the final step is to close the deal. Smart and Street organize the sell around five key motivations, which they call the "Five F's of Selling":

- **Fit**: Show the candidate how their skills, goals, and values align with the role and organization
- **Family**: Address any concerns the candidate's family may have about relocation, work-life balance, or lifestyle changes
- **Freedom**: Clarify the level of autonomy and decision-making authority the role provides
- **Fortune**: Present competitive compensation, equity, and financial incentives
- **Fun**: Convey the culture, team dynamics, and the intrinsic interest of the work itself

The authors stress that selling is not manipulation. It is about genuinely understanding what matters to the candidate and demonstrating how the opportunity meets those needs. The best time to sell is throughout the process, not only at the offer stage.

## Applying the A Method in Technology Organizations

For technology professionals and engineering leaders, the A Method has particular relevance in several areas:

- **Technical scorecards**: Engineering roles benefit greatly from specific, measurable outcomes rather than vague requirements like "strong coding skills." Outcomes such as "Architect and deploy a microservices migration for the payments system within Q3" are far more useful for evaluation.
- **Sourcing in competitive markets**: The technology talent market is highly competitive. The emphasis on referrals and continuous sourcing is especially valuable when hiring for senior engineers, staff engineers, and engineering managers who are rarely active job seekers.
- **Structured technical interviews**: The A Method complements technical assessments by providing the behavioral and career-history dimension that coding challenges alone cannot capture. Combining a Topgrading Interview with a well-designed system design or pair programming session produces a more complete picture.
- **Reducing bias**: The structured, scorecard-driven approach reduces the influence of unconscious bias by anchoring every evaluation to predefined criteria rather than subjective impressions.

## Common Criticisms and Limitations

While widely praised, the A Method is not without criticism:

- **Time investment**: The Topgrading Interview alone can take two to four hours, which may be impractical for high-volume hiring or organizations with limited interviewer bandwidth.
- **Candidate experience**: Lengthy, multi-round processes can deter in-demand candidates, particularly in technology markets where top talent often has multiple competing offers.
- **Cultural assumptions**: The methodology assumes a relatively traditional employer-employee relationship and may need adaptation for contract work, freelance arrangements, or distributed teams.
- **Reference reliability**: While the threat of reference checks improves honesty, former managers may still provide guarded or overly positive references due to legal and social pressures.

Despite these limitations, the core principles of defining success criteria before sourcing, using structured interviews, and verifying claims through references remain highly effective.

## Summary

"Who: The A Method for Hiring" provides a disciplined, evidence-based framework for one of the most consequential decisions any leader makes. By replacing intuition with structure through four clear steps, the Scorecard, Source, Select, and Sell methodology, Smart and Street give technology leaders a repeatable system for identifying and securing top talent. The book's lasting contribution is its insistence that hiring is not an art but a process, one that can be learned, measured, and improved over time, ultimately transforming organizational performance by ensuring the right people are in the right roles.
