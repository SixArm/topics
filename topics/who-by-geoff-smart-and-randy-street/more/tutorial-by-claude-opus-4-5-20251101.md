## "Who" by Geoff Smart and Randy Street: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

## Overview

"Who: The A Method for Hiring" is a practical guide that addresses one of the most critical challenges facing technology leaders: hiring the right people. Written by Geoff Smart and Randy Street, the book presents a systematic, data-driven approach to talent acquisition that reduces hiring mistakes and increases the probability of landing top performers.

For technology professionals—whether you're a CTO building an engineering team, a startup founder making your first hires, or a tech lead expanding your squad—the principles in this book translate directly to improved team performance and reduced costly mis-hires.

## Why Hiring Matters in Technology

The stakes of hiring decisions in technology are exceptionally high. A wrong hire can derail a product roadmap, introduce technical debt, damage team morale, and cost the organization significantly in both direct compensation and opportunity costs. Research suggests that a bad hire can cost 15-27 times the person's base salary when factoring in lost productivity, team disruption, and rehiring costs.

The "A Method" provides a structured framework to minimize these risks systematically rather than relying on gut instinct or unstructured interviews.

## The A Method: Four Core Steps

The methodology breaks hiring into four distinct phases, each with specific techniques and deliverables.

| Step | Purpose | Key Deliverable |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Scorecard | Define what success looks like | Written job scorecard with mission, outcomes, and competencies |
| Source | Build a pipeline of candidates | Diverse candidate pool from multiple channels |
| Select | Evaluate candidates rigorously | Structured interview data aligned to scorecard |
| Sell | Close the best candidate | Accepted offer from top choice |

## Step 1: The Scorecard

The scorecard is the foundation of the entire hiring process. Unlike traditional job descriptions that list tasks and qualifications, a scorecard defines what the person must accomplish and how they should operate.

### Components of an Effective Scorecard

**Mission Statement**: A brief description of why the role exists. For a Staff Engineer, this might be: "Lead the technical architecture of our payment processing system, ensuring reliability, scalability, and security while mentoring junior engineers."

**Outcomes**: Specific, measurable results the hire must achieve within defined timeframes. These should be concrete and verifiable:

- Reduce API latency by 40% within six months
- Ship the v2.0 release on schedule with fewer than 5 critical bugs
- Establish CI/CD pipeline achieving 99% deployment success rate

**Competencies**: The behaviors and skills required to achieve the outcomes. These include both technical competencies (system design, language proficiency) and behavioral competencies (collaboration, communication, problem-solving).

### Scorecard Benefits for Technology Hiring

| Traditional Job Description | Scorecard Approach |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Lists responsibilities and qualifications | Defines measurable outcomes |
| Vague success criteria | Clear performance benchmarks |
| Focuses on inputs (what they'll do) | Focuses on outputs (what they'll achieve) |
| Difficult to evaluate candidates against | Direct comparison framework |

## Step 2: Source

Sourcing is about building a robust pipeline of qualified candidates before you need to fill a position. The authors recommend the "50/25/25" allocation:

- **50% Referrals**: Ask your top performers, "Who are the best engineers you've worked with?" Network referrals consistently yield higher-quality candidates who are pre-vetted by people you trust.

- **25% Job Postings**: Post on relevant platforms (LinkedIn, specialized tech job boards, company career page), but treat these as one channel among many rather than the primary source.

- **25% Direct Sourcing**: Actively identify and reach out to passive candidates through professional networks, open source contributions, conference speakers, and industry connections.

### Building a Sourcing Engine

Effective sourcing requires ongoing effort, not just reactive posting when a position opens:

- Maintain relationships with strong candidates even when not hiring
- Track promising engineers you encounter at conferences and meetups
- Create internal referral incentives that reward quality, not just quantity
- Develop a reputation as an employer of choice through technical blog posts, open source contributions, and speaking engagements

## Step 3: Select

The selection phase uses structured interviews to evaluate candidates against the scorecard. The authors recommend four specific interview types:

### The Four Interview Types

| Interview | Purpose | Duration | Key Questions |
|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Screening Interview | Quick filter for basic fit | 30 minutes | "What are you looking for in your next role?" |
| Topgrading Interview | Deep chronological review | 3-4 hours | Walk through entire career history |
| Focused Interview | Evaluate specific outcomes/competencies | 45-60 minutes | Targeted questions on scorecard items |
| Reference Interview | Validate claims and uncover concerns | 30 minutes | "What were their biggest accomplishments?" |

### The Topgrading Interview

This is the distinctive element of the A Method. Rather than asking hypothetical questions, you walk chronologically through the candidate's career, asking consistent questions at each stop:

- What were you hired to do?
- What accomplishments are you most proud of?
- What were some low points or failures?
- Who was your boss, and what would they say about your performance?
- Why did you leave?

The chronological approach reveals patterns in behavior, performance, and growth. For technology candidates, this surfaces how they've handled technical challenges, team dynamics, and career decisions over time.

### Avoiding Common Interview Mistakes

The authors identify several pitfalls that undermine hiring decisions:

- **The Art Critic**: Making snap judgments based on first impressions
- **The Sponge**: Absorbing information without structured evaluation
- **The Prosecutor**: Aggressively grilling candidates rather than building rapport
- **The Suitor**: Overselling the role without evaluating the candidate
- **The Trickster**: Using brainteasers or trick questions that don't predict performance

For technology roles specifically, avoid over-indexing on whiteboard coding puzzles that test performance under artificial pressure rather than actual engineering capability.

## Step 4: Sell

Once you've identified your top candidate, the final step is closing them. The authors recommend addressing five key areas—the "Five Fs":

| Factor | What to Address |
|--------|-----------------|
| Fit | How the role aligns with their career goals and interests |
| Family | How the job accommodates personal and family needs |
| Freedom | The autonomy and flexibility they'll have |
| Fortune | Compensation, equity, and financial upside |
| Fun | The culture, team, and nature of the work itself |

For technology candidates, the "Fun" and "Freedom" factors often carry significant weight. Engineers want to work on interesting problems with capable colleagues using modern tools and practices.

### Overcoming Objections

Strong candidates often have multiple offers. Address objections directly:

- If they're concerned about technology stack, demonstrate openness to evolution
- If they want remote flexibility, be clear about policies and expectations
- If compensation is the barrier, understand their total package needs before negotiating

## Applying the A Method in Technology Organizations

### Adapting for Technical Roles

The A Method works particularly well for technology hiring, but requires some adaptation:

**Scorecard Specifics**: Include both technical outcomes (system performance, code quality metrics) and business outcomes (revenue impact, user adoption). Competencies should cover both technical skills and collaborative behaviors.

**Technical Assessment Integration**: While the A Method doesn't prescribe technical evaluations, you can incorporate take-home projects or pair programming sessions as part of the Focused Interview phase. Ensure these exercises map directly to scorecard competencies.

**Calibration with Engineering Leadership**: Have multiple technical leaders conduct Focused Interviews evaluating different competencies, then calibrate together before making decisions.

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create scorecards for each open role before sourcing begins
- [ ] Train hiring managers and interviewers on the four interview types
- [ ] Establish a referral program with meaningful incentives
- [ ] Build interview guides with questions mapped to scorecard competencies
- [ ] Implement structured debrief sessions after interviews
- [ ] Track hiring metrics (time-to-fill, source effectiveness, new hire performance)

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

| Mistake | Consequence | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Skipping the scorecard | Misaligned expectations, unclear evaluation criteria | Never open a role without a completed scorecard |
| Over-relying on job postings | Limited candidate pool, missing passive candidates | Implement the 50/25/25 sourcing mix |
| Unstructured interviews | Bias, inconsistent evaluation, poor predictions | Use the four interview types consistently |
| Rushing the process | Settling for available rather than best candidates | Build pipeline before urgent need arises |
| Ignoring red flags | Costly mis-hires, team disruption | Trust the process and reference checks |

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to evaluate your hiring effectiveness:

- **Quality of Hire**: Performance ratings of new hires at 6 and 12 months
- **Source Effectiveness**: Conversion rates and quality by sourcing channel
- **Interview Accuracy**: Correlation between interview ratings and job performance
- **Time-to-Productivity**: How quickly new hires reach full effectiveness
- **Retention Rate**: Percentage of hires remaining after one and two years

## Key Takeaways

The A Method provides a repeatable, evidence-based approach to hiring that reduces the guesswork and bias inherent in traditional processes. For technology professionals, the key lessons are:

- **Define success before you search**: The scorecard forces clarity about what you actually need
- **Diversify your sources**: Top candidates rarely come from job postings alone
- **Structure your evaluation**: Chronological interviews reveal patterns that predict future performance
- **Close with intention**: Understanding candidate motivations enables effective selling

Hiring is a skill that improves with deliberate practice. The A Method provides the framework; consistent application builds the capability to assemble exceptional technology teams.
