  <p>Membership values are shared principles, beliefs, and expectations that guide behavior and interactions within a group. They help create a sense of identity, belonging, and purpose among members. These values—such as respect, trust, integrity, inclusivity, and collaboration—provide a foundation for decision-making and conflict resolution while fostering community and shared purpose.</p>
