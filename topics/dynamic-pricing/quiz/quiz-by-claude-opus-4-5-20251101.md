  <p>To maximize revenue and profit by charging the optimal price for each unit sold</p>
  <p>Dynamic pricing continuously adjusts prices based on real-time market demand, competition, seasonality, and other external factors. The core objective is revenue optimization—ensuring each transaction captures the maximum value the market will bear at that moment, rather than leaving money on the table with static pricing or racing to the bottom with competitor-matching.</p>
