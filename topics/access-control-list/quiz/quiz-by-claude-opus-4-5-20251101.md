# Access Control List (ACL)

Question: What is the fundamental difference between standard ACLs and extended ACLs?

- [ ] Standard ACLs are used only for files, while extended ACLs are used only for network traffic
- [ ] Standard ACLs filter based on source IP address only, while extended ACLs can filter based on source IP, destination IP, protocol, and port number
- [ ] Standard ACLs are managed by system administrators, while extended ACLs are managed by end users
- [ ] Standard ACLs provide read-only access, while extended ACLs provide read-write access

  <p>Standard ACLs filter based on source IP address only, while extended ACLs can filter based on source IP, destination IP, protocol, and port number</p>
  <p>Standard ACLs are limited to controlling access based solely on the source IP address, making them simpler but less precise. Extended ACLs provide more granular control by allowing filtering based on multiple criteria including source IP address, destination IP address, protocol type, and port numbers. This distinction is critical for network security professionals because extended ACLs enable more sophisticated traffic filtering rules on firewalls and routers.</p>
