  <p>Missionaries are inspired by a shared vision while mercenaries merely execute tasks</p>
  <p>Cagan emphasizes that the best product teams are composed of "missionaries"—people who are genuinely inspired by and believe in the product vision—rather than "mercenaries" who simply complete assigned work without deeper engagement. This distinction is fundamental to building products customers love because missionaries bring passion, creativity, and ownership to solving customer problems.</p>
