# Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love

"Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love" by Marty Cagan is a guide for product management in tech, centering on how companies like Amazon, Google, and Netflix consistently build products customers love. 

**Product vs. Project Mindset:** Emphasize outcomes over outputs. Teams should
avoid linear, project-style development and instead continuously test and
validate ideas through discovery and iteration.

**Continuous Discovery:**  Test assumptions about value, usability, feasibility,
and business viability early through prototypes and user testing. Prototype-only
deliverables are purpose-built to validate risk—not to be feature-complete
products.

**Missionaries > Mercenaries:** Teams should be made of “missionaries”—people
inspired by a shared vision—not “mercenaries” merely executing tasks.
Cross-functional collaboration (PM, design, engineering) in all phases—including
discovery—is essential.

**Vision & Strategy:** Vision should be inspiring, customer-centered, and
aligned to long-term trends and business needs. Strategy should focus on one key
persona or market at a time and sync with organizational goals. 

**People & Culture:** Build empowered, cross-skilled teams with T-shaped skills.
Foster a culture of autonomy, high ownership, and relentless innovation tied to
customer problems. Organizational culture is what sustains long-term change.

**Data & Feedback:** Make being customer-first not a slogan, but a habit.
Combine qualitative interviews, usability testing, and quantitative metrics
(engagement, retention, business outcomes) to guide decisions.
