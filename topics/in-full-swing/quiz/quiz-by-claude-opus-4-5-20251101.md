  <p>When a project is "in full swing," it means it is fully underway and operating at its peak or most active state. All necessary elements are established, team members are fully engaged, and work is progressing at maximum productivity. This idiom indicates the project has moved past initial setup and is in its most vibrant, effective execution phase.</p>
