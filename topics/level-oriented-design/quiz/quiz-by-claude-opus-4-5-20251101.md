# Level-Oriented Design (LOD)

Question: What is the primary organizing principle of Level-Oriented Design (LOD) in software architecture?

- [ ] Organizing code around individual programming languages and their specific features
- [ ] Structuring systems around horizontal time-based development phases
- [ ] Arranging architecture hierarchically around levels of abstraction
- [ ] Grouping components by the team members responsible for them

  <p>Arranging architecture hierarchically around levels of abstraction</p>
  <p>Level-Oriented Design (LOD) is a software design approach that organizes system architecture around hierarchical levels of abstraction. Each level corresponds to specific design goals and concerns—from low-level implementation details (programming languages, algorithms, data structures) to high-level architecture (functionality, performance, user interface). This hierarchical organization helps manage system complexity and promotes modularity and component reuse.</p>
