  <p>The indicator will be subject to corruption pressures and distort the processes it was intended to monitor</p>
  <p>Campbell's Law states: "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor." For technology professionals, this is critical when designing KPIs, metrics dashboards, or performance measurements—once people know they're being measured by a specific metric, they optimize for that metric, often at the expense of the underlying goal it was meant to represent.</p>
