  <p>Equity crowdfunding offers ownership shares in a company, while reward-based provides products or services</p>
  <p>In equity crowdfunding, supporters invest money in a start-up or early-stage company in exchange for shares (ownership stake) in the company. In contrast, reward-based crowdfunding provides supporters with a product, service, or some other form of tangible reward in exchange for their contribution. This distinction is critical for technology professionals evaluating funding strategies, as equity crowdfunding involves giving up company ownership while reward-based crowdfunding allows founders to retain full control.</p>
