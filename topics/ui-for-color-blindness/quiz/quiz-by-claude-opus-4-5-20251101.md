# UI for color blindness

Question: What is the most important principle for designing user interfaces accessible to individuals with color blindness?

- [ ] Use only red and green colors since they are universally visible
- [ ] Rely primarily on color coding for faster information processing
- [ ] Do not convey critical information solely through color; use additional visual cues like icons, labels, shapes, or patterns
- [ ] Limit the color palette to grayscale only

  <p>Do not convey critical information solely through color; use additional visual cues like icons, labels, shapes, or patterns</p>
  <p>This is the foundational principle of color-blind accessible design. Since individuals with color blindness cannot reliably distinguish certain colors, relying on color alone to convey meaning (such as error states, status indicators, or required fields) will exclude them from understanding critical information. By supplementing color with icons, text labels, patterns, or shapes, the information remains accessible regardless of a user's color perception abilities.</p>
