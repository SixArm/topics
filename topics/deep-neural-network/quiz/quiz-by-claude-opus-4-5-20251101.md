# Deep neural network

Question: What distinguishes a deep neural network (DNN) from a shallow neural network?

- [ ] DNNs use only linear activation functions throughout all layers
- [ ] DNNs require manual feature engineering before training
- [ ] DNNs have multiple hidden layers that enable learning hierarchical representations
- [ ] DNNs can only process image data through convolutional operations

  <p>DNNs have multiple hidden layers that enable learning hierarchical representations</p>
  <p>The defining characteristic of deep neural networks is their depth—they contain multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers, unlike shallow networks with just one or two hidden layers. This depth allows DNNs to learn hierarchical representations where lower layers capture simple features and higher layers learn increasingly abstract and complex patterns from the data.</p>
