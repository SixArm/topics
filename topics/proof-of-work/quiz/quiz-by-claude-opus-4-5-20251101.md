# Proof-of-work (PoW)

Question: What is the primary security guarantee that makes proof-of-work resistant to attacks on a blockchain network?

- [ ] Transactions are encrypted using public key cryptography
- [ ] An attacker would need to control over 50% of the network's computing power to compromise it
- [ ] All miners must agree unanimously before a block is added
- [ ] The blockchain automatically rejects any transaction over a certain size

  <p>An attacker would need to control over 50% of the network's computing power to compromise it</p>
  <p>Proof-of-work requires significant computational power to solve cryptographic puzzles, making it resistant to attacks. To successfully attack the network (known as a 51% attack), an attacker would need to control a majority of the network's total computing power, which is prohibitively expensive and difficult to achieve on established networks like Bitcoin.</p>
