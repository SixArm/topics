Question: According to SAFe Principle 3, what is the recommended approach to design and requirements decisions in agile development?

- [ ] Choose the most cost-effective option as early as possible to reduce project expenses
- [ ] Maintain multiple requirements and design options longer, then use empirical data to narrow focus
- [ ] Delegate all design decisions to a single architect to ensure consistency
- [ ] Lock in requirements at the start of each sprint to maintain team velocity

  <p>Maintain multiple requirements and design options longer, then use empirical data to narrow focus</p>
  <p>SAFe Principle 3 advises against choosing a single design-and-requirements option early in development, as wrong choices lead to costly adjustments and suboptimal designs. Instead, teams should preserve multiple options for longer and use empirical data to make informed decisions, resulting in optimum economic outcomes.</p>
