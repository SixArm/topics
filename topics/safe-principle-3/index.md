# Assume variability; preserve options

"Assume variability; preserve options" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 3.

Traditional design and life cycle practices encourage choosing a single
design-and-requirements option early in the development process. Unfortunately,
if that starting point proves to be the wrong choice, then future adjustments
take too long and can lead to a suboptimal design. A better approach is to
maintain multiple requirements and design options for a longer period in the
development cycle. Empirical data is then used to narrow the focus, resulting in
a design that creates optimum economic outcomes.
