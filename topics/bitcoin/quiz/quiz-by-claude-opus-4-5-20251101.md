  <p>21 million</p>
  <p>Bitcoin has a hard-coded supply cap of 21 million coins, which is fundamental to its design as a deflationary digital currency. This scarcity is enforced by the Bitcoin protocol and distinguishes it from traditional fiat currencies that can be printed without limit. New bitcoins are created through mining, but the reward halves approximately every four years, ensuring the total supply approaches but never exceeds 21 million.</p>
