# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Question: What is the primary purpose of pooling layers in a Convolutional Neural Network?

- [ ] To introduce non-linearity into the network
- [ ] To make final predictions based on extracted features
- [ ] To downsample feature maps and reduce spatial dimensions
- [ ] To detect different patterns using sliding filters

  <p>To downsample feature maps and reduce spatial dimensions</p>
  <p>Pooling layers downsample the feature maps produced by convolutional layers, reducing the spatial dimensions while extracting the most relevant information. This helps decrease computational requirements and enables the network to recognize patterns regardless of their exact position in the input image.</p>
