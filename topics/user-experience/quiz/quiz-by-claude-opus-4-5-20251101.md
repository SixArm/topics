  <p>Understanding users' needs, behaviors, and emotions to deliver intuitive and meaningful experiences</p>
  <p>UX design centers on understanding users holistically—their goals, preferences, pain points, and emotions—to create products and services that are enjoyable, intuitive, and meaningful. While visual design is one component of UX, the discipline encompasses much broader concerns including user research, information architecture, usability, interaction design, accessibility, and continuous iteration based on user feedback.</p>
