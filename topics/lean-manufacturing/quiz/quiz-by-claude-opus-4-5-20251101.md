  <p>Maximizing value for customers while minimizing waste</p>
  <p>Lean manufacturing is fundamentally a production philosophy aimed at maximizing value from the customer's perspective while systematically eliminating waste (Muda) and inefficiencies. This is achieved through practices like just-in-time pull systems, continuous improvement (Kaizen), value stream mapping, and optimizing flow—all centered on delivering what customers actually want without excess inventory, overproduction, or non-value-adding activities.</p>
