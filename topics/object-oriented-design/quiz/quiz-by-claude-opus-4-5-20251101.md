# Object-oriented design (OOD)

Question: What are the three key principles of object-oriented design?

- [ ] Abstraction, modularity, and coupling
- [ ] Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- [ ] Composition, aggregation, and association
- [ ] Cohesion, decoupling, and separation of concerns

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism</p>
  <p>These three principles form the foundation of object-oriented design. Encapsulation hides an object's internal state and exposes only necessary information through well-defined interfaces. Inheritance allows new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes, enabling code reuse. Polymorphism enables objects to take on multiple forms, allowing different objects to respond differently to the same method call.</p>
