  <p>The buyer reimburses the seller for actual costs plus a profit margin</p>
  <p>A cost-plus contract is specifically designed so that the buyer agrees to reimburse the seller for all costs incurred in production or service delivery, plus a predetermined profit margin. This structure is used when actual costs cannot be accurately estimated in advance, giving buyers flexibility to monitor progress while providing sellers with predictable revenue and reduced risk of underestimating project costs.</p>
