  <p>Dialogic OD emphasizes dialogue, participation, and collaboration among stakeholders rather than expert-driven top-down interventions</p>
  <p>Dialogic OD is an approach to organizational change that prioritizes multiple perspectives, social constructionism, and generative conversations. It views change as a continuous, emergent process that is co-created by organizational members, contrasting with traditional OD approaches that rely on expert-driven top-down interventions. This collaborative approach aims to build adaptive and resilient organizations capable of navigating complexity and uncertainty.</p>
