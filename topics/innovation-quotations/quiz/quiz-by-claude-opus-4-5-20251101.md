  <p>Creativity is thinking up new things while innovation is doing new things</p>
  <p>Theodore Levitt's quotation emphasizes that creativity and innovation are related but distinct concepts. Creativity is the ideation phase—generating new ideas and concepts. Innovation, however, is about execution—turning those ideas into tangible outcomes, products, or processes. This distinction is critical for technology professionals because it highlights that having great ideas is insufficient; the real value comes from implementing them effectively in the real world.</p>
