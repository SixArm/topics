  <p>A false positive occurs when a model or test incorrectly predicts the positive class. In medical screening, this means the test indicates the presence of a condition (positive result) when the patient does not actually have it. This is distinct from a false negative (missing an actual condition) and from true positives and true negatives (correct predictions).</p>
