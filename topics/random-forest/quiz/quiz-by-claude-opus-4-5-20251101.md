# Random Forest

Question: What technique does Random Forest use to introduce diversity among its decision trees during construction?

- [ ] Using all available features at each node split
- [ ] Applying gradient boosting to sequentially correct errors
- [ ] Considering only a random subset of features at each node split
- [ ] Training each tree on the complete original dataset

  <p>Considering only a random subset of features at each node split</p>
  <p>Random Forest introduces randomness and diversity among trees by considering only a random subset of features for splitting at each node, rather than using all features. Combined with bootstrapped sampling of the training data, this technique helps reduce overfitting and improves the model's generalization capability.</p>
