  <p>Implementing practices without understanding their underlying principles or purpose</p>
  <p>Cargo cult in software engineering refers to the superficial adoption of practices, terminology, tools, or ceremonies without understanding why they exist or making the fundamental mindset shifts required for them to be effective. Teams follow prescribed rituals but miss the reasoning behind them, leading to frustration, failed deliveries, and experiencing the overhead of practices without their benefits.</p>
