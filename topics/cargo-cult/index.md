# Cargo cult

Cargo cult refers to the superficial adoption of practices without understanding
their underlying principles or purpose. The term draws from post-World War II
Pacific Islander cargo cults, where communities mimicked the behaviors they
observed from military personnel, believing these rituals would bring back the
material goods they had seen during wartime.

In software engineering, cargo cult manifests when organizations implement
terminology while missing the fundamental mindset shift required for the work.
Teams follow the prescribed rituals but without understanding the reasons why.

This superficial implementation often occurs due to pressure from management to
"get things done" quickly, lack of proper training, or resistance to the
cultural changes that genuine transformation requires. Organizations may adopt
tools or hold ceremonies while maintaining rigid hierarchies, avoiding feedback,
or continuing to work in isolation.

The consequences of cargo cult include team frustration, failed deliveries, and
disillusionment. Teams experience the overhead of practices without the
benefits.

Avoiding cargo cult requires focusing on the principles behind the practices,
investing in proper education and coaching, and gradually building a mindset
rather than simply implementing processes. Success comes from understanding why
practices exist and adapting them meaningfully to the specific context rather
than blindly following prescribed formulas.
