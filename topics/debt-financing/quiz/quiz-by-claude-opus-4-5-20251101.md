  <p>Debt financing involves borrowed funds that must be repaid with interest</p>
  <p>Debt financing is a method where startups borrow funds from an investor or lender, which must be paid back over time with interest. This is fundamentally different from equity financing, where investors receive ownership stakes in the company. Common forms of debt financing include traditional loans, lines of credit, and convertible notes. While debt financing can provide relatively low-cost capital for startups with clear revenue paths, it carries the risk of default and requires managing interest payments and principal repayments that can impact cash flow.</p>
