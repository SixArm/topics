# Debt financing

Debt financing is a method of raising capital in which an organization borrows funds from a lender or investor, with the obligation to repay the principal plus interest over a defined period. Unlike equity financing, debt financing does not require surrendering ownership or control of the company. For technology professionals, understanding debt financing is essential because it influences how startups fund product development, how enterprises finance infrastructure, and how capital structure decisions affect long-term business viability.

## How debt financing works

Debt financing establishes a contractual relationship between a borrower and a lender. The borrower receives a lump sum or access to a credit facility and agrees to repay the amount according to a schedule, typically with interest. The lender earns a return through interest payments rather than through ownership in the company. If the borrower defaults, the lender may have recourse to collateral or other legal remedies.

The cost of debt financing depends on several factors: the borrower's creditworthiness, prevailing interest rates, the loan term, and whether the debt is secured or unsecured. Secured debt is backed by specific assets such as equipment or intellectual property, which reduces risk for the lender and typically results in lower interest rates. Unsecured debt carries no collateral requirement but commands higher rates to compensate for the increased risk.

## Common forms of debt financing

Debt financing comes in various forms, each suited to different stages of a company's lifecycle and different capital needs.

- **Traditional term loans**: The borrower receives a fixed sum and repays it with interest over a set period, usually in monthly installments. Banks and credit unions are the primary sources. These work best for companies with established revenue and credit history.

- **Lines of credit**: A revolving facility that provides access to a pool of funds the borrower can draw upon as needed. Interest accrues only on the amount actually borrowed. This is useful for managing working capital and smoothing cash flow fluctuations.

- **Convertible notes**: A hybrid instrument commonly used in early-stage startup financing. The investor provides a loan that can convert into equity at a future financing round, typically at a discount. This defers the need to establish a company valuation.

- **Revenue-based financing**: Repayment is tied to a percentage of the company's monthly revenue rather than fixed installments. This aligns repayment with the company's ability to pay and is popular among SaaS companies with predictable recurring revenue.

- **Venture debt**: A form of debt financing available to venture-backed startups, often provided alongside or shortly after an equity round. It extends a company's runway without additional dilution and is typically structured with warrants that give the lender a small equity stake.

- **Equipment financing**: Loans or leases specifically for purchasing hardware, servers, or other physical assets. The equipment itself serves as collateral, making this accessible even for younger companies.

## Debt financing versus equity financing

| Factor | Debt financing | Equity financing |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership | No dilution; founders retain full ownership | Investors receive ownership shares |
| Repayment | Principal and interest must be repaid on schedule | No repayment obligation |
| Cost | Interest payments, which are often tax-deductible | Share of future profits and capital appreciation |
| Control | Lender has no board seat or voting rights | Investors may require board seats and governance rights |
| Risk | Default can trigger legal consequences and damage credit | No default risk, but misaligned interests can create conflict |
| Availability | Requires creditworthiness or collateral | Requires a compelling growth story and market opportunity |
| Best suited for | Companies with predictable revenue and cash flow | High-growth companies that need capital before generating revenue |

## Advantages of debt financing

- **No ownership dilution**: Founders and existing shareholders retain their equity stake and control over strategic decisions.

- **Tax benefits**: Interest payments on debt are typically tax-deductible, reducing the effective cost of borrowing.

- **Predictable cost structure**: Fixed interest rates and repayment schedules allow for precise financial planning and budgeting.

- **Speed of access**: Debt instruments, especially lines of credit and venture debt, can often be arranged faster than equity rounds.

- **Relationship simplicity**: The lender-borrower relationship is transactional and governed by clear contractual terms, unlike the ongoing governance complexities of equity investors.

## Risks and challenges

- **Repayment obligation**: Regardless of business performance, debt must be repaid on schedule. This creates a fixed cash outflow that can strain early-stage or rapidly scaling companies.

- **Cash flow pressure**: Interest payments and principal repayments consume operating cash flow, reducing the capital available for growth investments.

- **Default consequences**: Failure to meet repayment obligations can result in asset seizure, damaged credit ratings, personal liability if guarantees are involved, and difficulty securing future financing.

- **Covenants and restrictions**: Lenders often impose financial covenants such as minimum revenue thresholds, debt-to-equity ratios, or restrictions on additional borrowing, which can limit operational flexibility.

- **Collateral requirements**: Secured debt requires pledging assets, which may not be available for technology companies whose primary value lies in intellectual property and human capital rather than physical assets.

## When to use debt financing

Debt financing is most appropriate under specific conditions. Companies with a clear path to revenue and predictable cash flow are well-positioned to service debt. It is effective for financing discrete projects with quantifiable returns, such as purchasing equipment, funding a product launch, or bridging the gap between financing rounds.

Technology companies commonly use venture debt to extend their runway by six to twelve months after raising an equity round. This strategy reduces dilution while giving the company more time to hit milestones that justify a higher valuation at the next equity raise. SaaS companies with strong monthly recurring revenue often find revenue-based financing attractive because repayment scales naturally with business performance.

Debt financing is less appropriate for pre-revenue startups, companies in highly uncertain markets, or businesses that cannot demonstrate the ability to generate consistent cash flow to service the debt.

Technology professionals exploring debt financing should also study equity financing and convertible notes to understand the full spectrum of capital-raising options. Familiarity with capitalization tables, valuation methods such as discounted cash flow, and financial ratios will strengthen the ability to evaluate financing decisions. Understanding venture capital mechanics, term sheets, and liquidation preferences provides context for how debt and equity instruments interact in a company's capital structure.

## Summary

Debt financing enables companies to raise capital without surrendering ownership by borrowing funds that must be repaid with interest over time. It comes in many forms, from traditional bank loans to venture debt and revenue-based financing, each suited to different business stages and capital needs. While debt financing offers advantages including retained ownership, tax-deductible interest, and predictable costs, it carries real risks around repayment obligations, cash flow strain, and default consequences. For technology companies, the decision to use debt financing hinges on having sufficient revenue predictability and cash flow to service the debt, making it a powerful tool when deployed at the right stage and under the right conditions.
