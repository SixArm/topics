  <p>Problems compound over time, decreasing morale and productivity</p>
  <p>Without dedicated reflection sessions like retrospectives, teams cannot systematically address systemic issues, process bottlenecks, and interpersonal conflicts. This causes problems to accumulate rather than be resolved, leading to decreased morale and reduced productivity. While daily standups and showcases serve important purposes, they do not provide the dedicated space for process improvement that retrospectives offer.</p>
