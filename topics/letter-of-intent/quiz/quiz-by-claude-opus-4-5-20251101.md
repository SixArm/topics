  <p>A letter of intent is typically non-binding, meaning it does not create a legally enforceable agreement. Instead, it outlines preliminary understanding between parties and serves as a sign of good faith and commitment, useful for negotiating a binding agreement in the future. This is crucial for technology professionals to understand when entering negotiations for partnerships, acquisitions, or other business arrangements.</p>
