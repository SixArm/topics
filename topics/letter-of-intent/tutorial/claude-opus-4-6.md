# Letter Of Intent (LOI)

A letter of intent (LOI), also known as a memorandum of understanding (MOU), is a document that outlines the preliminary understanding between two or more parties regarding a potential transaction or agreement. In the technology industry, LOIs are frequently used during mergers and acquisitions, partnership negotiations, licensing deals, and vendor engagements. While typically non-binding, an LOI establishes a framework of mutual expectations and signals good faith commitment before parties invest significant time and resources into drafting definitive legal agreements.

## Purpose and Function

A letter of intent serves as a roadmap for negotiations. It captures the essential terms that parties have tentatively agreed upon, allowing both sides to confirm alignment before proceeding to costly due diligence and formal contract drafting. For technology professionals, this is particularly important in scenarios such as acquiring a startup, negotiating an enterprise software license, or forming a joint development partnership.

The LOI reduces ambiguity early in the process. By putting preliminary terms in writing, parties can identify potential deal-breakers before committing legal fees and engineering resources. It also provides a reference point that keeps negotiations on track and prevents scope creep during the transition from informal discussions to binding contracts.

## Typical Provisions

A well-drafted LOI addresses several key areas:

- **Parties involved**: The legal names, addresses, and contact information of all entities entering the potential agreement. In technology deals, this may include parent companies, subsidiaries, or special purpose vehicles.
- **Description of the transaction**: The nature of the deal, whether it is an acquisition, licensing arrangement, partnership, or service engagement. This section defines the product, service, or asset under consideration and outlines the general scope.
- **Financial terms**: The proposed purchase price, payment structure, milestone-based payments, equity considerations, or royalty arrangements. For technology transactions, this often includes valuation methodology and earn-out provisions.
- **Timelines**: Key dates including the exclusivity period, due diligence window, expected closing date, and any milestone deadlines.
- **Confidentiality**: Obligations around the protection of proprietary information, trade secrets, source code, and other sensitive data exchanged during negotiations. This provision is often binding even when the rest of the LOI is not.
- **Exclusivity (no-shop clause)**: A commitment that one or both parties will not negotiate with competing parties for a defined period.
- **Due diligence requirements**: The scope and timeline for technical, financial, and legal review activities.
- **Governing law**: The jurisdiction whose laws will govern the interpretation and enforcement of the LOI.
- **Termination conditions**: Circumstances under which either party may walk away from the negotiations without liability.

## Binding vs. Non-Binding Elements

One of the most critical distinctions in any LOI is which provisions are binding and which are not. Most LOIs are structured as predominantly non-binding, but certain clauses carry legal weight.

| Element | Typically Binding | Typically Non-Binding |
|---|---|---|
| Confidentiality | Yes | |
| Exclusivity / No-shop | Yes | |
| Governing law | Yes | |
| Purchase price | | Yes |
| Transaction structure | | Yes |
| Timelines for closing | | Yes |
| Representations and warranties | | Yes |
| Cost allocation for failed deal | Yes | |

Technology professionals should pay close attention to this distinction. A binding exclusivity clause, for example, can prevent a startup from entertaining competing acquisition offers for months. Similarly, a binding confidentiality clause protects shared technical documentation and intellectual property regardless of whether the deal ultimately closes.

## LOI in Technology Transactions

Letters of intent appear across many technology business contexts. The table below outlines common scenarios and what each LOI typically emphasizes.

| Scenario | Key LOI Focus Areas |
|---|---|
| Mergers and acquisitions | Valuation, IP ownership, employee retention, earn-outs, due diligence scope |
| Strategic partnerships | Revenue sharing, integration requirements, data access, co-development terms |
| Enterprise software licensing | License scope, pricing model, SLAs, support obligations, renewal terms |
| Vendor and outsourcing engagements | Deliverables, acceptance criteria, transition planning, data security |
| Joint ventures | Governance structure, capital contributions, IP allocation, exit provisions |
| Employment of key technical talent | Compensation, role definition, non-compete terms, equity grants |

In each of these cases, the LOI allows technology leaders to validate strategic fit and commercial alignment before committing engineering teams, infrastructure, or capital.

## Best Practices for Technology Professionals

When drafting or reviewing a letter of intent, technology professionals should follow several guidelines to protect their interests and accelerate the path to a definitive agreement:

- **Engage legal counsel early.** Even though the LOI is largely non-binding, poorly worded provisions can create unintended obligations. Have an attorney review the document before signing.
- **Define IP ownership clearly.** Ambiguity around intellectual property is one of the most common sources of dispute in technology deals. The LOI should address who owns existing IP, who will own jointly developed IP, and what licensing rights survive if the deal fails.
- **Set a realistic exclusivity window.** Exclusivity periods should be long enough to complete due diligence but short enough to avoid prolonged uncertainty. Thirty to ninety days is standard for most technology transactions.
- **Specify due diligence access.** Outline what systems, repositories, documentation, and personnel the acquiring or partnering party can access during the review period. This prevents scope disputes later.
- **Include a break-up fee or cost-sharing provision if appropriate.** For large transactions, consider whether the parties should share costs if the deal falls through, particularly when significant technical evaluation is required.
- **Keep the LOI concise.** The purpose is to establish alignment, not to replicate the final contract. Overly detailed LOIs slow down negotiations and can create conflicting obligations when the definitive agreement is drafted.

## Common Pitfalls

Technology deals often encounter specific problems at the LOI stage:

- **Treating the LOI as the final agreement.** Parties sometimes become complacent after signing an LOI, assuming the deal is done. The LOI is a starting point, not a finish line. Critical terms will still require negotiation.
- **Neglecting technical due diligence scope.** Failing to define what technical review is permitted can lead to disputes about access to source code, architecture documentation, or security audit reports.
- **Overlooking regulatory requirements.** Technology transactions may trigger antitrust review, export control considerations, or data privacy compliance obligations. The LOI should acknowledge these requirements and build in time to address them.
- **Ignoring cultural and operational fit.** Particularly in acquisitions, the LOI stage is the right time to assess whether engineering cultures, development methodologies, and technology stacks are compatible.
- **Failing to address what happens if the deal fails.** Without clear termination provisions and confidentiality protections, a failed negotiation can leave proprietary information exposed and relationships damaged.

## Summary

A letter of intent is a foundational document in technology business transactions that captures preliminary terms and demonstrates mutual commitment between negotiating parties. While predominantly non-binding, it typically contains enforceable provisions around confidentiality, exclusivity, and governing law. For technology professionals, the LOI is a critical tool for aligning expectations around valuation, intellectual property, due diligence access, and deal structure before investing significant resources in formal contract drafting. A well-crafted LOI accelerates negotiations, reduces risk, and establishes the trust necessary to reach a successful definitive agreement.
