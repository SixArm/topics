## Letter of Intent (LOI)

A letter of intent (LOI), also known as a memorandum of understanding (MOU), is a document that outlines the preliminary understanding between two parties about a potential transaction or agreement. For technology professionals, LOIs frequently appear during company acquisitions, partnership negotiations, licensing deals, and employment transitions.

## Purpose and Function

The primary purpose of an LOI is to establish a shared understanding of key terms before investing significant time and resources into drafting comprehensive legal agreements. It signals serious intent while allowing both parties to conduct due diligence, negotiate details, and assess compatibility.

**Key functions include:**

- Documenting preliminary agreement on major terms
- Establishing a framework for negotiations
- Demonstrating commitment to proceed in good faith
- Allowing due diligence to begin under agreed conditions
- Setting timelines and milestones for completing a deal

## Binding vs. Non-Binding Provisions

Most LOIs are intentionally non-binding regarding the main transaction terms. However, certain provisions are typically binding:

| Provision Type | Typically Binding | Purpose |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Confidentiality | Yes | Protects sensitive information shared during negotiations |
| Exclusivity | Yes | Prevents parallel negotiations with competitors |
| Transaction Terms | No | Allows flexibility during due diligence |
| Financial Terms | No | Subject to change based on findings |
| Closing Conditions | No | May evolve as deal progresses |
| Governing Law | Yes | Establishes jurisdiction for disputes |
| Break-up Fees | Sometimes | Compensates party if deal fails under certain conditions |

## Typical Provisions

An effective LOI for technology transactions should address the following elements:

**Parties Involved**
- Legal names and addresses of all parties
- Authorized representatives and their contact information
- Corporate structure details when relevant

**Transaction Description**
- Nature of the proposed transaction (acquisition, partnership, licensing)
- Assets, products, or services involved
- Scope and boundaries of the agreement

**Financial Terms**
- Proposed purchase price or compensation structure
- Payment terms and schedule
- Earnout provisions or performance-based payments
- Treatment of existing debt or liabilities

**Timelines**
- Due diligence period duration
- Target date for signing definitive agreement
- Anticipated closing date
- Key milestones and deadlines

**Confidentiality**
- Scope of confidential information
- Permitted disclosures
- Duration of confidentiality obligations
- Return or destruction of materials if deal fails

**Exclusivity Period**
- Duration of exclusive negotiation rights
- Restrictions on soliciting competing offers
- Consequences of exclusivity breach

**Governing Law**
- Jurisdiction for dispute resolution
- Choice of law provisions
- Arbitration or mediation requirements

## Common Use Cases in Technology

| Scenario | Typical LOI Focus |
|----------|-------------------|
| Mergers and Acquisitions | Valuation, deal structure, employee retention, IP transfer |
| Technology Licensing | Scope of license, royalties, exclusivity, territory |
| Strategic Partnerships | Resource commitments, revenue sharing, governance |
| Venture Capital Investment | Valuation, investment amount, board seats, liquidation preferences |
| Acqui-hires | Employee retention terms, IP assignment, transition timeline |
| Joint Ventures | Ownership split, operational control, exit mechanisms |

## Technology-Specific Considerations

When drafting or reviewing an LOI in technology contexts, pay particular attention to:

**Intellectual Property**
- Ownership of existing IP versus newly developed IP
- License grants and restrictions
- Open source compliance and obligations
- Patent assignments and warranties

**Data and Privacy**
- Data transfer and handling requirements
- Privacy regulation compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- Customer data ownership and portability
- Security standards and certifications

**Technical Due Diligence**
- Code review access and scope
- Infrastructure and architecture assessment
- Technical debt evaluation
- Security vulnerability assessments

**Employee and Contractor Matters**
- Key employee retention requirements
- Non-compete and non-solicitation terms
- Contractor agreement assignments
- Stock option and equity treatment

## Benefits and Limitations

**Benefits:**
- Establishes mutual understanding before major investment of resources
- Creates documentation trail of negotiations
- Allows parties to identify deal-breakers early
- Provides structure for complex, multi-faceted deals
- Signals seriousness to stakeholders and investors

**Limitations:**
- Generally non-binding for core terms
- May create false sense of security about deal completion
- Can expose confidential information if deal fails
- Exclusivity periods limit negotiating leverage
- May trigger regulatory disclosure requirements in some cases

## Best Practices

**Before Signing:**
- Clearly identify which provisions are binding versus non-binding
- Ensure exclusivity periods are reasonable and necessary
- Review confidentiality scope carefully
- Understand termination conditions and consequences
- Consult legal counsel familiar with your industry

**During Negotiation:**
- Use specific, unambiguous language
- Include all material terms to avoid later surprises
- Document any verbal agreements in writing
- Keep internal stakeholders informed
- Maintain records of all communications

**After Signing:**
- Adhere strictly to binding provisions
- Track deadlines and milestones
- Document due diligence activities
- Communicate proactively about timeline changes
- Begin preparing definitive agreement drafts

## LOI vs. Related Documents

| Document | Purpose | Binding Nature |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Letter of Intent (LOI) | Outlines preliminary terms for potential transaction | Mostly non-binding |
| Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) | Similar to LOI, often used interchangeably | Mostly non-binding |
| Term Sheet | Summarizes key investment terms, common in VC deals | Mostly non-binding |
| Letter of Agreement | Shorter form contract for simple arrangements | Typically binding |
| Definitive Agreement | Final, comprehensive contract | Fully binding |
| Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) | Protects confidential information | Binding |

## Conclusion

A letter of intent serves as a critical bridge between initial discussions and binding agreements in technology transactions. While mostly non-binding, it provides structure for negotiations, protects confidential information, and demonstrates serious commitment to completing a deal. Technology professionals should approach LOIs with careful attention to IP rights, data considerations, and technical due diligence requirements. Always engage qualified legal counsel to review and negotiate LOI terms before signing.
