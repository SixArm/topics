  <p>Delivering value to the customer</p>
  <p>Lean software development, inspired by Toyota's lean manufacturing principles from the 1940s and 1950s, places delivering value to the customer as its primary focus. This means teams should prioritize features and functionality that directly contribute to the customer's needs, while eliminating waste, improving continuously, empowering the team, and building quality into the process from the beginning.</p>
