  <p>When a small business operating at a steady level initiates a transition to become a startup</p>
  <p>A startup step-up occurs when an existing small business—such as a solopreneur, cottage business, or lifestyle business—decides to transform into a growth-oriented startup. This transition typically involves changes like service automation, mass production, mass marketing, or bringing in a startup entrepreneur to scale the business beyond its original steady-state operations.</p>
