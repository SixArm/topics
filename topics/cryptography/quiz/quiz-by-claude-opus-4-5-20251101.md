Question: What is the key difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography?

- [ ] Symmetric cryptography is slower but more secure than asymmetric cryptography
- [ ] Asymmetric cryptography uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, while symmetric cryptography uses the same key for both
- [ ] Symmetric cryptography can only encrypt text data, while asymmetric cryptography can encrypt any data type
- [ ] Asymmetric cryptography requires the key to be shared in person, while symmetric cryptography allows key sharing over the network

  <p>Asymmetric cryptography uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, while symmetric cryptography uses the same key for both</p>
  <p>This is the fundamental distinction between the two approaches. In symmetric cryptography, the same secret key must be shared between communicating parties and is used for both encryption and decryption. In asymmetric cryptography, a public key (which can be freely shared) encrypts data, while only the corresponding private key (kept secret by the owner) can decrypt it. This difference has significant implications for key distribution and security architecture.</p>
