# Machine learning precision

Question: What does precision measure in a machine learning classification model?

- [ ] The proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly identified by the model
- [ ] The proportion of predicted positive instances that are actually positive
- [ ] The overall percentage of correct predictions across all classes
- [ ] The balance between false positives and false negatives

  <p>The proportion of predicted positive instances that are actually positive</p>
  <p>Precision measures how many of the predicted positive instances are actually positive. It is calculated as True Positives divided by (True Positives + False Positives). This metric is particularly useful when the cost of false positives is high, as high precision indicates that when the model predicts a positive instance, it is likely to be correct.</p>
