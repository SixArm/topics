# What is this book?

Agile Change Guide is a glossary guide ebook that describes one topic per page. The guide is intended for quick easy learning about the agile manifesto, rapid development, and ways of working with users.

### Why these topics?

All the topics here are chosen because they have come up in real-world projects, with real-world stakeholders who want to learn about the topic.

If you have suggestions for more topics, then please let me know.

### What is the topic order?

You can read any topic page, in any order, at any time. Each topic page is intended be clear on its own, without needing cross-references or links.

## Who is this for?

People should read this guide if they want to learn quickly about agile software engineering, and how its practiced in companies today. Some of the ideas may be obvious, especially to experienced project leaders, software developers, business coaches, and change management trainers.

## Why am I creating this?

I am creating this ebook because of  years of experience in consulting work, with a wide range of clients, from small startups to enormous enterprises. This kind of agile change is present in many of the projects and at many of the clients.

### For team collaboration

When I work with companies and teams, then I'm able to use glossaries like this one to help create shared context and clearer communication. This can accelerate working together, and can help teams forge better project plans, in my direct experience.

For example, one of my enterprise clients describes this kind of shared context and clear communication in a positive sense as "singing from the same songbook". When a team understands agile terminology, and has a quick easy glossary for definitions and explanations, then it's akin to teammates with the same songbook.
