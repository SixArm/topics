## Why is this useful??

I am creating this ebook because of  years of experience in consulting work, with a wide range of clients, from small startups to enormous enterprises. This kind of agile change is present in many of the projects and at many of the clients.

### For team collaboration

When I work with companies and teams, then I'm able to use glossaries like this one to help create shared context and clearer communication. This can accelerate working together, and can help teams forge better project plans, in my direct experience.

For example, one of my enterprise clients describes this kind of shared context and clear communication in a positive sense as "singing from the same songbook". When a team understands agile terminology, and has a quick easy glossary for definitions and explanations, then it's akin to teammates with the same songbook.
