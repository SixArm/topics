One of the most powerful applications of this guide is as a team alignment tool. When everyone on a team references the same definitions and explanations, communication becomes clearer and collaboration accelerates. Think of it as ensuring your team is "singing from the same songbook."

2. **Read relevant topics**: Focus on the topics most applicable to your current projects or role.
3. **Share with your team**: Distribute relevant topic pages to teammates to establish common vocabulary.
4. **Reference during planning**: Use topic pages during sprint planning, retrospectives, or stakeholder meetings to ground discussions in shared definitions.
5. **Revisit periodically**: As your projects evolve, return to topics that become newly relevant.
