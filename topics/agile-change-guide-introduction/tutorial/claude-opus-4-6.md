# What is this book?

The Agile Change Guide is a glossary-style ebook designed for technology professionals who want a practical, accessible reference on agile software development. Each topic occupies a single page and is written to stand on its own, so readers can jump to any entry without prerequisites. The guide draws from real-world consulting engagements across startups, mid-size firms, and large enterprises, capturing the terminology, principles, and practices that surface repeatedly in agile transformations. This tutorial unpacks the purpose, audience, structure, and value of the guide so you can decide how best to use it in your own work.

## Purpose and Scope

The Agile Change Guide covers the agile manifesto, rapid development practices, and techniques for working effectively with users and stakeholders. Rather than offering a single linear curriculum, it functions as a quick-reference glossary: one topic, one page, one clear explanation.

The guide exists because agile terminology is broad and often inconsistently defined across organizations. Having a shared, concise reference reduces miscommunication and accelerates decision-making. Topics were selected based on their frequency and importance in real consulting projects, not from abstract theory.

## Who Should Read It

The guide is written for a wide audience, but it delivers the most value to professionals who are either new to agile or who work alongside teams adopting agile practices.

| Audience | What They Gain |
|---|---|
| Software developers | Clear definitions of agile ceremonies, artifacts, and workflows they encounter daily |
| Project managers | A shared vocabulary for planning, estimation, and stakeholder communication |
| Business coaches | Ready-made explanations they can use in training sessions and workshops |
| Change management trainers | Concise descriptions of agile concepts to embed in organizational transformation programs |
| Executive sponsors | Quick orientation on agile terminology without needing to attend a full certification course |

Experienced agile practitioners may find some entries obvious, but even seasoned professionals benefit from having a single canonical reference when onboarding new team members or aligning cross-functional groups.

## How to Read It

The guide is intentionally non-sequential. There is no required reading order, no dependency chain between topics, and no cross-references that force you to read one entry before another. This design supports several usage patterns:

- **Just-in-time lookup.** Encounter an unfamiliar term in a meeting or document and look it up immediately.
- **Onboarding companion.** Hand the guide to a new team member and let them browse topics relevant to their role.
- **Workshop material.** Pull individual pages into presentations or training decks without needing to extract them from a larger narrative.
- **Team alignment tool.** Distribute the guide so everyone operates from the same definitions, reducing ambiguity in retrospectives, sprint planning, and stakeholder reviews.

## Why Shared Context Matters

One of the most practical benefits of the guide is establishing shared context within a team or organization. In consulting work, misaligned definitions are a persistent source of friction. When one person says "sprint" and means a fixed two-week iteration while another interprets it as any short burst of focused work, planning conversations break down.

The guide addresses this by providing a single authoritative source. As one enterprise client described it, adopting a shared glossary is like "singing from the same songbook." The metaphor is apt: a team that agrees on definitions can move faster, debate substance rather than semantics, and produce clearer documentation.

The benefits of shared context compound over time:

- **Faster onboarding.** New hires absorb terminology in days rather than weeks.
- **Clearer communication.** Meetings produce actionable outcomes because participants mean the same thing when they use the same words.
- **Better documentation.** Project plans, user stories, and retrospective notes become more precise and useful as artifacts.
- **Reduced conflict.** Disagreements rooted in definitional confusion disappear, freeing teams to focus on genuine trade-offs.

## Relationship to Other Guides

The Agile Change Guide is part of a family of reference guides that cover adjacent domains. Together, they form a comprehensive library for technology professionals navigating modern software organizations.

| Guide | Focus Area |
|---|---|
| Innovation Partnership Guide | Structuring and managing innovation-oriented partnerships |
| Startup Business Guide | Founding, funding, and growing a startup |
| Business Lingo Guide | General business terminology and concepts |
| Project Management Guide | Planning, execution, and delivery of projects |
| UI/UX Design Guide | User interface and user experience design principles |
| Test Automation Guide | Automated testing strategies and tools |
| AI Starter Guide | Foundational concepts in artificial intelligence |
| Software Programming Guide | Core software engineering practices and patterns |

You do not need to read all of these guides. Pick the ones that align with your current role or the challenges you are facing. The Agile Change Guide pairs especially well with the Project Management Guide for professionals leading agile transformations, and with the Business Lingo Guide for those who need to bridge technical and business conversations.
