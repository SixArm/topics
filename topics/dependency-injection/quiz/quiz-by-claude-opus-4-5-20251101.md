# Dependency Injection

Question: What is the primary purpose of dependency injection in software development?

- [ ] To increase the speed of application execution by reducing method calls
- [ ] To reduce coupling between components by passing dependent objects from the outside rather than creating them internally
- [ ] To automatically generate database schemas from class definitions
- [ ] To encrypt communication between different modules of an application

  <p>To reduce coupling between components by passing dependent objects from the outside rather than creating them internally</p>
  <p>Dependency injection is a design pattern that reduces coupling between software components by having dependent objects passed to a class or method from outside, rather than having the class create them itself. This approach improves flexibility, modularity, and testability, as components can be easily swapped or mocked without modifying the classes that use them.</p>
