  <p>Angel investors</p>
  <p>Angel investors are high net worth individuals who provide funding in the early stages of development, before a startup has a proven track record. Unlike venture capital firms, they typically invest smaller amounts and provide valuable mentorship to founders. Friends and family investors also come early but invest based on personal relationships rather than business evaluation. Venture capital and Series B investors typically invest in later stages when companies have demonstrated growth and traction.</p>
