  <p>Focus on perseverance, thriftiness, and delayed gratification</p>
  <p>Long-term oriented cultures emphasize planning for the future, saving and investing (thriftiness), persistence, and a willingness to delay immediate rewards for greater future benefits. In contrast, short-term oriented cultures prioritize immediate needs, quick results, and present-moment satisfaction. For technology professionals, understanding this dimension helps when working with international teams or deploying products across different markets—some cultures may favor rapid iteration and quick wins, while others prefer methodical, long-term strategic approaches.</p>
