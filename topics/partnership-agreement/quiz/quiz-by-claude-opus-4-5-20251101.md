  <p>To outline the terms governing the partnership including rights, responsibilities, and obligations of each partner</p>
  <p>A partnership agreement is a legally binding contract that defines the foundational structure of the partnership. It covers critical elements such as contributions (capital, IP, skills), profit sharing, management roles, decision-making authority, dispute resolution, and exit procedures. For technology professionals, this is essential because it clarifies ownership of intellectual property, defines who has authority to make technical and business decisions, and establishes how disputes will be resolved—all crucial factors when building technology products or services with partners.</p>
