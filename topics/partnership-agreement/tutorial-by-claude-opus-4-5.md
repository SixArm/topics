## Partnership Agreement: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

### What Is a Partnership Agreement?

A partnership agreement is a legally binding contract between two or more individuals or entities establishing a business partnership. This foundational document defines the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of each partner, serving as the operational constitution for the venture.

For technology professionals—whether founding a startup, consulting firm, or development agency—a well-drafted partnership agreement prevents costly disputes and provides clarity when difficult decisions arise.

### Why Technology Partnerships Need Formal Agreements

Technology ventures present unique challenges that make formal agreements essential:

- **Intellectual property ownership** can be ambiguous without explicit terms
- **Equity splits** often need to account for technical versus business contributions
- **Vesting schedules** protect against early departures
- **Technical decision-making authority** must be clearly allocated
- **Rapid scaling** can strain informal understandings

Even partnerships between friends or longtime collaborators require written agreements. Verbal understandings frequently fail when money, stress, or disagreements enter the picture.

### Core Components of a Partnership Agreement

| Component | Purpose | Technology-Specific Considerations |
|-----------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Purpose | Defines business name, nature, and duration | Specify technical domain, target markets, product scope |
| Contributions | Documents what each partner brings | Include code, patents, trade secrets, equipment, customer relationships |
| Management | Establishes roles and decision authority | Define who controls technical architecture, hiring, vendor selection |
| Profit Sharing | Allocates financial outcomes | Consider equity versus salary tradeoffs common in tech startups |
| Authority | Sets limits on partner actions | Specify thresholds for contracts, expenditures, licensing decisions |
| Dispute Resolution | Provides conflict resolution mechanisms | Include provisions for technical disagreements and deadlocks |
| Exit | Governs departures and dissolution | Address IP ownership, code access, and customer transition |
| Non-Compete/Confidentiality | Protects business interests | Cover proprietary algorithms, customer data, and competitive restrictions |
| Amendments | Defines modification procedures | Establish process for pivots and strategic changes |

### Defining Purpose and Scope

The purpose section establishes the partnership's fundamental parameters:

- **Business name**: The legal name under which the partnership operates
- **Nature of business**: Specific activities the partnership will conduct
- **Duration**: Fixed term or indefinite with termination provisions
- **Geographic scope**: Where the partnership will operate
- **Product/service boundaries**: What falls inside and outside the partnership's domain

Technology partnerships should be specific about scope. A "mobile app development" partnership differs significantly from a "software consulting" partnership in terms of IP creation, client relationships, and liability exposure.

### Structuring Contributions

Partners contribute value in multiple forms:

**Capital Contributions**
- Cash investments
- Equipment and hardware
- Software licenses and subscriptions

**Intellectual Property Contributions**
- Existing codebases or libraries
- Patents and patent applications
- Trade secrets and proprietary methods
- Domain names and trademarks

**Service Contributions**
- Technical expertise and development time
- Business development and sales
- Operational management

**Valuation Challenges**

| Contribution Type | Valuation Approach |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cash | Face value |
| Equipment | Fair market value or depreciated book value |
| Existing IP | Independent appraisal or negotiated value |
| Sweat equity | Hourly rate × committed hours, or equity-based |
| Customer relationships | Revenue potential or comparable transaction analysis |

Technology partnerships frequently struggle with valuing IP and sweat equity. Address this directly in the agreement rather than deferring the conversation.

### Management and Decision-Making

Clear governance prevents paralysis and conflict:

**Day-to-Day Operations**
- Designate a managing partner or rotate responsibilities
- Define spending authority thresholds
- Establish approval requirements for contracts

**Strategic Decisions**
- Require unanimous consent for major pivots
- Define what constitutes a "major" decision
- Create voting procedures for multi-partner arrangements

**Technical Authority**

Technology partnerships must explicitly address:

- Architecture and technology stack decisions
- Hiring and team composition
- Code quality standards and review processes
- Security and compliance requirements
- Vendor and tool selection

A common structure assigns technical authority to the technical co-founder while business authority goes to the business co-founder, with major decisions requiring agreement.

### Profit and Loss Distribution

Distribution methods vary based on partnership structure:

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Equal split | 50/50 or equal shares | Equal contributions, similar roles |
| Contribution-based | Proportional to capital invested | Capital-intensive ventures |
| Tiered | Different rates at different profit levels | Incentivizing growth |
| Salary plus distribution | Fixed compensation plus profit share | Mixed active/passive partners |
| Performance-based | Tied to metrics or milestones | Technical versus sales roles |

Technology startups often combine below-market salaries with equity upside. The agreement should specify:

- When and how profits are distributed
- Whether distributions are mandatory or discretionary
- How losses are allocated
- Partner loan provisions for capital calls

### Authority and Binding Power

Partners can bind the partnership legally, creating significant risk:

**Typical Authority Limits**

- Contracts above a specified value require multiple signatures
- Employment offers need partner approval
- IP licensing decisions require unanimous consent
- Debt or financing requires all partners

**Express Limitations**

The agreement should list actions no partner can take unilaterally:

- Selling or licensing core intellectual property
- Entering exclusive agreements
- Admitting new partners
- Making capital commitments beyond defined thresholds
- Settling disputes or litigation

### Dispute Resolution

Disagreements are inevitable. Structured resolution processes preserve both the partnership and partner relationships:

**Resolution Hierarchy**

1. **Direct negotiation**: Partners attempt resolution themselves
2. **Mediation**: Neutral third party facilitates discussion
3. **Arbitration**: Binding decision by arbitrator
4. **Litigation**: Court proceedings (last resort)

**Technical Deadlock Provisions**

Technology partnerships should address technical disagreements specifically:

- Designate a technical tiebreaker
- Establish criteria for evaluating competing approaches
- Create timeboxed experimentation periods for proof-of-concept
- Define escalation to external technical advisors

**Buyout Triggers**

Some disputes are irresolvable. Include provisions for:

- Voluntary buyout procedures
- Forced buyout conditions
- Valuation methodology
- Payment terms

### Exit Provisions

Partners leave for many reasons—retirement, new opportunities, disagreements, or death. Exit provisions protect everyone:

**Voluntary Withdrawal**

- Required notice period
- Transition responsibilities
- Non-compete activation
- Buyout pricing and terms

**Involuntary Removal**

- Grounds for removal (breach, incapacity, bankruptcy)
- Voting requirements
- Appeal processes
- Compensation upon removal

**Death or Disability**

- Insurance requirements
- Buyout obligations
- Heir and estate provisions
- Business continuity procedures

**Technology-Specific Exit Considerations**

| Issue | Provision Needed |
|-------|------------------|
| Code access | Departing partner's repository access revocation |
| Customer relationships | Non-solicitation terms and transition period |
| Pre-existing IP | Return or licensing of contributed IP |
| Work product | Clear assignment of created IP to partnership |
| Credentials and accounts | Transfer procedures for shared resources |

### Intellectual Property Provisions

IP provisions are critical for technology partnerships:

**Pre-Existing IP**

- Clearly identify what each partner brings
- Specify license terms for use by partnership
- Define ownership if partnership dissolves

**Partnership-Created IP**

- Default rule: partnership owns all work product
- Consider carve-outs for unrelated personal projects
- Address improvements to pre-existing IP

**Assignment Provisions**

Ensure the agreement includes:

- Present assignment of future work product
- Work-for-hire provisions where applicable
- Moral rights waivers if relevant

**Open Source Considerations**

If the partnership uses or contributes to open source:

- Define contribution approval processes
- Address licensing implications
- Establish policies for incorporating open source dependencies

### Non-Compete and Confidentiality

**Non-Compete Clauses**

Enforceability varies by jurisdiction. Well-drafted provisions include:

- Reasonable geographic scope
- Limited duration (typically 1-3 years post-departure)
- Specific activity restrictions
- Consideration for the restriction

**Confidentiality Obligations**

- Define confidential information broadly but specifically
- Establish handling procedures
- Specify duration (often survives partnership termination)
- Address required disclosures (legal, regulatory)

**Carve-Outs**

Technology professionals often have side projects or consulting work. Address:

- Permitted outside activities
- Disclosure requirements
- Conflict approval processes
- IP ownership for outside work

### Amendment Procedures

Partnerships evolve. Amendment provisions should specify:

- Voting thresholds (unanimous, supermajority, majority)
- Notice requirements
- Documentation standards
- Waiting periods before effectiveness

Consider different thresholds for different provisions—fundamental terms may require unanimity while operational details need only majority approval.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Vague Language**

Avoid terms like "reasonable efforts" or "fair share" without definition. Specificity prevents disputes.

**Missing Deadlock Provisions**

50/50 partnerships without tiebreaker mechanisms can become paralyzed. Include buyout provisions or third-party resolution.

**Ignoring Tax Implications**

Partnership structures have significant tax consequences. Consult tax professionals during drafting.

**Oral Side Agreements**

If you agree to something different from the written agreement, amend the document. Oral modifications create confusion and may be unenforceable.

**Copying Templates Without Customization**

Generic templates miss industry-specific needs. Technology partnerships require provisions for IP, technical decisions, and digital assets that standard forms lack.

### When to Involve Professionals

While partners can draft preliminary terms themselves, professional review is valuable for:

- Final agreement drafting and review
- Tax structure optimization
- Regulatory compliance (securities, professional licensing)
- IP assignment validity
- Enforceability of restrictive covenants

### Partnership Agreement Checklist
