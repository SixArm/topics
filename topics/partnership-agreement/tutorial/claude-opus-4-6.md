# Partnership agreement

A partnership agreement is a legally binding contract between two or more individuals or entities who establish a partnership to pursue shared business objectives. For technology professionals, partnership agreements are foundational documents that govern joint ventures, co-development projects, startup co-founder relationships, and strategic alliances. A well-drafted agreement protects intellectual property, clarifies decision-making authority, and provides a framework for resolving disputes before they escalate. Whether you are forming a two-person startup or entering into a multi-party technology alliance, understanding the structure and purpose of a partnership agreement is essential to managing risk and aligning expectations.

## Purpose and Scope

The partnership agreement begins by defining the fundamental identity and intent of the partnership. This includes the legal name of the partnership, the nature of the business (such as software development, consulting, or product commercialization), and the planned duration. Some partnerships are created for a fixed term tied to a specific project, while others operate indefinitely until dissolved by the partners.

For technology partnerships, the scope section is particularly important because it sets boundaries around what the partnership will and will not do. A clear scope prevents mission creep, protects each partner's independent business activities, and establishes the domain in which shared intellectual property applies.

## Partner Contributions

Each partner brings something to the partnership, and the agreement must clearly document what each party contributes. Contributions in technology partnerships commonly fall into several categories.

| Contribution Type | Examples | Considerations |
|---|---|---|
| Capital | Cash investment, funding commitments | Specify amounts, timing, and conditions for additional contributions |
| Intellectual Property | Patents, source code, trade secrets, algorithms | Define ownership, licensing terms, and what happens to IP upon dissolution |
| Assets | Hardware, servers, domain names, software licenses | Clarify whether assets are transferred, licensed, or loaned to the partnership |
| Skills and Labor | Engineering time, design expertise, sales relationships | Quantify expected time commitments and how labor is valued relative to capital |

Documenting contributions with precision prevents disputes later about who owns what and who is owed what, especially when the partnership's assets grow in value.

## Management and Decision-Making

The agreement should define the governance structure of the partnership, including how day-to-day decisions are made, who has authority over specific domains, and how major strategic decisions are handled. Common governance models include:

- **Equal management**, where all partners have an equal vote on all decisions
- **Designated management**, where specific partners manage specific areas such as technology, finance, or business development
- **Managing partner**, where one partner is appointed to handle operations with defined limits on authority
- **Board or committee governance**, where a formal decision-making body is established for partnerships with many participants

For technology partnerships, it is critical to specify who has authority over technical architecture decisions, hiring of engineers, selection of tools and platforms, and the release of software products.

## Profit and Loss Sharing

The agreement must describe how the partnership distributes profits and absorbs losses. This does not have to follow the same ratio as capital contributions. Partners who contribute primarily through labor or intellectual property may negotiate profit-sharing arrangements that differ from their initial investment.

Key elements to address include:

- The ratio or formula for distributing net profits
- How losses are allocated among partners
- The frequency and method of distributions (monthly, quarterly, annually)
- Whether profits are reinvested automatically or distributed by default
- Tax treatment and reporting responsibilities for each partner

## Authority and Binding Power

Not every partner should have the authority to sign contracts, take on debt, or make commitments on behalf of the partnership. The agreement should specify:

- Which partners can enter into contracts and up to what monetary threshold
- Whether any partner requires co-signature or majority approval for specific actions
- Restrictions on individual partners from making unilateral commitments that bind the partnership
- The process for granting and revoking authority

In technology partnerships, this section often addresses who can sign vendor agreements, enter into licensing deals, or commit to service-level agreements with clients.

## Intellectual Property and Confidentiality

Intellectual property is frequently the most valuable asset in a technology partnership. The agreement must address IP with care and specificity:

- **Background IP**: Each partner's pre-existing intellectual property should be identified and remain owned by the contributing partner unless explicitly assigned.
- **Foreground IP**: New intellectual property created during the partnership should have clear ownership rules, whether jointly owned, assigned to the partnership entity, or allocated based on contribution.
- **Licensing**: If one partner's background IP is used in partnership activities, the agreement should define the scope, duration, and exclusivity of any license granted.
- **Confidentiality**: Partners should agree to protect each other's proprietary information, trade secrets, and business strategies during and after the partnership.
- **Non-compete provisions**: The agreement may restrict partners from engaging in competing activities during the partnership term and for a defined period after exit.

## Dispute Resolution

Disputes between partners are common and, without a resolution framework, can destroy the partnership. The agreement should establish a clear escalation path:

- **Negotiation**: Partners first attempt to resolve disputes through direct discussion within a specified timeframe.
- **Mediation**: If negotiation fails, a neutral third-party mediator facilitates a resolution.
- **Arbitration**: If mediation fails, the dispute is submitted to binding arbitration under agreed rules.
- **Litigation**: As a last resort, partners may pursue legal action, with the agreement specifying jurisdiction and governing law.

Including a dispute resolution clause is far less expensive than litigating disagreements without one.

## Exit and Dissolution

The agreement must plan for how partners leave the partnership and how the partnership itself can be dissolved. Key provisions include:

- **Voluntary withdrawal**: The notice period and process for a partner who chooses to leave
- **Involuntary removal**: Circumstances under which a partner can be removed, such as breach of agreement, bankruptcy, or incapacity
- **Buyout terms**: How the departing partner's interest is valued and purchased, including valuation methods and payment timelines
- **Dissolution triggers**: Events that cause the entire partnership to dissolve, such as mutual agreement, expiration of the term, or loss of a key partner
- **Wind-down process**: How remaining assets and liabilities are distributed, contracts are assigned or terminated, and final accounting is completed

For technology partnerships, the exit section should specifically address what happens to shared codebases, customer relationships, domain names, and deployed infrastructure.

## Amendments and Modifications

The partnership agreement is a living document that may need to change as circumstances evolve. The agreement should specify the process for making amendments, including whether changes require unanimous consent or a specific majority, whether amendments must be in writing, and the notice period required before changes take effect.

## Summary

A partnership agreement is the contractual foundation that defines how partners collaborate, share value, resolve conflicts, and part ways. For technology professionals, it is especially critical because of the central role that intellectual property, technical decision-making authority, and evolving project scope play in partnership success. A thorough agreement addresses purpose, contributions, governance, profit sharing, authority, intellectual property, confidentiality, dispute resolution, exit mechanics, and amendment procedures. Investing time in a well-structured partnership agreement at the outset prevents costly disputes, protects each party's interests, and creates a framework for productive long-term collaboration.
