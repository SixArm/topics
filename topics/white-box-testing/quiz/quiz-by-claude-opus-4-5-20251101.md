  <p>White-box testing examines internal code structure and implementation details</p>
  <p>White-box testing gives testers complete knowledge of the internal structure, code, and implementation details of the application. Testers analyze source code to design test cases that exercise execution paths, using techniques like statement coverage, branch coverage, and path coverage. This contrasts with black-box testing, which focuses solely on inputs and outputs without knowledge of internal workings.</p>
