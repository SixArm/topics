# User stories

Question: What is the correct format for writing a user story in Agile software development?

- [ ] "The system shall allow users to view order history with timestamps and return status."
- [ ] "As a customer, I want to be able to view my order history so that I can track my purchases and returns."
- [ ] "Implement order history feature with database queries and UI components."
- [ ] "Order History: Display all past orders sorted by date with filtering options."

  <p>"As a customer, I want to be able to view my order history so that I can track my purchases and returns."</p>
  <p>User stories follow a specific three-part format: a persona or user ("As a customer"), a need or requirement ("I want to be able to view my order history"), and a goal or outcome ("so that I can track my purchases and returns"). This format captures the feature from the user's perspective, making it easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand, unlike system requirements specifications, technical implementation details, or feature descriptions that lack user context.</p>
