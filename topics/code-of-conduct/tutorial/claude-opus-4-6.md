# Code of conduct

A code of conduct is a formal document that defines the standards of behavior, ethical expectations, and guiding principles that individuals within an organization, project, or community are expected to follow. For technology professionals, codes of conduct play a critical role in shaping workplace culture, open source communities, and professional interactions. They establish shared norms, protect participants from harmful behavior, and create the foundation for trust, collaboration, and accountability across teams and organizations.

## Why codes of conduct matter in technology

Technology workplaces and communities are inherently collaborative environments where people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and communication styles must work together effectively. Without explicit behavioral guidelines, implicit norms can exclude underrepresented groups, allow toxic behavior to persist unchecked, and erode psychological safety.

A well-crafted code of conduct serves multiple purposes. It signals to newcomers what kind of environment they are entering. It gives leaders and moderators a framework for consistent decision-making when conflicts arise. It protects individuals by making it clear that harmful behavior will not be tolerated. And it strengthens the overall community or organization by fostering an environment where people can focus on productive work rather than navigating interpersonal hazards.

The rise of open source software has made codes of conduct especially prominent in the technology industry. Projects such as the Linux kernel, the Contributor Covenant, and the Apache Software Foundation have demonstrated that explicit behavioral standards are essential for sustaining large-scale collaboration among distributed contributors who may never meet in person.

## Core values and principles

A code of conduct typically begins with a statement of the values and ethical principles the organization is committed to upholding. These values serve as the philosophical foundation from which all specific rules and expectations flow.

Common core values in technology codes of conduct include:

- **Respect**: Treating all individuals with dignity regardless of their role, seniority, identity, or background.
- **Integrity**: Acting honestly and transparently in all professional dealings, including acknowledging mistakes and giving proper credit.
- **Inclusion**: Actively working to create environments where people of all backgrounds feel welcome and able to participate fully.
- **Collaboration**: Prioritizing constructive engagement, good-faith disagreement, and shared problem-solving over individual ego or competition.
- **Professionalism**: Maintaining appropriate standards of communication, reliability, and quality in all work products and interactions.
- **Accountability**: Accepting responsibility for one's actions and their impact on others, and supporting mechanisms for addressing harm.

These values are not merely aspirational statements. They provide the interpretive lens through which specific situations are evaluated when disputes or violations arise.

## Prohibited conduct

A code of conduct must clearly identify behaviors that are unacceptable. Ambiguity in this area undermines the document's effectiveness, because individuals may claim ignorance or argue that their behavior falls outside the stated boundaries.

The following table outlines categories of prohibited conduct commonly addressed in technology codes of conduct:

| Category | Examples | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Harassment | Unwelcome comments about personal characteristics, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions | Creates hostile environments, drives away contributors and employees |
| Discrimination | Exclusion or differential treatment based on race, gender, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics | Undermines equity and limits organizational diversity |
| Dishonesty | Plagiarism, misrepresenting credentials, fabricating data, taking credit for others' work | Erodes trust and damages professional relationships |
| Bullying | Public humiliation, repeated negative comments, power-based coercion, deliberately undermining someone's work | Reduces psychological safety, increases turnover |
| Privacy violations | Sharing private information without consent, doxxing, unauthorized access to personal data | Causes direct harm to individuals and creates legal liability |
| Retaliation | Punishing or marginalizing someone for reporting a violation or participating in an investigation | Suppresses reporting and allows misconduct to continue unchecked |

Technology-specific codes of conduct may also address behaviors such as weaponizing technical expertise to belittle less experienced colleagues, gatekeeping knowledge, or using review processes as vehicles for personal attacks rather than constructive feedback.

## Reporting, accountability, and dispute resolution

A code of conduct is only as effective as its enforcement mechanisms. Without clear procedures for reporting violations and holding individuals accountable, the document becomes performative rather than protective.

Effective reporting systems share several characteristics:

- **Multiple reporting channels**: Individuals should be able to report violations through more than one avenue, such as a direct manager, an HR representative, an anonymous hotline, or a designated conduct committee. This prevents situations where the only reporting path runs through the person causing harm.
- **Confidentiality protections**: Reporters should be assured that their identity will be protected to the greatest extent possible, and that retaliation will be treated as a separate violation.
- **Defined timelines**: The organization should commit to acknowledging reports within a specific timeframe and completing investigations within a reasonable period.
- **Proportional consequences**: Responses to violations should be graduated and proportional, ranging from private warnings to temporary suspension to permanent removal, depending on severity and pattern.
- **Appeals processes**: Individuals who are subject to disciplinary action should have a mechanism for appealing decisions they believe are unjust.

In open source communities, enforcement often falls to project maintainers or a dedicated conduct committee. In corporate settings, human resources departments and legal teams typically play central roles. Regardless of the context, the key principle is that enforcement must be consistent, transparent in its processes, and perceived as fair by participants.

## Training and education

Publishing a code of conduct is a necessary first step, but it is not sufficient on its own. Organizations must invest in training and education to ensure that all participants understand the code, can recognize violations, and know how to respond appropriately.

Effective training programs address several dimensions:

- **Awareness**: Ensuring that every member of the organization or community knows the code of conduct exists, where to find it, and what it contains.
- **Scenario-based learning**: Walking participants through realistic scenarios that illustrate how the code applies in practice, including ambiguous situations where the right course of action is not immediately obvious.
- **Bystander intervention**: Teaching individuals how to intervene constructively when they witness behavior that violates the code, rather than assuming someone else will act.
- **Leadership responsibility**: Providing additional training for managers, maintainers, and other leaders on their specific obligations to model appropriate behavior and respond to reports.
- **Onboarding integration**: Incorporating code of conduct review into the onboarding process for new employees, contributors, or community members so that expectations are established from the first interaction.

Training should not be a one-time event. Regular refreshers, updates when the code is revised, and ongoing conversations about culture and behavior help keep the code of conduct relevant and top of mind.

## Ongoing review and updates

A code of conduct is a living document that must evolve alongside the organization or community it serves. Social norms shift, new forms of harmful behavior emerge, and organizational structures change. A code that was effective five years ago may contain gaps or outdated language today.

Best practices for maintaining a code of conduct include:

- **Scheduled reviews**: Committing to reviewing the code at regular intervals, such as annually, rather than waiting for a crisis to prompt changes.
- **Community input**: Soliciting feedback from the people the code is intended to protect, particularly those from marginalized or underrepresented groups who may experience harm that the current code does not adequately address.
- **Incident retrospectives**: Using past incidents and enforcement actions as data points to identify areas where the code could be clearer, more specific, or more comprehensive.
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing the organization's code against industry standards, peer organizations, and widely adopted templates such as the Contributor Covenant or the TODO Group's Open Code of Conduct.
- **Version tracking**: Maintaining a changelog so that members can see what has changed and when, which builds trust in the process and helps with onboarding.

## Prominent codes of conduct in technology

Several codes of conduct have become influential templates and reference points within the technology industry:

| Code of Conduct | Context | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| Contributor Covenant | Open source projects | Widely adopted, focuses on inclusive community standards, provides clear enforcement guidelines |
| Apache Software Foundation Code of Conduct | ASF projects | Emphasizes respectful collaboration, covers both online and in-person interactions |
| Linux Kernel Code of Conduct | Linux development | Adopted in 2018 based on the Contributor Covenant, replaced the earlier "Code of Conflict" |
| ACM Code of Ethics | Computing professionals | Comprehensive professional ethics framework covering honesty, harm avoidance, and public interest |
| IEEE Code of Ethics | Engineers and technologists | Focuses on safety, honesty, avoiding conflicts of interest, and treating all persons fairly |
| Google Code of Conduct | Corporate workplace | Anchored by the phrase "Don't be evil," covers business ethics, conflicts of interest, and workplace behavior |

These templates provide a strong starting point, but organizations should adapt them to reflect their specific context, culture, and needs rather than adopting them unchanged.

## Summary

A code of conduct is an essential governance tool for technology professionals and the organizations and communities in which they operate. It establishes clear expectations for behavior, defines prohibited conduct, provides mechanisms for reporting and accountability, and creates the conditions for inclusive, productive collaboration. A code of conduct is most effective when it is backed by genuine enforcement, supported by ongoing training and education, and regularly reviewed and updated to reflect evolving norms and needs. For technology professionals, understanding and championing codes of conduct is not merely a compliance exercise but a core aspect of building the kind of environments where great work can happen.
