  <p>To simplify complex phenomena by abstracting essential elements, enabling prediction and decision-making</p>
  <p>Mental models serve as cognitive frameworks that help individuals organize understanding, simplify complexity through abstraction, and guide predictions and decisions. They are not about creating documentation, replacing education, or forcing uniform thinking—rather, they help people internalize concepts to better navigate complex information and make informed decisions based on their understanding of how systems work.</p>
