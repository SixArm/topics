  <p>It influences purchasing decisions and willingness to pay premium prices</p>
  <p>Strong brand recognition directly impacts a company's bottom line by influencing how consumers make purchasing decisions. When customers recognize and trust a brand, they are more likely to choose its products over competitors and are often willing to pay a premium for that perceived quality and reliability. This is particularly important in technology markets where many products may have similar features, making brand trust a key differentiator.</p>
