  <p>To establish a shared understanding of what constitutes completed work</p>
  <p>The Definition of Done serves as a comprehensive checklist or set of criteria that must be fulfilled before any user story, feature, or increment can be considered truly finished. It eliminates ambiguity about work completion, ensures all team members share the same expectations, and promotes transparency with stakeholders about what "done" means for their project.</p>
