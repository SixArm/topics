# Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) is an agile software engineering practice that establishes a shared understanding of what constitutes completed work within a development team. It serves as a comprehensive checklist or set of criteria that must be fulfilled before any user story, feature, or increment can be considered truly finished.

The Definition of Done typically encompasses various quality gates and standards that ensure consistency and maintain high-quality output. Common elements include code completion, unit testing with adequate coverage, code review completion, integration testing, documentation updates, and acceptance criteria fulfillment. It may also include performance benchmarks, security checks, accessibility standards, and deployment readiness criteria.

This practice provides numerous benefits to agile teams. It eliminates ambiguity about work completion, prevents scope creep, and ensures that all team members share the same expectations. The DoD also promotes transparency with stakeholders, as they can clearly understand what "done" means for their project. Additionally, it helps maintain technical debt at manageable levels by enforcing quality standards consistently.

The Definition of Done should be collaboratively developed by the entire team, including developers, testers, product owners, and other relevant stakeholders. Different levels of DoD may exist for individual tasks, user stories, sprints, or releases, with each level building upon the previous one.

Effective implementation requires the Definition of Done to be visible, accessible, and actively used during sprint planning, daily standups, and sprint reviews. Teams should resist the temptation to bypass the DoD under pressure, as this compromises quality and undermines the practice's effectiveness.
