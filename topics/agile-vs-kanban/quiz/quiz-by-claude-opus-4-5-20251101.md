  <p>Agile uses a push-style where customers push ideas to developers, while Kanban uses a pull-style where developers pull work from queues</p>
  <p>This distinction represents a core operational difference between the two methodologies. In Agile, customers and stakeholders push requirements and ideas into development work queues (such as sprint backlogs). In Kanban, developers pull work items from customer queues when they have capacity, enabling continuous flow without fixed iterations. Understanding this push vs. pull dynamic is essential for technology professionals because it affects how work is prioritized, how teams manage capacity, and why many organizations combine both approaches to leverage their complementary strengths.</p>
