# Agile versus Kanban

Agile and Kanban are both methodologies used in software engineering to manage and improve development processes, but they serve different purposes and operate at different levels.

Agile is a broader philosophy and framework that emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and responding to change. It encompasses various methodologies like Scrum, Extreme Programming, and Lean development, focusing on delivering working software in short iterations called sprints.

Kanban, on the other hand, is a visual workflow management method that can be implemented within Agile frameworks or used independently. It originated from Toyota's manufacturing processes and focuses on continuous delivery without fixed-length iterations. Kanban uses a visual board with columns representing different stages of work, allowing teams to see the flow of tasks from "To Do" to "Done" and identify bottlenecks in real-time.

The key differences lie in their structure and approach. Agile works in a push-style where customers are pushing ideas to developers into work queues. Kanban works in a pull-style where developers are pulling ideas from customer work queues. In this way, Agile and Kanban are complementary ways of working.

Both methodologies promote transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Many organizations successfully combine both approaches, using Agile's customer collaboration techniques with Kanban's visual management techniques, to leverage the strengths of both systems for enhanced productivity and quality.
