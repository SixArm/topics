# Agile vs Kanban: Tutorial

## Overview

Agile and Kanban are both widely used methodologies in software engineering for managing and improving development processes, but they operate at different levels and serve different purposes. Agile is a broad philosophy and framework that emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Kanban is a visual workflow management method that focuses on continuous delivery, flow optimization, and work-in-progress control. Kanban can be implemented within Agile frameworks or used independently.

For agile change technology professionals, understanding the relationship between Agile and Kanban is essential for selecting the right approach for different teams and situations, and for effectively combining both when doing so adds value.

## Key Concepts

### Agile as a Philosophy

Agile is an umbrella term encompassing a philosophy, a set of values, and twelve guiding principles articulated in the Agile Manifesto. Agile is not a single prescriptive method but rather a mindset that can be implemented through various frameworks including Scrum, Extreme Programming, Lean, and Kanban itself. Agile emphasizes delivering working software in short iterations, maintaining close customer collaboration, and adapting to changing requirements.

### Kanban as a Visual Workflow Method

Kanban originated from Toyota's manufacturing processes and was adapted for knowledge work, including software development. Its core mechanism is a visual board with columns representing stages of work (such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done"). Work items are represented as cards that move across the board, providing real-time visibility into workflow status and enabling teams to identify and address bottlenecks.

### Push vs. Pull: A Fundamental Difference

One of the most important distinctions between Agile and Kanban lies in how work is initiated:

**Agile (Push Style)**: In typical Agile frameworks, customers and stakeholders push requirements and ideas to development teams, who organize this work into sprints or iterations. The team commits to a batch of work at the beginning of each sprint.

**Kanban (Pull Style)**: In Kanban, developers pull work from a queue when they have capacity. No work is pushed onto team members; instead, they take the next highest-priority item when they finish their current task. This self-regulating mechanism prevents overload and maintains sustainable pace.

These approaches are complementary: Agile's push model ensures customer needs drive the work, while Kanban's pull model ensures the team works at a sustainable, efficient pace.

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits

Kanban introduces explicit WIP limits -- constraints on how many items can be in any workflow stage simultaneously. This mechanism prevents teams from taking on too much work at once, reduces context switching, and forces the resolution of blockers before new work begins. Agile frameworks like Scrum implicitly limit WIP through sprint commitments, but Kanban makes this constraint explicit and continuous.

### Iterations vs. Continuous Flow

Agile frameworks typically organize work into time-boxed iterations (sprints) with defined start and end dates. Kanban operates on a continuous flow model with no fixed iterations. Work is delivered as it is completed, without waiting for a sprint boundary. Both approaches have merits: iterations provide predictable planning cadences, while continuous flow maximizes throughput and minimizes wait times.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

### Step 1: Understand Your Team's Needs

Assess whether your team benefits more from the structured cadence of Agile sprints or the continuous flow of Kanban. Teams with predictable, plannable work may prefer sprint-based Agile. Teams with variable workloads, frequent interruptions, or ongoing maintenance responsibilities may benefit from Kanban's flow model.

### Step 2: Set Up a Kanban Board

Whether you are using Kanban standalone or within an Agile framework, create a visual board that represents your workflow. Define columns for each stage of your process and create cards for each work item. Make the board visible and accessible to all team members.

### Step 3: Establish WIP Limits

Define WIP limits for each column on your board. Start with conservative limits and adjust based on observed throughput. WIP limits are the mechanism that makes Kanban work -- without them, the board is just a visualization tool rather than a flow management system.

### Step 4: Implement Agile Customer Collaboration

Regardless of whether you use sprints or continuous flow, maintain Agile's emphasis on customer collaboration. Regularly demonstrate completed work to stakeholders, gather feedback, and use that feedback to inform prioritization. Agile's customer-centricity and Kanban's flow efficiency are both needed for effective delivery.

### Step 5: Combine Push and Pull

Use Agile's push-style collaboration to gather and prioritize customer requirements into a well-groomed backlog. Then use Kanban's pull-style execution to have team members pull work from the backlog as capacity permits. This combination ensures that customer needs drive the work while the team maintains a sustainable, efficient pace.

### Step 6: Measure Both Agile and Kanban Metrics

Track Agile metrics such as customer satisfaction and feature delivery frequency alongside Kanban metrics such as cycle time, lead time, throughput, and WIP levels. This dual measurement approach gives you visibility into both the value being delivered (Agile focus) and the efficiency of the delivery process (Kanban focus).

### Step 7: Conduct Retrospectives

Use regular retrospectives (an Agile practice) to examine and improve your Kanban process. Review flow metrics, identify recurring bottlenecks, assess whether WIP limits are set appropriately, and agree on process improvements. Continuous improvement is a shared value of both methodologies.

### Step 8: Evolve Your Approach

As your team matures, evolve your approach based on what you learn. Some teams start with Scrum and gradually adopt Kanban practices. Others start with Kanban and add Agile ceremonies as needed. The goal is to find the combination that maximizes value delivery for your specific context.

## Key Takeaway

Agile and Kanban are complementary rather than competing approaches. Agile provides the philosophy, values, and customer collaboration techniques that ensure teams build the right things. Kanban provides the visual management, flow optimization, and WIP control techniques that ensure teams build things efficiently. For agile change professionals, the most effective strategy is often to combine both: using Agile's customer collaboration and iterative mindset to drive what gets built, while using Kanban's visual management and pull-based flow to optimize how it gets built. Understanding both approaches and their complementary strengths enables professionals to design workflows that are both customer-responsive and operationally efficient.
