# Agile principle 9: Continuous attention

"Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."

Technical excellence and good design form the foundation of sustainable agile development, enabling teams to respond quickly to changing requirements while maintaining code quality. When teams prioritize clean, well-structured code, they create systems that are easier to modify, test, and extend.

Consider Netflix's microservices architecture, which exemplifies this principle. By breaking their monolithic system into smaller, well-designed services, they gained the ability to deploy updates independently and scale specific components based on demand. This architectural excellence allows their teams to release new features rapidly without affecting the entire system, demonstrating how good design directly enhances agility.

Another compelling example is Spotify's continuous integration and deployment practices. Their engineering teams invest heavily in automated testing, code reviews, and refactoring. This technical discipline enables them to deploy code changes thousands of times per day while maintaining high reliability. The upfront investment in testing infrastructure and code quality pays dividends in their ability to experiment with new features and respond to user feedback quickly.

Facebook's approach to technical debt management illustrates this principle in practice. They regularly allocate sprint capacity to refactoring and improving existing code, recognizing that neglecting technical excellence would slow down future development. Their "Move Fast and Don't Break Things" philosophy evolved from understanding that speed without quality is ultimately counterproductive.

The principle emphasizes that agility isn't just about moving fastâ€”it's about building systems that can evolve gracefully over time. Teams that cut corners on design and code quality often find themselves slowing down as technical debt accumulates, making simple changes increasingly difficult and time-consuming.
