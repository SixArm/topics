# Agile Principle 9: Continuous Attention

Question: According to Agile Principle 9, why does continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhance agility?

- [ ] It allows teams to skip testing phases and deliver faster
- [ ] It reduces the need for customer feedback during development
- [ ] It creates a foundation that supports rapid iteration by making code easier to modify and extend
- [ ] It eliminates the need for documentation in the development process

  <p>It creates a foundation that supports rapid iteration by making code easier to modify and extend</p>
  <p>Agile Principle 9 asserts that technical excellence and good design directly enable agility rather than hindering it. When teams prioritize clean code, well-structured architectures, and sound design principles, the resulting codebase becomes easier to modify, extend, and debug. This reduces maintenance overhead and allows teams to respond quickly to change. Good design practices like modular architecture isolate changes, preventing ripple effects across the system and maintaining velocity as complexity grows.</p>
