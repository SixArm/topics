# Agile vs Scrumban: Tutorial

## Overview

Agile and Scrumban operate at different levels of specificity within the world of software development methodology. Agile is the overarching philosophy that guides multiple frameworks and practices, emphasizing iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability. Scrumban is a specific hybrid implementation that combines elements of Scrum's structured framework with Kanban's flexible workflow management. Understanding the distinction and relationship between Agile and Scrumban helps professionals select the right approach for their team's unique circumstances.

For agile change technology professionals, Scrumban represents an important option in the methodology toolkit -- particularly for teams in transition, teams with mixed workloads, or organizations seeking evolutionary rather than revolutionary change in their development processes.

## Key Concepts

### Agile as the Guiding Philosophy

Agile provides the foundational values and principles: prioritizing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. Agile methodologies generally provide more prescriptive structures -- Scrum defines specific roles, events, and artifacts; XP prescribes engineering practices; Lean focuses on waste elimination. Each is a distinct implementation of Agile's core philosophy.

### Scrumban as a Hybrid Implementation

Scrumban emerged when teams working with Scrum recognized they needed more flexibility, or when Kanban teams recognized they needed more structure. Scrumban combines:

**From Scrum**:
- Regular planning meetings (though triggered by demand rather than fixed schedules).
- Retrospectives for continuous improvement.
- Sprint concepts (though boundaries are flexible or optional).
- Defined team roles (though often less rigid than in pure Scrum).

**From Kanban**:
- Visual workflow management using Kanban boards.
- Pull-based work assignment (team members pull work as capacity allows).
- Work-in-progress (WIP) limits to prevent bottlenecks and overload.
- Continuous flow rather than strict time-boxed iterations.
- Emphasis on cycle time and throughput metrics.

### Greater Adaptability Than Traditional Agile

While Agile methodologies like Scrum provide structured, prescriptive frameworks, Scrumban offers greater adaptability. The elimination of fixed sprint boundaries allows work to flow more naturally. On-demand planning replaces scheduled sprint planning. WIP limits replace sprint commitments as the primary mechanism for managing workload. This flexibility makes Scrumban particularly effective for teams whose work does not fit neatly into fixed-length iterations.

### Ideal Use Cases for Scrumban

Scrumban is particularly well suited for:

- **Teams transitioning from Scrum to Kanban**: Scrumban provides a gradual migration path, allowing teams to shed Scrum elements incrementally while adopting Kanban practices.
- **Maintenance and support teams**: These teams handle a mix of planned work and unpredictable requests (bug fixes, incidents) that do not fit well into sprint commitments.
- **Teams with unpredictable requirements**: When the nature or volume of incoming work is highly variable, Scrumban's on-demand planning is more effective than fixed sprint planning.
- **Mature teams**: Teams that have mastered Scrum and want to evolve beyond its constraints without losing all structure.

### Evolutionary Change

Scrumban supports evolutionary rather than revolutionary change. Teams do not need to abandon their current practices overnight. Instead, they can gradually adopt Scrumban elements -- adding WIP limits, relaxing sprint boundaries, shifting to on-demand planning -- as their maturity and context dictate.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

### Step 1: Evaluate Your Current State and Pain Points

Assess your team's current methodology and identify specific pain points. Common triggers for considering Scrumban include: sprint commitments that feel artificial, difficulty accommodating urgent work within sprints, excessive ceremony overhead, or a need for more flexibility in planning cadence.

### Step 2: Introduce a Kanban Board

If you are coming from Scrum, add a Kanban board that visualizes your workflow stages. Map your current process from backlog through completion. This board will become the central tool for managing work flow and identifying bottlenecks.

### Step 3: Establish WIP Limits

Set WIP limits for each workflow stage. These limits replace sprint commitments as the primary mechanism for managing team capacity. Start with conservative limits and adjust based on observed throughput and flow.

### Step 4: Shift to On-Demand Planning

Replace fixed sprint planning with on-demand planning triggered by backlog thresholds. Define a trigger point (for example, when the "Ready" column drops below a certain number of items) that initiates a planning session. This ensures the team always has enough prioritized work without the overhead of planning for fixed-length sprints.

### Step 5: Retain Valuable Ceremonies

Keep the Scrum ceremonies that add value and drop those that do not. Most teams retain retrospectives (essential for continuous improvement) and daily standups (essential for coordination). Sprint reviews may evolve into regular stakeholder demonstrations on a flexible schedule rather than at fixed sprint boundaries.

### Step 6: Adopt Flow Metrics

Shift from sprint-based metrics (velocity, sprint burndown) to flow-based metrics (cycle time, lead time, throughput, WIP). These metrics provide more actionable insights in a continuous flow environment and help the team identify and address bottlenecks.

### Step 7: Handle Mixed Workloads

Use Scrumban's flexibility to accommodate both planned features and urgent work. Create swim lanes on your board for different work types (features, bugs, support requests). Apply separate WIP limits to each lane to ensure that urgent work does not crowd out planned development, and vice versa.

### Step 8: Evolve Continuously

Use retrospectives to assess and refine your Scrumban implementation. As the team matures, you may find that some Scrum elements can be dropped entirely, or that additional Kanban practices should be adopted. Scrumban is designed to evolve with the team.

## Key Takeaway

Agile provides the philosophical foundation, and Scrumban provides a pragmatic hybrid implementation that offers more flexibility than Scrum and more structure than Kanban. For agile change professionals, Scrumban is an excellent choice for teams that need to evolve their practices gradually, handle mixed or unpredictable workloads, or move beyond the constraints of strict sprint-based development. The key to success is maintaining discipline around WIP limits and planning triggers while embracing the flexibility of continuous flow. Scrumban represents evolutionary change -- meeting teams where they are and helping them progress at a sustainable pace toward more effective delivery. The choice between broader Agile methodologies and Scrumban ultimately depends on team maturity, project characteristics, and organizational constraints.
