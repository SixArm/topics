  <p>It combines Scrum's structured ceremonies with Kanban's pull-based system and work-in-progress limits</p>
  <p>Scrumban is a hybrid approach that retains beneficial Scrum elements like sprints and retrospectives while incorporating Kanban's continuous flow, visual management, pull-based system, and work-in-progress limits. This creates a more adaptable framework that offers greater flexibility than pure Scrum while maintaining more structure than pure Kanban—making it ideal for maintenance teams, support organizations, or projects with unpredictable requirements.</p>
