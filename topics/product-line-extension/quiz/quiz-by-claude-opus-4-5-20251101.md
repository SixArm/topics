  <p>To expand offerings within an existing product line to serve different customer needs while leveraging existing brand equity</p>
  <p>Product line extension involves introducing additional products or variations within an existing product line—such as new variants, packaging options, features, or targeted offerings—to cater to different customer preferences and market segments. The key advantage is that it leverages the company's existing brand equity, customer base, and distribution channels rather than starting from scratch in a new market.</p>
