  <p>Business architecture, information architecture, technology architecture, and application architecture</p>
  <p>Enterprise Architecture is structured around four key domains: Business architecture (covering business processes, organization structure, and operational goals), Information architecture (covering data assets, information flows, and information systems), Technology architecture (covering hardware, software, and network infrastructure), and Application architecture (covering software applications and how they support business processes and information flows). Understanding these four domains is essential for aligning an organization's IT capabilities with its strategic goals.</p>
