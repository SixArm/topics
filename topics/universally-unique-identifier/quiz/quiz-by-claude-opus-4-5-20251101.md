# Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)

Question: What is a primary advantage of using UUIDs as database primary keys instead of auto-incrementing integers?

- [ ] UUIDs require less storage space than integers
- [ ] UUIDs can be generated independently across distributed systems without risk of key collisions
- [ ] UUIDs are easier for humans to read and remember
- [ ] UUIDs automatically enforce referential integrity

  <p>UUIDs can be generated independently across distributed systems without risk of key collisions</p>
  <p>Because UUIDs are 128-bit identifiers designed to be globally unique, they can be generated by different systems or nodes without any centralized coordination. This makes them ideal for distributed database systems where multiple nodes need to create records simultaneously without communicating with each other to avoid duplicate primary keys.</p>
