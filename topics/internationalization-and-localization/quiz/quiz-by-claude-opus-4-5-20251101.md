# Internationalization and localization

Question: What is the primary distinction between internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in software development?

- [ ] Internationalization translates content into multiple languages, while localization designs the software architecture
- [ ] Internationalization designs software to be easily adapted for different regions, while localization adapts it for a specific region
- [ ] Internationalization handles currency conversion, while localization handles date formatting
- [ ] Internationalization and localization are interchangeable terms for the same process

  <p>Internationalization designs software to be easily adapted for different regions, while localization adapts it for a specific region</p>
  <p>Internationalization (i18n) is the process of designing software so it can be easily localized—separating UI text from code, handling regional settings properly, and supporting various character sets. Localization (l10n) is the subsequent process of actually translating and adapting that software for a specific language, culture, or region. In short, internationalization makes software ready for localization, while localization adapts it for a particular audience.</p>
