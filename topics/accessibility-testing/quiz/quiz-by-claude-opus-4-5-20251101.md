  <p>WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)</p>
  <p>WCAG is the most widely adopted international standard for web accessibility. Developed by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), it provides specific technical guidelines organized around four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR). While the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are important U.S. laws that mandate accessibility, they typically reference WCAG as the technical standard for compliance. Technology professionals should be familiar with WCAG levels (A, AA, AAA) as most organizations target WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.</p>
