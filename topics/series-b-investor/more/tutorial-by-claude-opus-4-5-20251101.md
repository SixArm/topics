## Series B Investor

A Series B investor is a venture capital firm, institutional investor, or sophisticated individual that provides funding during a company's Series B financing round. This stage represents a critical inflection point where startups transition from proving their concept to aggressively scaling their operations.

## Where Series B Fits in the Funding Lifecycle

Series B funding occurs after a company has successfully navigated earlier stages and demonstrated meaningful traction.

| Funding Stage | Typical Purpose | Usual Investment Range | Company Maturity |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Pre-Seed | Validate idea, build MVP | $50K - $500K | Concept stage |
| Seed | Product development, initial hiring | $500K - $3M | Early product |
| Series A | Product-market fit, initial scaling | $3M - $15M | Revenue generating |
| Series B | Aggressive scaling, market expansion | $15M - $50M+ | Proven business model |
| Series C+ | Market dominance, M&A, IPO prep | $50M - $200M+ | Mature operations |

## What Series B Investors Look For

Series B investors have specific criteria that distinguish them from earlier-stage investors:

- **Market traction**: Significant user growth, revenue growth, or both
- **Experienced management team**: Leadership capable of scaling from tens to hundreds of employees
- **Large addressable market**: Opportunity to build a billion-dollar company
- **Competitive moat**: Defensible advantages that protect against competitors
