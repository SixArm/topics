  <p>To scale the business, expand operations, and accelerate growth</p>
  <p>Series B funding occurs after a company has already proven its business model and gained market traction through seed and Series A rounds. At this stage, the company seeks capital specifically to scale operations, expand into new markets, and accelerate growth—not to develop initial products or fund exits.</p>
