  <p>To enable machines to understand and interpret web content meaningfully</p>
  <p>The semantic web extends the World Wide Web by adding metadata to web resources in a structured and standardized way, using standards like RDF, OWL, and SPARQL. This allows computers to process, share, and integrate information across different applications and domains by focusing on the meaning (semantics) of data rather than just its syntax or structure.</p>
