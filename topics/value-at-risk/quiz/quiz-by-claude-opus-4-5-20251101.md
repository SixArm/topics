  <p>There is a 5% probability of experiencing losses greater than $1 million over one day</p>
  <p>VaR at a given confidence level represents the threshold loss that will only be exceeded with the remaining probability. A 95% confidence level means there is a 5% chance (100% - 95%) that losses will exceed the VaR amount over the specified time horizon. This is a critical concept for technology professionals working on risk management systems, financial applications, or data analytics platforms.</p>
