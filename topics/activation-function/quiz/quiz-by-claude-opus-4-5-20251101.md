# Activation function

Question: What is the primary purpose of an activation function in an artificial neural network?

- [ ] To reduce the number of parameters in the model
- [ ] To introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns
- [ ] To speed up the training process by simplifying calculations
- [ ] To normalize the input data before processing

  <p>To introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns</p>
  <p>An activation function introduces non-linearity into a neural network. Without activation functions, the network would behave as a linear model regardless of the number of layers, severely limiting its ability to learn and approximate complex, nonlinear relationships in data. This non-linearity is what allows deep neural networks to model sophisticated patterns and solve complex problems.</p>
