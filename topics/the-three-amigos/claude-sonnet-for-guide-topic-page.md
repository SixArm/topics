# The Three Amigos

The Three Amigos is a collaborative practice in agile software development that brings together three key perspectives to ensure comprehensive understanding of user stories and requirements. This approach involves a business analyst, developer, and tester working together during the early stages of feature development, typically before implementation begins.

The business analyst represents the business perspective, focusing on what needs to be built and why, meaning what delivers value to customers. The developer brings the technical viewpoint, considering how the feature will be implemented, potential technical constraints, and architectural implications. The tester contributes the quality assurance perspective, thinking about edge cases, potential failure scenarios, and how the feature will be validated.

During Three Amigos sessions, the team examines user stories collaboratively, discussing acceptance criteria, identifying ambiguities, and exploring different scenarios. This conversation helps uncover assumptions, clarify requirements, and identify potential issues before development starts. The practice often involves creating examples and discussing "what if" scenarios to ensure everyone shares the same understanding.

The primary benefits include reduced rework, fewer defects, improved communication, and faster delivery. By involving all three perspectives early, teams can identify and resolve misunderstandings before they become expensive to fix. The practice also promotes shared ownership of quality and helps break down silos between different roles.

Three Amigos sessions typically last 30-60 minutes and can be conducted for each user story or grouped stories. The practice works well with behavior-driven development and acceptance test-driven development approaches, as the conversations often naturally lead to defining concrete examples and acceptance tests that guide implementation and verification.
