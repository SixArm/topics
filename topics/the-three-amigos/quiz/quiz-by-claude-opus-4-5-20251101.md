  <p>Business analyst, developer, and tester</p>
  <p>The Three Amigos brings together three key perspectives: the business analyst (representing business needs and customer value), the developer (providing technical viewpoint on implementation and constraints), and the tester (contributing quality assurance perspective on edge cases and validation). This collaboration helps uncover assumptions, clarify requirements, and identify potential issues before development starts, resulting in reduced rework and fewer defects.</p>
