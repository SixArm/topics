# Agile design patterns

Question: Which design pattern is most valuable for supporting agile's emphasis on testability and adaptability by allowing components to be easily mocked during unit testing and swapped when requirements change?

- [ ] Observer pattern
- [ ] Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
- [ ] Dependency Injection
- [ ] Adapter pattern

  <p>Dependency Injection</p>
  <p>Dependency Injection promotes testability and flexibility, which are core agile values. By injecting dependencies rather than hard-coding them, developers can easily mock components for unit testing and adapt to changing requirements. This pattern is fundamental to writing loosely coupled, maintainable code that can evolve rapidly during agile development cycles.</p>
