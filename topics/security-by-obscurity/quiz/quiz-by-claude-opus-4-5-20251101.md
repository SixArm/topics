  <p>It provides a false sense of security without addressing underlying vulnerabilities</p>
  <p>Security by obscurity may make a system appear secure, but it does not fix actual security weaknesses. Determined attackers can often find ways to bypass obscurity-based defenses. Security experts recommend using robust measures like encryption, access control, and threat monitoring alongside any obscurity measures for comprehensive protection.</p>
