# Resource Description Framework (RDF)

Question: What is the fundamental structure that RDF uses to describe resources and their relationships?

- [ ] Key-value pairs consisting of a name and a value
- [ ] Relational tables with rows and columns
- [ ] Triples consisting of a subject, predicate, and object
- [ ] Binary trees with parent and child nodes

  <p>Triples consisting of a subject, predicate, and object</p>
  <p>RDF uses triples as its core vocabulary structure. Each triple contains a subject (the resource being described), a predicate (the relationship), and an object (the resource or value that the relationship describes). This triple-based structure allows RDF to represent information as a graph where nodes are resources identified by URIs and edges represent relationships between them.</p>
