  <p>The owner is personally liable for all business debts and legal issues, putting personal assets at risk</p>
  <p>In a sole proprietorship, there is no legal separation between the owner and the business. This means the owner's personal assets (home, car, savings) can be seized to satisfy business debts or legal judgments. This unlimited personal liability is the most critical consideration for technology professionals choosing a business structure, especially when providing services where errors could result in lawsuits. Other structures like LLCs and corporations provide liability protection that shields personal assets from business risks.</p>
