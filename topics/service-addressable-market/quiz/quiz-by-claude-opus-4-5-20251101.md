  <p>The portion of the total market a company can realistically target and serve with its offerings</p>
  <p>SAM is a subset of the Total Addressable Market (TAM) that represents the specific market segments a company can actually reach and serve based on factors such as geography, industry focus, customer demographics, and the company's capabilities. Unlike TAM, which represents the entire market opportunity, SAM helps companies focus their resources on the most promising and achievable market segments.</p>
