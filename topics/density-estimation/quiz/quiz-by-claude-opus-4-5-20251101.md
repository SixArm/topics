# Density estimation

Question: What is the primary purpose of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) compared to using a basic histogram?

- [ ] To reduce the number of data points needed for analysis
- [ ] To automatically identify the optimal number of bins
- [ ] To smooth the distribution by placing kernels on each data point
- [ ] To convert continuous data into discrete categories

  <p>To smooth the distribution by placing kernels on each data point</p>
  <p>Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) improves upon histograms by placing a kernel function (typically Gaussian) on each data point and summing these kernels together. This produces a smooth, continuous probability density function rather than the stepped, discrete representation that histograms provide. This smoothing helps reveal the underlying shape of the distribution more accurately and eliminates the sensitivity to bin size and placement that can significantly affect histogram appearance.</p>
