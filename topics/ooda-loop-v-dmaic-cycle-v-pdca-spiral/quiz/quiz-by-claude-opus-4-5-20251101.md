# OODA loop v DMAIC cycle v PDCA spiral

Question: Which statement best describes the key difference between OODA, DMAIC, and PDCA frameworks?

- [ ] PDCA originated from military strategy while OODA was developed for business process improvement
- [ ] OODA is designed for competitive/adversarial strategy, DMAIC for Six Sigma process optimization, and PDCA for iterative improvement spirals
- [ ] All three frameworks are identical in purpose and were developed for manufacturing quality control
- [ ] DMAIC is the only framework that includes a measurement phase

  <p>OODA is designed for competitive/adversarial strategy, DMAIC for Six Sigma process optimization, and PDCA for iterative improvement spirals</p>
  <p>Each framework serves a distinct primary purpose: OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) originated from U.S. military planning to defeat adversaries and is used for competitive strategy; DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) is the core tool for driving Six Sigma projects focused on optimizing business processes; and PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) is an iterative improvement cycle that converges toward goals through successive spirals of increasing knowledge.</p>
