  <p>Agile is an umbrella framework providing principles, while XP is a specific implementation with concrete engineering practices</p>
  <p>The relationship between Agile and XP is hierarchical rather than competitive. Agile provides the philosophical foundation through its four core values and twelve principles, while XP translates these principles into concrete, immediately implementable practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, refactoring, and collective code ownership. XP distinguishes itself through its emphasis on technical excellence and engineering discipline.</p>
