# Agile vs Extreme Programming (XP)

Agile and Extreme Programming (XP) are related methodologies in software development, with XP being one of the most prominent implementations of Agile principles. Agile serves as an umbrella framework emphasizing iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability to change, while XP represents a specific set of practices designed to achieve these goals through disciplined engineering techniques.

The relationship between them is hierarchical rather than competitive. Agile provides the philosophical foundation through its four core values and twelve principles, focusing on individuals over processes, working software over documentation, customer collaboration over contracts, and responding to change over rigid planning. XP takes these principles and translates them into concrete practices that development teams can implement immediately.

XP distinguishes itself through its emphasis on technical excellence and engineering discipline. While other Agile methodologies like Scrum focus primarily on project management and team organization, XP prescribes specific development practices including pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, refactoring, and collective code ownership. These practices are designed to improve code quality, reduce defects, and enable rapid response to changing requirements.

Both approaches share common goals of delivering value quickly, maintaining high quality, and fostering collaboration. Teams often combine elements from both, using Scrum's organizational structure while adopting XP's technical practices to create a comprehensive development approach that addresses both project management and engineering excellence.
