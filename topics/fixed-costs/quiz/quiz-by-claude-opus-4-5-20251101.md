  <p>They remain constant regardless of production or sales levels</p>
  <p>Fixed costs are expenses that do not vary with changes in production or sales volume. Examples include rent, salaries, insurance premiums, and property taxes. These costs must be paid regardless of whether the business produces one unit or one million units, making them critical to understand when calculating break-even points and managing cash flow.</p>
