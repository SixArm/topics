  <p>Identity management, authentication, authorization, and auditing</p>
  <p>Access control systems use these four complementary techniques: identity management ensures only authorized users exist in the system, authentication verifies user identity, authorization determines what actions authenticated users can perform based on roles and permissions, and auditing tracks and monitors access to detect unauthorized activity or security breaches.</p>
