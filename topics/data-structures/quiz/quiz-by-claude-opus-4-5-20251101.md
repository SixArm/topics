  <p>Stack</p>
  <p>A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. This is in contrast to a queue, which uses First-In-First-Out (FIFO) ordering. Understanding this distinction is essential for technology professionals when choosing the appropriate data structure for algorithms involving undo operations, function call management, expression parsing, and backtracking scenarios.</p>
