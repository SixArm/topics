# Unsupervised learning

Question: What is the primary objective of unsupervised learning in machine learning?

- [ ] To predict specific output labels using labeled training data
- [ ] To find patterns, structures, or representations in data without explicit labels
- [ ] To optimize a reward signal through trial and error interactions
- [ ] To generate synthetic data by copying existing labeled examples

  <p>To find patterns, structures, or representations in data without explicit labels</p>
  <p>Unsupervised learning is trained on datasets without explicit labels or target outputs. Unlike supervised learning which uses labeled data, unsupervised learning algorithms explore data to identify inherent patterns, structures, or representations without guidance on what to look for. Common tasks include clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and density estimation.</p>
