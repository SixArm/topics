  <p>Members' personal assets are protected from the company's legal liabilities</p>
  <p>Limited liability protection is the key distinguishing feature of an LLC. Unlike sole proprietorships and partnerships where owners' personal assets (homes, cars, savings) are at risk if the business faces lawsuits or bankruptcy, an LLC shields members' personal assets—only the company's assets are at risk. This protection, combined with flexible management and pass-through taxation, makes LLCs a popular choice for entrepreneurs.</p>
