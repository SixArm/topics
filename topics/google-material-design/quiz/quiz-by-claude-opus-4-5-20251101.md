  <p>To represent a tangible surface for user interactions using depth, shadows, and animations</p>
  <p>The Material Metaphor is a foundational principle of Google Material Design that creates a sense of physicality in digital interfaces. By using depth, shadows, and animations, it establishes visual hierarchy and helps users understand how elements can be interacted with, making the interface feel more intuitive and responsive to touch or motion.</p>
