# Agile manifesto 2: Working software

"Working software over comprehensive documentation"

This point emphasizes that functional, tested software should take precedence over exhaustive written specifications and process documents.

Traditional software development methodologies often required extensive upfront documentation, including detailed requirements specifications and comprehensive technical manuals. While these documents served important purposes, they frequently became outdated quickly as projects evolved, consuming time and resources better spent on actual development.

The Agile approach recognizes that working software provides immediate value to users and stakeholders. A functioning prototype or increment can demonstrate capabilities, reveal requirements gaps, and generate feedback more effectively than lengthy written descriptions. This tangible output allows teams to validate assumptions early and make necessary adjustments before investing heavily in potentially incorrect directions.

However, this principle requires balance and context. Some documentation remains essential, particularly for complex systems, regulatory compliance, or knowledge transfer. The key is determining what documentation truly adds value versus what exists merely to satisfy process requirements. Agile teams focus on creating "just enough" documentationâ€”sufficient to support development, maintenance, and user adoption without becoming a burden.

Modern practices like self-documenting code, automated testing, and collaborative tools help maintain necessary information without traditional heavy documentation. By prioritizing working software, teams can deliver value faster, respond to change more effectively, and maintain focus on what matters most: helping users.
