  <p>Functional, tested software should take precedence over exhaustive written specifications</p>
  <p>This Agile principle recognizes that working software provides immediate value to users and stakeholders, allowing teams to validate assumptions early through tangible output rather than lengthy written descriptions. However, it does not mean eliminating all documentation—Agile teams focus on creating "just enough" documentation that truly adds value without becoming a burden.</p>
