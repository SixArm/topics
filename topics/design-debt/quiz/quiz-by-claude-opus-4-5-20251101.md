  <p>The accumulation of suboptimal design choices that impact user experience and may need future correction</p>
  <p>Design debt (also known as UX debt or experience debt) occurs when shortcuts or compromises are made during the design process due to time constraints, budget limitations, changing requirements, or lack of user research. This leads to usability issues, inconsistencies, or inefficiencies that need to be addressed later. Addressing design debt is important to maintain a high-quality user experience and avoid long-term negative impacts on the product, typically through usability testing, user research, and design audits.</p>
