# Object database

Question: What is the primary advantage of using an object database for object-oriented programming applications?

- [ ] It uses SQL as its native query language for maximum compatibility
- [ ] It requires less storage space than relational databases
- [ ] It allows objects to be stored directly in their native form, simplifying programming
- [ ] It automatically converts objects to relational tables for faster queries

  <p>It allows objects to be stored directly in their native form, simplifying programming</p>
  <p>Object databases store data as objects rather than in tables, which aligns naturally with object-oriented programming. This eliminates the need for object-relational mapping (ORM) and allows complex objects to be stored and retrieved in their native form, making development more straightforward for OOP applications.</p>
