  <p>Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that addresses the main pain point of your target customer</p>
  <p>Building an MVP allows startups to quickly validate their core value proposition with limited resources. By focusing on the main feature needed to address the primary pain point, teams can gather feedback from early adopters, iterate rapidly based on real user data, and make informed decisions about whether to pivot or refine the product before investing significant resources in full-scale development.</p>
