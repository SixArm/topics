  <p>To prevent team overwhelm and improve completion speed and efficiency</p>
  <p>Limiting work in progress (WIP) is one of the key principles of Kanban. By restricting how much work is active at any given time, teams avoid becoming overwhelmed, reduce context switching, and ensure that tasks move through the workflow more quickly. This constraint helps identify bottlenecks early and promotes a steady, sustainable flow of completed work.</p>
