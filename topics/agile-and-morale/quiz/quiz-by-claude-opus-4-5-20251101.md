  <p>Cultural change that embraces uncertainty, welcomes feedback, and supports collaborative problem-solving</p>
  <p>Successful agile implementation requires cultural change beyond process adoption. When organizations fail to support these cultural shifts—including psychological safety, leadership commitment, and willingness to experiment and learn from failures—agile practices can become mere ceremony without delivering the intended benefits of improved morale and productivity.</p>
