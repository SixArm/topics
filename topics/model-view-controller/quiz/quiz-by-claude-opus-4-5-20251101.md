  <p>Controller</p>
  <p>The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View components. It handles user input, processes it, manipulates the data in the Model, and updates the View accordingly. The Controller is responsible for maintaining the flow of data and interactions between the Model (data/business logic) and View (presentation layer).</p>
