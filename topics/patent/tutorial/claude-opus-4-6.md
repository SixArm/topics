# Patent

A patent is a legal instrument of intellectual property law that grants an inventor the exclusive right to make, use, sell, and import their invention for a limited period, typically 20 years from the filing date of the patent application. Patents serve as a social contract: the inventor publicly discloses the technical details of their invention in exchange for a temporary monopoly on its commercial exploitation. For technology professionals, patents are a critical mechanism for protecting innovations, establishing competitive advantage, and generating revenue through licensing.

## How Patents Work

The patent system is built on the principle of disclosure. When an inventor files a patent application, they must describe the invention in sufficient detail that someone skilled in the relevant field could reproduce it. In return, the government grants the inventor a time-limited exclusive right to control how the invention is used commercially. Once the patent expires, the invention enters the public domain and anyone may freely use it.

A patent does not grant the holder the right to practice the invention; it grants the right to exclude others from doing so. This distinction matters because a patented invention may still require licenses under other patents, or may be subject to regulatory approval before it can be brought to market.

## Types of Patents

There are three primary types of patents recognized by most patent offices around the world, each covering a different category of innovation.

| Type | What It Protects | Duration | Examples |
|------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Utility Patent | New and useful processes, machines, articles of manufacture, compositions of matter | 20 years from filing | Software algorithms, pharmaceutical compounds, semiconductor fabrication processes |
| Design Patent | Ornamental design or appearance of a functional item | 15 years from grant (US) | Shape of a smartphone, icon design, graphical user interface layout |
| Plant Patent | New varieties of plants that are asexually reproduced | 20 years from filing | Hybrid crop varieties, new ornamental plant cultivars |

Utility patents are by far the most common and most relevant to technology professionals. They cover the functional aspects of an invention, whether it is a novel data compression method, a new type of battery chemistry, or an improved manufacturing process.

## Requirements for Patentability

To be granted a patent, an invention must satisfy several legal criteria. These requirements vary slightly between jurisdictions but share a common foundation.

- **Novelty**: The invention must be new. It cannot have been previously disclosed in any publication, public use, or prior patent filing anywhere in the world. A single prior disclosure, known as prior art, can defeat a patent application.
- **Non-Obviousness (Inventive Step)**: The invention must not be an obvious extension of existing knowledge to a person of ordinary skill in the relevant technical field. Combining known elements in a predictable way generally does not meet this threshold.
- **Utility (Industrial Applicability)**: The invention must have a specific, substantial, and credible use. Abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena are not patentable on their own.
- **Sufficient Disclosure**: The patent application must describe the invention clearly and completely enough to enable someone skilled in the field to reproduce it. This is known as the enablement requirement.
- **Patentable Subject Matter**: The invention must fall within the categories of patentable subject matter defined by law. In many jurisdictions, mathematical formulas, abstract business methods, and purely mental processes are excluded.

## The Patent Application Process

The patent application process is multi-stage and typically takes several years from initial filing to grant.

1. **Prior Art Search**: Before filing, an inventor or their patent attorney conducts a search of existing patents, publications, and products to determine whether the invention is truly novel.
2. **Provisional Application (Optional)**: In the United States, inventors may file a provisional patent application to establish an early filing date. This grants 12 months to file a full non-provisional application.
3. **Non-Provisional Application**: The formal application includes a detailed written specification, drawings (if applicable), and one or more claims that define the legal scope of protection sought.
4. **Examination**: A patent examiner reviews the application against the requirements for patentability. The examiner may issue office actions raising objections or rejections, which the applicant must address through amendments or arguments.
5. **Grant or Rejection**: If the examiner is satisfied that all requirements are met, the patent is granted. If not, the applicant may appeal the decision.
6. **Maintenance**: After grant, patent holders must pay periodic maintenance fees to keep the patent in force.

## Patents in the Technology Industry

Patents play a particularly significant role in the technology sector, where innovation cycles are rapid and competitive pressures are intense.

- **Defensive Portfolios**: Many large technology companies build extensive patent portfolios not primarily to enforce their patents, but to deter competitors from filing infringement suits. A strong portfolio provides leverage for cross-licensing negotiations.
- **Standards-Essential Patents**: When patented technology becomes part of an industry standard (such as wireless communication protocols), the patent holder is typically required to license it on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
- **Patent Trolls (Non-Practicing Entities)**: Some entities acquire patents solely to assert them against operating companies for licensing fees or litigation settlements, without ever manufacturing or selling products based on the patents. This practice is controversial and has prompted legislative and judicial reforms.
- **Open Source Considerations**: Patents can create tension with open-source software development. Some organizations, such as the Open Invention Network, pool patents defensively to protect open-source ecosystems.
- **Software Patents**: The patentability of software varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, software-implemented inventions may be patentable if they are tied to a concrete technical improvement, though the boundaries remain an area of active litigation.

## International Patent Considerations

Patents are territorial: a patent granted in one country provides no protection in another. Inventors seeking international protection must file in each country or region where they want coverage.

| Mechanism | Description | Coverage |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) | A single international application that preserves filing rights in over 150 countries for up to 30 months | Global (but must enter national phase in each country) |
| European Patent Convention (EPC) | A centralized examination process for European patents | 39 European states |
| Direct National Filing | Filing separately in each country's patent office | Individual country |

The PCT process does not result in an "international patent." Rather, it streamlines the initial filing and examination process, giving inventors more time to decide which national markets justify the expense of full prosecution.

## Costs and Strategic Considerations

Obtaining and maintaining patents is expensive. Technology professionals and organizations must weigh the costs against the strategic value of patent protection.

- **Filing and Prosecution Costs**: A single US utility patent typically costs between $10,000 and $25,000 in attorney fees and filing fees, and significantly more for complex inventions or contested examinations.
- **International Costs**: Pursuing international protection through the PCT and subsequent national filings can multiply total costs to $100,000 or more per invention.
- **Maintenance Fees**: Annual or periodic fees are required to keep patents in force. In the US, maintenance fees are due at 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years after grant.
- **Enforcement Costs**: Patent litigation in the United States is extraordinarily expensive, with median costs for a high-stakes case exceeding $3 million through trial.
- **Trade Secrets as an Alternative**: For some inventions, particularly those that are difficult to reverse-engineer, maintaining the invention as a trade secret may be more cost-effective than patenting it.

Technology professionals working with patents should also explore related topics including intellectual property law more broadly, trade secrets, copyright, trademark, licensing agreements, non-disclosure agreements, open-source licensing, standards-essential patents, and the intersection of artificial intelligence with patent law, particularly regarding AI-generated inventions and the use of AI tools in prior art searches.

## Summary

A patent is a powerful but complex legal tool that grants inventors a time-limited exclusive right to their inventions in exchange for public disclosure. For technology professionals, understanding the patent system is essential for protecting innovations, navigating competitive landscapes, building defensive portfolios, and making informed strategic decisions about when to patent, when to publish, and when to rely on alternative forms of protection such as trade secrets. The process is costly and time-consuming, but a well-managed patent strategy can provide significant competitive and financial advantages.
