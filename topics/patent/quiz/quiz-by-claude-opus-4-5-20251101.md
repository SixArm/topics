  <p>Novel, non-obvious, and useful</p>
  <p>To obtain a patent, an inventor must demonstrate that their invention meets three fundamental criteria: it must be novel (new and not previously known), non-obvious (not an evident improvement that any skilled person would make), and useful (it must have practical utility). These requirements are evaluated by the patent office when reviewing a patent application.</p>
