  <p>To verify actual results match expected outcomes at specific moments during execution</p>
  <p>A checkpoint is a verification point where an automated test script pauses to compare actual results with expected outcomes. Checkpoints serve as quality gates that determine whether a test should continue or fail based on predefined criteria, ensuring the application under test is behaving correctly at specific moments during execution.</p>
