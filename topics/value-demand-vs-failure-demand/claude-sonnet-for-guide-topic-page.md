# Value demand vs failure demand

In agile software engineering and change management, understanding the distinction between value demand and failure demand is crucial for optimizing development processes and resource allocation.

Value demand represents work that directly contributes to customer satisfaction, business objectives, or system improvement. This includes developing new features, enhancing user experience, implementing requested functionality, or addressing genuine business needs. When teams focus on value demand, they create tangible benefits that users recognize and appreciate.

Failure demand consists of work generated by failures in the system, process, or previous deliveries. This encompasses bug fixes, rework due to inadequate requirements gathering, addressing technical debt, resolving performance issues, or handling customer complaints stemming from system deficiencies. While necessary, failure demand consumes resources without adding new value and often indicates underlying problems in development practices or system architecture.

Agile methodologies aim to maximize value demand while minimizing failure demand through practices like continuous integration, automated testing, regular retrospectives, and iterative feedback loops. By identifying and addressing root causes of failure demand, teams can redirect their efforts toward value-creating activities. For example, investing in better automated testing infrastructure may initially seem like overhead but ultimately reduces future bug-fixing efforts.

Measuring the ratio between value and failure demand provides insights into team efficiency and system health. High failure demand ratios suggest process improvements are needed, while increasing value demand ratios indicate effective agile practices. Organizations should track these metrics to make informed decisions about where to invest development time and identify opportunities for process optimization.
