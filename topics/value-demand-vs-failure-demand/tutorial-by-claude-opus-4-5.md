# Value Demand vs. Failure Demand: Tutorial

## Overview

Understanding the distinction between value demand and failure demand is one of the most important analytical tools available to agile change professionals. Originating from John Seddon's work on the Vanguard Method and systems thinking, this concept provides a powerful lens for evaluating how organizations spend their resources, identifying systemic waste, and focusing improvement efforts where they will have the greatest impact. In agile software engineering and change management, applying this distinction helps teams redirect effort from reactive firefighting toward proactive value creation.

## Key Concepts

### Value Demand

Value demand represents work that directly contributes to customer satisfaction, business objectives, or system improvement. This is the work the organization exists to do. Examples include developing new features that address genuine customer needs, enhancing user experience based on feedback, implementing requested functionality, improving system performance to meet user expectations, or addressing genuine business requirements.

When teams focus on value demand, they create tangible benefits that users recognize and appreciate. Value demand is the work that justifies the organization's existence and creates competitive advantage.

### Failure Demand

Failure demand consists of work generated by failures in the system, process, or previous deliveries. This is preventable work that consumes resources without adding new value. Examples include fixing bugs from previous releases, reworking features due to inadequate requirements gathering, addressing technical debt that impairs system function, resolving performance issues caused by architectural shortcomings, handling customer complaints stemming from system deficiencies, and supporting workarounds for known limitations.

While failure demand work is often necessary in the short term, it represents systemic waste. Every hour spent on failure demand is an hour not spent on creating new value. High levels of failure demand indicate underlying problems in development practices, system architecture, or organizational processes.

### The Ratio as a Diagnostic Tool

Measuring the ratio between value demand and failure demand provides critical insights into team efficiency and system health. A high proportion of failure demand signals that the team is spending most of its energy compensating for systemic problems rather than creating new value. Conversely, an increasing proportion of value demand indicates that the team's agile practices are effectively reducing waste and enabling value creation.

### Root Cause Orientation

The most important aspect of this framework is its emphasis on addressing root causes. Rather than simply allocating more resources to handle failure demand, effective teams trace failure demand back to its origins and invest in eliminating the conditions that produce it. This transforms the team's capacity over time, freeing increasingly more resources for value-creating work.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Categorize all incoming work.** For a defined period (at least two to four weeks), categorize every work item the team handles as either value demand or failure demand. Be honest and rigorous in the classification -- the goal is an accurate picture, not a flattering one.

2. **Calculate the current ratio.** Determine what percentage of total team effort goes to value demand versus failure demand. In many organizations, the results are surprising -- failure demand often consumes 40-70% of total capacity.

3. **Analyze failure demand by category.** Break down failure demand into categories: bugs, rework, technical debt remediation, customer escalations, workarounds, and so on. Identify which categories consume the most resources.

4. **Trace root causes.** For each major category of failure demand, investigate the systemic root cause. Why do these bugs occur? What about the requirements process leads to rework? Why has technical debt accumulated? What system design decisions produce customer complaints?

5. **Prioritize root cause investment.** Based on your analysis, identify the root causes that, if addressed, would eliminate the largest volumes of failure demand. These represent high-leverage improvement opportunities.

6. **Invest in failure demand prevention.** Allocate dedicated capacity for addressing root causes. This may include improving automated testing infrastructure, enhancing requirements gathering practices, paying down critical technical debt, redesigning system architecture, or improving communication channels with customers.

7. **Build prevention into your process.** Integrate practices that prevent failure demand from arising in the first place. Continuous integration, automated testing, regular retrospectives, iterative feedback loops, and definition-of-done standards all serve to prevent failure demand at the source.

8. **Track the ratio over time.** Monitor the value-to-failure demand ratio as a key health metric. Plot it over weeks and months to observe trends. A healthy agile organization should see failure demand decreasing and value demand capacity increasing over time.

9. **Use the ratio in planning.** When planning sprints or iterations, explicitly account for the current failure demand load. This creates transparency about true capacity for value creation and prevents unrealistic commitments.

10. **Communicate the concept broadly.** Share the value demand vs. failure demand framework with stakeholders, product owners, and leadership. When stakeholders understand that reducing failure demand frees capacity for new features, they become allies in investment decisions that prioritize systemic improvement.

11. **Resist the temptation to optimize failure demand handling.** It can be tempting to make failure demand processing more efficient -- faster bug fixing, streamlined rework processes. While this helps in the short term, the strategic goal is to eliminate the conditions that create failure demand, not to become faster at handling it.

## Key Takeaway

The central lesson of the value demand vs. failure demand distinction for agile change professionals is that organizational capacity is finite, and every unit of effort spent on failure demand is a unit unavailable for creating new value. By rigorously measuring the ratio between the two, tracing failure demand to its root causes, and investing in systemic prevention, teams can progressively shift their effort from reactive waste-handling to proactive value creation. This is not a one-time fix but an ongoing discipline -- and it is one of the most powerful levers available for improving team effectiveness, system health, and customer satisfaction.
