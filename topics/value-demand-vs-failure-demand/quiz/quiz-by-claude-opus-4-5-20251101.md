  <p>Value demand directly contributes to customer satisfaction and business objectives, while failure demand is work generated by system failures or deficiencies</p>
  <p>Value demand represents work that creates tangible benefits users recognize—such as new features, enhanced user experience, and requested functionality. Failure demand encompasses work caused by failures like bug fixes, rework, technical debt, and resolving issues from system deficiencies. Understanding this distinction helps teams optimize resource allocation by maximizing value-creating activities and minimizing work that consumes resources without adding new value.</p>
