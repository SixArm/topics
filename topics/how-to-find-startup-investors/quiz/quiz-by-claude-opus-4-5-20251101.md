  <p>Demonstrate traction before approaching VCs, as they typically invest in startups with a proven track record</p>
  <p>Venture capital firms usually invest in startups that have demonstrated success and growth potential. Before approaching VCs, founders should show some traction—such as user growth, revenue, or product-market fit—to increase their chances of securing funding. This differentiates VC investment from angel investing, which often supports earlier-stage companies.</p>
