Your network is your most valuable asset when fundraising. Investors prefer warm introductions over cold outreach.

- Industry-specific gatherings
- Demo days and pitch competitions

**Build relationships before you need them:**
- Connect with investors on LinkedIn
- Engage with their content thoughtfully
- Attend their office hours or public sessions
- Ask for advice, not money, initially

**Leverage existing connections:**
- Ask current investors for introductions
- Request referrals from advisors and mentors
- Tap into alumni networks from your university or previous employers
- Connect through mutual founders who have raised capital

Several platforms can help you identify and connect with potential investors.

## Approaching Angel Investors

Angel investors are individuals who invest their own money in early-stage startups. They often provide more than capital—they bring experience, mentorship, and connections.

**Where to find angels:**

## Pitch Events and Competitions

Pitch competitions provide visibility, feedback, and sometimes direct funding.

## Leveraging Accelerators and Incubators

Accelerators provide structured programs that culminate in investor introductions through demo days.

**Top accelerators to consider:**

**What accelerators provide:**

**Best practices:**

- Only accept from those who can afford to lose the investment
- Maintain transparent communication throughout

**Cautions:**
- Don't pressure anyone to invest

## Creating Your Investor Pipeline

Treat fundraising like sales—build a pipeline and track progress systematically.

| Stage | Description | Actions |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Research | Identifying potential investors | Build target list, research backgrounds |
| Outreach | Initial contact | Seek introductions, send initial emails |
| First Meeting | Initial pitch | Deliver pitch, answer questions |
| Follow-up | Due diligence | Provide data room access, references |
| Negotiation | Term sheet stage | Review terms, negotiate |
| Close | Legal completion | Sign documents, wire funds |

**Pipeline management tips:**
- Track all investor interactions in a CRM or spreadsheet
- Note investor feedback and concerns
- Follow up consistently but respectfully
- Aim for parallel processes to create urgency
- Target 50-100+ investors for a typical seed round

## Preparing Your Materials

Have these ready before beginning outreach:

**Essential materials:**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Fundraising pitfalls:**

- Relying solely on cold emails
- Targeting investors who don't invest in your stage or sector
- Not researching investors before meetings
- Raising too little or too much capital
- Giving away too much equity too early
- Neglecting your business while fundraising
- Taking money from the wrong investors

## Key Metrics Investors Want to See

Prepare to discuss these depending on your stage:

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) | Revenue traction and predictability |
| Growth Rate | Month-over-month or year-over-year acceleration |
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | Efficiency of growth spending |

## Summary

Finding startup investors requires a strategic, systematic approach. Build your network before you need it, research investors thoroughly, leverage multiple channels, and treat fundraising as a full-time effort during active raises. Focus on investors who align with your stage, sector, and vision. Remember that fundraising is ultimately about finding partners who believe in your mission and can help you build a successful company—not just sources of capital.
