  <p>Type I assesses control design at a point in time, while Type II assesses both design and operating effectiveness over a period of time</p>
  <p>A SOC 2 Type I report evaluates whether an organization's controls are suitably designed at a specific point in time. A Type II report goes further by assessing both the design and the operating effectiveness of those controls over a period of time, typically 6-12 months. This distinction is important for technology professionals because Type II reports provide stronger assurance that controls are not only well-designed but are actually working as intended over an extended period.</p>
