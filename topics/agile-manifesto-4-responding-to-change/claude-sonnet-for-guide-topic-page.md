# Agile manifesto 4: Responding to change

This point shifts in how software development teams approach project management and execution. This value acknowledges that in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, rigid adherence to predetermined plans often leads to obsolete solutions that no longer meet user needs or market demands.

Traditional software development methodologies emphasized comprehensive upfront planning, detailed documentation, and strict adherence to predetermined schedules. However, this approach frequently resulted in products that were outdated by the time they reached users, as requirements inevitably changed throughout the development lifecycle. The Agile philosophy recognizes that change is not only inevitable but should be embraced as an opportunity to deliver greater value.

Responding to change doesn't mean abandoning planning altogether. Instead, it promotes adaptive planning that remains flexible and responsive to new information, user feedback, and shifting market conditions. Agile teams create lightweight plans that serve as guides rather than rigid contracts, allowing for continuous adjustment based on learning and discovery.

This point encourages teams to view change requests not as disruptions but as valuable insights that can improve the final product. By maintaining short iteration cycles and regular feedback loops, teams can quickly incorporate changes without derailing the project. The emphasis shifts from following a predetermined path to navigating toward the best possible outcome.
