  <p>View changes as valuable insights that can improve the final product</p>
  <p>The Agile Manifesto values "responding to change over following a plan." This means teams should embrace change requests not as disruptions but as opportunities to deliver greater value. By maintaining short iteration cycles and regular feedback loops, Agile teams can quickly incorporate changes while navigating toward the best possible outcome, rather than rigidly adhering to predetermined plans that may lead to obsolete solutions.</p>
