  <p>By multiplying Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by 12</p>
  <p>ARR is calculated by taking the monthly recurring revenue and multiplying it by 12 to annualize the figure. For example, if a company has $100,000 in MRR, their ARR would be $1.2 million. This calculation provides a standardized way for SaaS and subscription-based companies to measure and communicate their predictable revenue stream to stakeholders and investors.</p>
