  <p>Cross-functional teams collaborate to balance pedagogical effectiveness with technical requirements</p>
  <p>Agile methodology in education brings together developers, instructional designers, and educators who work collaboratively to ensure software solutions address both pedagogical goals and technical needs. This cross-functional approach enables rapid prototyping, continuous feedback from teachers and learners, and quick adjustments—making it especially valuable for creating adaptive learning systems and responding to evolving educational demands like remote learning.</p>
