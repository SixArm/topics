# Davies-Bouldin Index

Question: When evaluating clustering quality using the Davies-Bouldin Index, what does a lower value indicate?

- [ ] The clusters have high overlap and poor separation
- [ ] Better clustering with well-separated and distinct clusters
- [ ] The number of clusters should be increased
- [ ] Higher similarity between all clusters in the dataset

  <p>Better clustering with well-separated and distinct clusters</p>
  <p>The Davies-Bouldin Index measures the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster. A lower value indicates better clustering because it means clusters are well-separated and more distinct from each other. Conversely, a higher value indicates poorer clustering with poorly-separated clusters. This makes the Davies-Bouldin Index an inverse metric where lower is better, unlike some other clustering metrics.</p>
