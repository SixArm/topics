  <p>Accountable</p>
  <p>The Accountable role is the person who is ultimately accountable for the outcome or success of the project or process. This differs from the Responsible role, which refers to the person or team completing the task. The Consulted role provides expertise before decisions are made, and the Informed role simply needs to be notified about progress without having an active role.</p>
