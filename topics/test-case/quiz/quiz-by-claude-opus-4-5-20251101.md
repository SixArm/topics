# Test case

Question: What is a key characteristic that makes test cases effective in software testing automation?

- [ ] Test cases should be dependent on each other to ensure comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Test cases should test multiple functionalities simultaneously for efficiency
- [ ] Test cases should be atomic, testing one specific functionality or requirement at a time
- [ ] Test cases should be executed only once before deployment

  <p>Test cases should be atomic, testing one specific functionality or requirement at a time</p>
  <p>Effective test cases are designed to be atomic because this approach makes it easier to identify the root cause of failures and maintain the test suite over time. When a test case focuses on a single functionality, pinpointing what went wrong becomes straightforward. Additionally, atomic test cases should be independent, allowing them to run in any order without affecting other test cases' outcomes.</p>
