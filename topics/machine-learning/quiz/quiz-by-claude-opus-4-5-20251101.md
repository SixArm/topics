# Machine learning

Question: What is the fundamental purpose of machine learning algorithms?

- [ ] To replace all human decision-making in organizations
- [ ] To store and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently
- [ ] To learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming
- [ ] To manually program specific rules for every possible scenario

  <p>To learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming</p>
  <p>Machine learning is fundamentally about training algorithms on labeled datasets so they can identify patterns and then apply those patterns to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data—without requiring explicit programming for each scenario. This distinguishes ML from traditional rule-based programming approaches.</p>
