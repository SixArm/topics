  <p>Their ownership stake may be diluted</p>
  <p>Pay-to-play provisions require existing investors to participate in future funding rounds to maintain their ownership percentage. If an investor chooses not to participate, they face dilution of their ownership stake. For example, an investor who owns 20% before a funding round might see their stake reduced to 15% if they don't participate in the subsequent round.</p>
