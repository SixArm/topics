  <p>Agile emphasizes iterative development with continuous feedback and adaptation throughout the project</p>
  <p>Agile is fundamentally different from Waterfall in that it embraces change and iteration rather than following a strict sequential process. While Waterfall requires completing each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) before moving to the next, Agile delivers work in short cycles (sprints/iterations) with continuous feedback. Agile is also a broad methodology that teams often combine with other approaches such as Extreme Programming (XP), Lean, Scrum, Kanban, and Spiral methodologies.</p>
