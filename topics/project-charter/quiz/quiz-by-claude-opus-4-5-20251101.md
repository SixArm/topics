  <p>During the initiation phase, by the project sponsor and key stakeholders</p>
  <p>A project charter is created during the early stages of the project, specifically during the initiation phase. It is then approved by the project sponsor and other key stakeholders before project planning and execution begin. This timing is critical because the charter serves as a foundational document that provides the framework for all subsequent project planning, execution, and monitoring activities.</p>
