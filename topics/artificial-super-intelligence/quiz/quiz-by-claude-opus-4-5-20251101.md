# Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

Question: What is the defining characteristic of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that distinguishes it from other forms of AI?

- [ ] The ability to process natural language and generate human-like text responses
- [ ] The capacity for recursive self-improvement, enabling it to enhance its own intelligence and capabilities
- [ ] The use of neural networks with more than one billion parameters
- [ ] The ability to beat humans at specific games like chess or Go

  <p>The capacity for recursive self-improvement, enabling it to enhance its own intelligence and capabilities</p>
  <p>Recursive self-improvement is one of the defining features of ASI. Unlike narrow AI systems that excel at specific tasks, ASI would be able to enhance its own algorithms, architecture, and problem-solving methods autonomously. This capability is central to the concept of ASI and is closely tied to concerns about the technological singularity—a hypothetical point where AI-driven progress could create profound, potentially unpredictable changes in human society.</p>
