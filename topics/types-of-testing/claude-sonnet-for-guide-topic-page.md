# Types of testing

Software testing automation encompasses various types of testing approaches that can be categorized based on their scope and testing objectives. Unit testing forms the foundation of automated testing, focusing on individual components or modules in isolation to verify their functionality works as expected. This type of testing is typically performed by developers during the coding phase and helps catch bugs early in the development cycle.

Integration testing validates the interaction between different modules or services within an application. It ensures that combined components work correctly together and can identify interface defects that unit tests might miss. This testing level is crucial for detecting issues that arise when individual units are combined.

System testing examines the complete integrated application to verify it meets specified requirements. This comprehensive approach tests the entire system's functionality, performance, and behavior in an environment that closely mimics production conditions. It validates end-to-end workflows and user scenarios.

Regression testing ensures that new code changes don't break existing functionality. This type of testing is particularly valuable in automated environments since it can be run repeatedly whenever code modifications are made, providing confidence that previously working features remain intact.

Performance testing evaluates system responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various load conditions. Automated performance tests can simulate multiple users, measure response times, and identify bottlenecks that could impact user experience.

API testing focuses on verifying application programming interfaces, ensuring data exchange between different software components occurs correctly. This testing type validates data formats, error handling, and functionality without relying on user interfaces, making it ideal for automation in modern service-oriented architectures.
