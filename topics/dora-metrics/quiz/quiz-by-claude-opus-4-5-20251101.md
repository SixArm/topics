# DORA metrics

Question: What are the four key performance indicators that comprise DORA metrics for evaluating software development and delivery processes?

- [ ] Code coverage, bug count, sprint velocity, and team satisfaction
- [ ] Lead time for changes, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR), and change failure rate
- [ ] Lines of code, number of commits, pull request count, and test pass rate
- [ ] Server uptime, response latency, memory usage, and CPU utilization

  <p>Lead time for changes, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR), and change failure rate</p>
  <p>DORA metrics consist of these four specific KPIs: Lead time for changes measures time from code commit to deployment; Deployment frequency measures how often code is deployed to production; Mean time to restore (MTTR) measures average recovery time after failures; and Change failure rate measures the percentage of changes causing failures or outages. These metrics help organizations assess and improve their DevOps practices.</p>
