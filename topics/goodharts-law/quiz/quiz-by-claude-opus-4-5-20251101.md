  <p>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure</p>
  <p>Goodhart's Law, originally formulated by British economist Charles Goodhart, warns that once a metric is used as a target for decision-making or incentives, people will optimize for that specific metric rather than the underlying goal it was meant to represent. This often leads to gaming, manipulation, or unintended consequences. For technology professionals, this is critical when designing KPIs, performance metrics, or algorithmic systems—optimizing for proxy metrics (like lines of code, story points, or click-through rates) can lead to behavior that undermines the actual objectives you're trying to achieve.</p>
