- [ ] Lean uses time-boxed sprints with regular retrospectives, while Agile focuses on continuous flow
- [ ] Agile emphasizes iterative development and customer collaboration, while Lean focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing value delivery
- [ ] Agile measures cycle time and throughput, while Lean tracks velocity and burndown charts

  <p>Agile emphasizes iterative development and customer collaboration, while Lean focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing value delivery</p>
  <p>Agile emerged from the software development industry in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto, prioritizing working software, customer feedback through short iterations, and adaptive planning. Lean, originally developed by Toyota for manufacturing, concentrates on identifying and removing bottlenecks, reducing cycle times, and minimizing work-in-progress to improve flow efficiency. While both methodologies complement each other, their primary focus areas differ fundamentally.</p>
