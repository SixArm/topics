# Agile vs Lean

Agile and Lean are complementary methodologies in software engineering that share common values but differ in their primary focus and origins. Agile emerged from the software development industry in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto, emphasizing iterative development, customer collaboration, and responding to change. It prioritizes working software, individuals and interactions, and adaptive planning through frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming.

Lean, originally developed by Toyota for manufacturing, focuses on eliminating waste and maximizing value delivery. In software engineering, Lean principles emphasize reducing unnecessary work, optimizing the whole system, and delivering value as quickly as possible. It concentrates on identifying and removing bottlenecks, reducing cycle times, and minimizing work-in-progress to improve flow efficiency.

While Agile emphasizes flexibility and customer feedback through short iterations, Lean prioritizes continuous improvement and waste elimination throughout the entire value stream. Agile teams typically work in time-boxed sprints with regular retrospectives, whereas Lean focuses on continuous flow and just-in-time delivery. Agile metrics often include velocity and burndown charts, while Lean emphasizes cycle time, throughput, and lead time measurements.

The two approaches complement each other effectively. Agile provides the framework for iterative development and team collaboration, while Lean offers tools for optimizing processes and eliminating inefficiencies. Many organizations successfully combine both methodologies, using Agile practices for team-level execution while applying Lean principles for organizational-level optimization. This hybrid approach leverages Agile's emphasis on people and collaboration with Lean's focus on systematic improvement and waste reduction, creating a more comprehensive approach to software development that delivers value efficiently while maintaining quality and team satisfaction.
