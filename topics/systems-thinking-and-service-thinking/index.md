# Systems thinking and service thinking

Systems thinking and service thinking are complementary approaches to
understanding and improving organizational performance. Both ways view work as
interconnected systems rather than isolated processes or departments.

**Systems thinking** focuses on understanding the relationships, patterns, and
structures that influence behavior within organizations. It recognizes that
problems often stem from the system's design rather than individual failures,
encouraging leaders to examine root causes and unintended consequences of their
decisions.

**Service thinking** involves studying demand patterns, identifying value work
versus waste, and recognizing that variation in customer needs requires flexible
responses rather than standardized procedures. The approach emphasizes
capability over activity, focusing on the system's ability to deliver what
customers value.

**The Vanguard Method** applies systems thinking specifically to service
organizations, distinguishing between "command and control" management and
"beyond command and control" management. The method argues that traditional
management methods, with their emphasis on targets, standardization, and
inspection, actually create waste and reduce performance in service
environments. Instead, the method advocates for understanding work from the
customer's perspective, measuring what matters to customers, and designing
systems that can absorb variety rather than eliminate it.
