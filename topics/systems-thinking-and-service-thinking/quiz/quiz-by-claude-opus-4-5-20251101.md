  <p>Problems often stem from system design rather than individual failures</p>
  <p>Both systems thinking and service thinking view work as interconnected systems rather than isolated processes. Systems thinking specifically recognizes that problems often stem from the system's design rather than individual failures, encouraging leaders to examine root causes and unintended consequences. This contrasts with traditional "command and control" management that relies on targets, standardization, and inspection—approaches that the Vanguard Method argues actually create waste and reduce performance in service environments.</p>
