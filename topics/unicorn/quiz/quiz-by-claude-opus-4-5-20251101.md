  <p>$1 billion or more</p>
  <p>The term "unicorn" was coined by venture capitalist Aileen Lee in 2013 to describe privately held startup companies valued at $1 billion or more. The name reflects the rarity of such companies—like mythical unicorns, they were considered extremely uncommon. Famous examples include Uber, Airbnb, and SpaceX.</p>
