# Database migration testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of post-migration validation in database migration testing?

- [ ] To document the original database structure before migration begins
- [ ] To monitor the transfer process for errors and timeouts in real-time
- [ ] To compare source and target databases by verifying record counts, data values, schema integrity, and referential relationships
- [ ] To measure query response times and database load capacity

  <p>To compare source and target databases by verifying record counts, data values, schema integrity, and referential relationships</p>
  <p>Post-migration validation forms the core of automated database migration testing. It uses automated data comparison tools to verify that data has been accurately transferred by checking record counts, data values, schema integrity, and referential relationships between the source and target databases. This ensures data integrity and that the migration was successful before applications begin using the new database.</p>
