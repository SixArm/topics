  <p>To indicate the participation of different actors or departments in a process</p>
  <p>Swimlanes are visual elements in activity diagrams represented as horizontal or vertical rectangles that organize activities by the actor, role, or department responsible for performing them. This helps clarify ownership and handoffs between different participants in a workflow, making it easier to understand who is responsible for each step in the process.</p>
