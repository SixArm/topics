  <p>A couple of weeks to a couple of months, with preference for shorter cycles</p>
  <p>Agile Principle 3 states "Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale." Shorter delivery cycles provide more opportunities for feedback, course correction, and validation of assumptions, allowing teams to quickly identify issues and make necessary adjustments before investing significant additional resources.</p>
