# Agile principle 3: Deliver frequently

"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."

This agile principle emphasizes rapid, iterative delivery of functional software rather than waiting months or years for a complete product release. The core philosophy is that frequent deliveries provide continuous value to customers while enabling teams to gather feedback and adapt quickly to changing requirements.

The preference for shorter timescales reflects the reality that customer needs, market conditions, and technical understanding evolve rapidly. Companies that embrace frequent delivery can pivot quickly when initial assumptions prove incorrect, minimize the risk of building unwanted features, and maintain closer alignment with customer expectations. This approach transforms software development from a lengthy, uncertain process into a series of manageable, validated steps toward customer satisfaction.

Spotify exemplifies this principle through their continuous deployment practices, releasing new features to their mobile app multiple times per week. Their engineering teams work in short sprints, typically two weeks, allowing them to respond rapidly to user feedback and market changes. This approach has enabled them to maintain their competitive edge in the music streaming industry by constantly evolving their user experience.

Netflix operates similarly, deploying code changes hundreds of times daily across their platform. Their microservices architecture supports this frequent delivery model, allowing different teams to release updates to specific features without affecting the entire system. This enables them to A/B test new features, personalization algorithms, and user interface improvements continuously.

Facebook's famous "move fast and break things" culture historically embodied this principle, with developers pushing code changes multiple times daily. Even as they've matured into Meta, they maintain rapid release cycles for their social media platforms, enabling quick responses to user behavior trends and competitive pressures.
