# Agile principle 3: Deliver frequently

"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."

This approach shifts away from traditional waterfall methodologies that might take months or years to produce a single deliverable, instead advocating for continuous delivery of working products.

The principle specifically recommends delivery timeframes ranging from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a clear preference for shorter cycles. This preference reflects the understanding that shorter delivery cycles provide more opportunities for feedback, course correction, and validation of assumptions. When teams deliver working software every two to four weeks, they can quickly identify issues, gather user feedback, and make necessary adjustments before investing significant additional resources.

Frequent delivery offers numerous benefits beyond just faster feedback loops. It helps maintain team momentum, provides regular opportunities to demonstrate progress to stakeholders, and reduces the risk associated with large, infrequent releases. When problems arise, they are typically smaller in scope and easier to address when caught early through regular delivery cycles.

This approach also enables better risk management by breaking down complex projects into manageable increments. Each delivery represents a milestone that can be evaluated independently, allowing teams to pivot or adjust their approach based on real-world usage and feedback rather than theoretical requirements.

The emphasis on working software is equally important â€“ these deliveries must be functional and valuable to end users, not just technical demonstrations or partial implementations. This ensures work provides genuine value while building toward larger goals, and ensures focus on practical outcomes rather than just development activity.
