# Supervised learning algorithms

Question: What distinguishes supervised learning algorithms from other machine learning approaches?

- [ ] They require no input data to generate predictions
- [ ] They learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data
- [ ] They only work with image recognition tasks
- [ ] They automatically generate their own training labels without human input

  <p>They learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data</p>
  <p>Supervised learning algorithms are defined by their use of labeled training data, where each example includes both input features and a known target output. The algorithm learns the relationship between inputs and outputs, then applies this learned pattern to predict outcomes for new, unseen data. This distinguishes them from unsupervised learning (which works with unlabeled data) and reinforcement learning (which learns through trial and error with rewards).</p>
