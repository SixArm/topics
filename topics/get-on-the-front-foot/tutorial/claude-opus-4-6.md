# Get on the front foot

"Get on the front foot" is a phrase that means taking a proactive, forward-leaning approach to a situation rather than waiting for events to unfold and reacting to them. Originating from sports such as cricket and football, where being on the front foot signals an attacking posture, the concept has become a staple of business and technology leadership vocabulary. For technology professionals, getting on the front foot means anticipating challenges, seizing opportunities early, and shaping outcomes rather than being shaped by them. It is the opposite of firefighting: instead of scrambling to respond to crises, you prepare, position, and act with deliberate intent.

## Origin and meaning

The phrase comes from team sports, particularly cricket, football (soccer), and rugby. In cricket, a batsman steps onto the front foot to play an aggressive, attacking shot, moving toward the ball rather than retreating. In football, a team on the front foot is pressing forward, controlling possession, and dictating the tempo of the match.

When transplanted into professional settings, the metaphor retains its core meaning: move forward, take initiative, and control the situation. A technology professional on the front foot is not passively waiting for requirements, bug reports, or directives. They are scanning the horizon, identifying what needs to happen next, and making it happen before anyone has to ask.

## Why it matters for technology professionals

Technology environments are characterized by rapid change, ambiguity, and high stakes. Waiting for problems to surface before acting leads to technical debt, missed deadlines, security incidents, and lost competitive advantage. Getting on the front foot is a force multiplier because it shifts the dynamic from reactive to proactive.

| Reactive posture | Proactive (front foot) posture |
|---|---|
| Fixing bugs after users report them | Implementing monitoring and alerting to catch issues before users notice |
| Responding to security breaches after they occur | Conducting regular threat modeling and penetration testing |
| Scrambling to scale infrastructure during traffic spikes | Capacity planning and load testing ahead of anticipated demand |
| Learning a new technology only when forced to adopt it | Continuously evaluating emerging tools and building skills in advance |
| Waiting for stakeholders to define requirements | Engaging stakeholders early with prototypes and proposals |

## Proactive versus reactive approaches

Understanding the distinction between proactive and reactive behavior is essential to applying this concept effectively.

- **Proactive behavior** involves anticipating future conditions and acting in advance. It requires awareness of trends, risks, and opportunities, combined with the discipline to invest time and effort before the payoff is visible.
- **Reactive behavior** involves responding to events after they happen. While sometimes necessary, a predominantly reactive stance leads to constant firefighting, poor prioritization, and burnout.

The goal is not to eliminate all reactive work, which is unavoidable in any operational environment. The goal is to shift the balance so that proactive work forms the foundation and reactive work is the exception rather than the norm.

## Practical applications

Getting on the front foot manifests differently depending on your role and context. Below are concrete ways technology professionals can adopt this mindset.

- **Architecture and design**: Identify scalability and maintainability concerns during the design phase rather than discovering them in production. Propose design reviews and architecture decision records before problems emerge.
- **Communication**: Share progress updates, blockers, and risks with stakeholders before they have to ask. Over-communication in the early stages of a project prevents misunderstandings and builds trust.
- **Career development**: Acquire skills and certifications in areas that are gaining traction in your industry, rather than waiting until your current skills become obsolete.
- **Incident management**: Establish runbooks, on-call procedures, and post-incident review processes before a major outage forces you to improvise.
- **Stakeholder management**: Bring data, proposals, and options to meetings rather than waiting for others to set the agenda. Frame conversations around solutions, not just problems.
- **Technical debt**: Allocate time in each sprint or development cycle to address known debt, rather than letting it accumulate until it causes outages or slows delivery to a crawl.

## Common barriers and how to overcome them

Adopting a front-foot approach is not always straightforward. Several common barriers can prevent individuals and teams from being proactive.

| Barrier | Description | How to overcome it |
|---|---|---|
| Time pressure | Day-to-day operational demands leave little room for forward-looking work | Block dedicated time on your calendar for strategic and preventive tasks; treat it as non-negotiable |
| Lack of visibility | You cannot anticipate what you cannot see; limited access to business context reduces foresight | Build relationships across teams; attend cross-functional meetings; read company strategy documents |
| Fear of overstepping | Professionals may hesitate to act without explicit instruction, especially in hierarchical organizations | Start small with low-risk initiatives; demonstrate value to build credibility and earn latitude |
| Perfectionism | Waiting for a perfect plan before acting delays action indefinitely | Adopt an iterative mindset; a good-enough action taken early outperforms a perfect action taken too late |
| Organizational culture | Some environments reward firefighting heroes more than quiet prevention | Advocate for metrics that value prevention; document and publicize proactive wins |

## Indicators you are on the front foot

It can be useful to assess whether you are genuinely operating proactively or merely staying busy. Consider the following indicators.

- You raise risks and issues at the start of projects, not during post-mortems.
- Your stakeholders rarely need to chase you for updates.
- You have a documented plan for what you will do when common failure scenarios occur.
- You are learning technologies and methodologies before your projects require them.
- You propose improvements and initiatives rather than waiting for assignments.
- Your team spends more time on planned work than on unplanned, urgent tasks.

Professionals interested in deepening their understanding of proactive strategy should explore related concepts including anticipatory design, which applies forward-thinking to user experience; the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act), which provides a structured framework for rapid proactive decision-making; the Eisenhower decision matrix, which helps prioritize proactive work over merely urgent tasks; risk management practices that systematize the identification of threats before they materialize; and the concept of strategic alignment, which ensures proactive efforts are directed toward organizational goals rather than scattered across disconnected initiatives.

## Summary

Getting on the front foot is a mindset and a discipline. It means moving toward challenges rather than away from them, anticipating rather than reacting, and leading rather than following. For technology professionals, this translates into better architecture decisions, stronger stakeholder relationships, more resilient systems, and more fulfilling careers. The shift from reactive to proactive does not happen overnight, but every deliberate step forward, every risk identified early, and every conversation initiated before it becomes urgent compounds into a fundamentally different way of working. The professionals and teams that consistently get on the front foot are the ones that shape their environments rather than being shaped by them.
