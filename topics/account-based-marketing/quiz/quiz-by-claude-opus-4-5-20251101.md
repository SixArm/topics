  <p>It targets and engages specific high-value accounts with personalized marketing efforts</p>
  <p>Account-based marketing (ABM) is defined by its strategic focus on targeting specific high-value accounts or organizations rather than casting a wide net to a broader market. ABM tailors marketing efforts to meet the specific needs of individual accounts through personalized campaigns, customized content, and multi-channel engagement, aiming to build strong relationships and maximize ROI with the most promising prospects.</p>
