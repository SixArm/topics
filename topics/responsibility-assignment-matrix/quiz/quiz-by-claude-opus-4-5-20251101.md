  <p>Accountable</p>
  <p>In a RACI matrix, the Accountable role represents the single individual who has ultimate ownership and authority over a task. While the Responsible person does the work, the Accountable person is the one who must answer for the task's completion and quality. There should be only one Accountable person per task to avoid confusion about ownership.</p>
