  <p>A program is a group of related projects managed collectively to achieve broader organizational objectives</p>
  <p>A project is a temporary endeavor with a defined set of objectives, deliverables, and a specific timeline aimed at creating a unique product, service, or result. In contrast, a program is a strategically-aligned initiative that coordinates multiple related projects to realize benefits and synergies that may not be achievable through individual projects alone. Programs have long-term objectives extending beyond the duration of individual projects.</p>
