  <p>The "nine dots puzzle" from the 1960s, where solving it required drawing lines beyond the perceived square boundary</p>
  <p>The phrase originated from a popular puzzle where nine dots were arranged in a square, and the challenge was to connect all nine dots with four straight lines without lifting the pen. The solution required drawing lines outside of the perceived boundary of the square, which led to the term "thinking outside of the box" to describe unconventional thinking.</p>
