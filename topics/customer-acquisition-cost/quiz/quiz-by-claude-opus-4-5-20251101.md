  <p>Compare CAC to Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) to determine if acquisition generates profit</p>
  <p>Comparing CAC to LTV is the key method for assessing acquisition profitability. If LTV exceeds CAC, the company profits from acquiring customers; if CAC exceeds LTV, the company loses money on each acquisition. This ratio helps businesses make informed decisions about marketing spend and understand the true return on investment of their customer acquisition efforts.</p>
