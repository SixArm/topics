# Simple agreement for future equity (SAFE)

A Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) is a financing instrument that allows an investor to provide capital to a startup in exchange for the right to convert that investment into equity at a later date, typically during the next priced equity financing round. Developed by the startup accelerator Y Combinator in 2013, SAFEs have become one of the most widely used instruments for early-stage fundraising in the technology industry. They offer a streamlined alternative to convertible notes by eliminating interest rates, maturity dates, and the associated legal complexity, making them faster and cheaper to execute for both founders and investors.

## How a SAFE Works

When a startup accepts investment through a SAFE, no equity changes hands immediately. Instead, the investor receives a contractual right to obtain shares in the future when a triggering event occurs. The most common triggering event is a priced equity financing round, such as a Series A, where the company issues preferred stock at a defined price per share. At that point, the SAFE converts into shares of the same class being issued in the new round, subject to any discount or valuation cap specified in the SAFE.

If no triggering event occurs, the SAFE remains outstanding indefinitely. Unlike a convertible note, a SAFE has no maturity date, so there is no deadline by which the company must repay or convert. The investor bears the risk that the company may never raise a priced round or may fail entirely, in which case the SAFE investment is lost. However, SAFEs typically include provisions for liquidity events such as acquisitions or IPOs, ensuring the investor receives either a return of capital or converted equity in those scenarios.

## Key Terms and Mechanics

SAFEs are governed by a small number of negotiable terms. Understanding these terms is essential for any technology professional involved in fundraising or cap table management.

| Term | Definition | Impact on Investor | Impact on Founder |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Valuation Cap | Maximum company valuation at which the SAFE converts to equity | Provides upside protection; lower cap means more shares | Higher cap preserves more founder ownership |
| Discount Rate | Percentage reduction applied to the price per share in the next round | Rewards early investment risk with a lower effective price | Increases dilution relative to new investors |
| Pro Rata Rights | Option to invest additional capital in future rounds to maintain ownership percentage | Protects against dilution in subsequent financings | May limit flexibility in future round allocation |
| Most Favored Nation (MFN) | Clause allowing SAFE holder to adopt better terms if later SAFEs are issued | Ensures early investors are not disadvantaged | Constrains ability to offer better terms to later investors |

A SAFE may include a valuation cap only, a discount only, both, or neither. The most common configuration in practice is a SAFE with a valuation cap and no discount. When both are present, the investor typically receives whichever mechanism yields a lower price per share at conversion.

## Pre-Money vs. Post-Money SAFEs

Y Combinator introduced the post-money SAFE in 2018 to address ambiguity in dilution calculations that arose with the original pre-money version. The distinction between the two is significant for cap table planning.

- **Pre-money SAFE**: The valuation cap applies before the new investment in the priced round is added. This means the exact ownership percentage the SAFE holder will receive depends on the size of the new round and the number of other SAFEs outstanding, making dilution harder to predict in advance.
- **Post-money SAFE**: The valuation cap includes the SAFE investment itself but excludes the new money raised in the priced round. This provides clarity because the investor can calculate their exact ownership percentage at conversion simply by dividing their investment amount by the valuation cap.

For example, if an investor puts $500,000 into a post-money SAFE with a $5 million cap, they know they will own exactly 10% of the company on a post-money SAFE basis at conversion, regardless of the round size. This transparency has made the post-money SAFE the standard form used today.

## Advantages of SAFEs

- **Speed and simplicity**: SAFEs are typically five pages or fewer and use standardized templates, reducing legal costs to a few hundred dollars compared to thousands for a priced round.
- **No debt characteristics**: Unlike convertible notes, SAFEs carry no interest rate and no maturity date, removing the pressure of repayment deadlines and the accrual of additional obligations.
- **Founder-friendly flexibility**: Founders can raise capital incrementally from multiple investors over time without needing to coordinate a single closing or negotiate a full term sheet.
- **Standardization**: The widespread adoption of Y Combinator's template means investors and founders share a common understanding of the instrument's mechanics, reducing negotiation friction.
- **Minimal governance burden**: SAFEs do not create board seats, voting rights, or information rights at the time of investment, preserving founder control during the earliest stages.

## Risks and Disadvantages

- **Dilution uncertainty**: When multiple SAFEs are outstanding with different caps and discounts, the cumulative dilution at conversion can surprise founders who have not modeled the scenarios carefully.
- **No investor protections**: SAFE holders have no voting rights, no board representation, and limited information rights until conversion. This makes SAFEs less attractive to investors who want governance involvement.
- **Stacking risk**: Issuing many SAFEs over an extended period can create a large overhang of future dilution that makes the company less attractive to Series A investors who want to understand the fully diluted cap table.
- **No maturity incentive**: Because SAFEs have no expiration, there is no structural pressure on the company to reach a priced round. This can be a disadvantage for investors in companies that remain in a perpetual seed stage.
- **Tax and accounting ambiguity**: SAFEs are not classified as debt or equity under all tax jurisdictions, which can create complexity for both companies and investors in financial reporting.

## SAFEs Compared to Convertible Notes

Technology professionals frequently encounter both SAFEs and convertible notes in early-stage fundraising. The following comparison highlights the key differences.

| Feature | SAFE | Convertible Note |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Interest rate | None | Typically 2-8% annually |
| Maturity date | None | Usually 12-24 months |
| Repayment obligation | No | Yes, if not converted by maturity |
| Legal complexity | Low; standardized template | Moderate; more negotiation points |
| Legal cost | $0-500 typical | $2,000-5,000 typical |
| Investor seniority | Not debt; no creditor status | Debt instrument; creditor rights in insolvency |
| Conversion trigger | Priced equity round, acquisition, or IPO | Priced equity round, maturity, or acquisition |
| Governance rights | None until conversion | May include information rights or consent provisions |

Convertible notes remain more common in certain markets and among investors who prefer the structural protections of a debt instrument. SAFEs dominate in Silicon Valley and among accelerator-backed companies.

## Best Practices for Technology Professionals

- **Model your cap table**: Before issuing SAFEs, build a cap table model that simulates conversion at various Series A valuations. Understand the fully diluted ownership under best-case, expected, and worst-case scenarios.
- **Limit the number of SAFEs**: Avoid issuing an excessive number of SAFEs with varying terms. Each additional SAFE increases cap table complexity and can create friction during a priced round.
- **Use post-money SAFEs**: The post-money SAFE provides clearer ownership math for both founders and investors. It is the current industry standard.
- **Communicate with investors**: Even though SAFEs do not require formal reporting, maintaining transparency with SAFE holders builds trust and makes future fundraising smoother.
- **Consult legal counsel**: While SAFEs are simple, the interaction between multiple SAFEs, option pools, and priced round terms can create unexpected outcomes. A startup attorney experienced in venture financing should review the terms.

## Summary

A Simple Agreement for Future Equity is a streamlined investment instrument that enables startups to raise early-stage capital without establishing a formal valuation or taking on debt. By deferring the pricing decision to a future equity round, SAFEs reduce legal costs, accelerate fundraising timelines, and provide flexibility for both founders and investors. The post-money SAFE, now the industry standard, offers clear ownership calculations that simplify cap table planning. However, SAFEs carry risks including dilution uncertainty, stacking effects from multiple instruments, and limited investor protections. Technology professionals involved in startup financing should model conversion scenarios carefully, maintain cap table discipline, and understand how SAFEs interact with subsequent funding rounds to make informed decisions.
