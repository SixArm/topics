  <p>It allows raising capital without establishing a company valuation at the time of investment</p>
  <p>The key feature of a SAFE is that it enables startups to raise capital without having to establish a valuation at the time of the investment. This is advantageous because it allows the investor to participate in potential upside without making a specific valuation judgment, and it allows the startup to avoid the complications and expenses associated with a traditional equity financing round where valuation must be determined upfront.</p>
