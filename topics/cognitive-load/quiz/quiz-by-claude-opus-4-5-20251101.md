  <p>Extraneous Cognitive Load</p>
  <p>Extraneous cognitive load is the unnecessary mental effort imposed by poor design choices rather than the task itself. Unlike intrinsic cognitive load (which is inherent to the task's complexity) or germane cognitive load (which is beneficial for learning), extraneous cognitive load provides no value and actively harms user experience. Reducing extraneous cognitive load through clearer interfaces, intuitive navigation, and well-organized information is a primary goal in UX design.</p>
