  <p>To outline collaboration terms for developing a product that parties cannot complete independently</p>
  <p>A JDA is a legal contract where two or more parties collaborate on a project by pooling resources and expertise to create a product that neither could develop alone. The agreement defines the division of responsibilities, financial arrangements, intellectual property rights, and project scope to ensure all parties have a clear understanding of their roles and the partnership terms.</p>
