  <p>Definition of Ready (DoR)</p>
  <p>The Definition of Ready (DoR) specifies the criteria a user story or backlog item must satisfy before it can be pulled into a sprint for development. This ensures the team has enough clarity, requirements, and information to begin work without blockers, improving sprint predictability and reducing mid-sprint rework.</p>
