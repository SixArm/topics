# Agile Definitions: Tutorial

## Overview

Agile uses a set of shared definitions to create common understanding across teams about when work is ready to start, when it is finished, and what constitutes value. These definitions serve as alignment tools that prevent ambiguity and ensure consistent quality.

## The Core Definitions

### Definition of Story (DoS)

A story (or user story) describes a capability from the end user's perspective. It focuses on what the user wants and why, not on technical implementation. Stories follow the format: "I am a [type of user]. I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

### Definition of Ready (DoR)

The Definition of Ready establishes criteria that a work item must meet before the team begins working on it. It ensures that the team has enough information and clarity to start development without delays.

### Definition of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done specifies the criteria that must be met before work can be considered complete. It typically includes coding, testing, review, documentation, and deployment readiness standards.

### Definition of Value (DoV)

The Definition of Value articulates what constitutes meaningful benefit—from business, user, and technical perspectives. It guides prioritization by helping teams focus on work that delivers the greatest impact.

### Definition of Customer Value (DoCV)

Customer value focuses specifically on the benefits delivered to end users and stakeholders—efficiency gains, cost savings, improved experience, and reduced friction.

### Definition of Technical Value (DoTV)

Technical value encompasses the long-term health of the software system—maintainability, scalability, performance, and reduced technical debt. It enables future development efficiency.

## How These Definitions Work Together

The definitions form a pipeline:

1. **Story** defines what needs to be built and why
2. **Ready** ensures the story is sufficiently prepared for development
3. **Done** ensures the completed work meets quality standards
4. **Value** (customer and technical) ensures the work delivers meaningful benefit

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Develop definitions collaboratively**: The entire team—developers, testers, product owners, and stakeholders—should contribute to creating each definition.
2. **Keep definitions visible**: Post them on a shared board or wiki where the team references them daily.
3. **Use definitions as checklists**: During sprint planning (DoR), sprint reviews (DoD), and backlog prioritization (DoV), actively reference the relevant definition.
4. **Review and evolve**: Revisit definitions during retrospectives. As the team matures, definitions should evolve to reflect higher standards and new learning.
5. **Be specific but not rigid**: Definitions should be concrete enough to be actionable but flexible enough to accommodate different types of work.

## Key Takeaway

Shared definitions eliminate ambiguity and create alignment. When everyone on the team agrees on what "ready," "done," and "valuable" mean, communication becomes clearer, quality becomes more consistent, and disagreements about completeness or priority are resolved by reference to agreed standards rather than individual opinions.
