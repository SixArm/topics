# Agile at Amazon

Amazon's implementation of agile software engineering is exemplified through their "two-pizza team" philosophy, where teams are kept small enough to be fed by two pizzas, typically 6-8 people. This structure enables rapid decision-making and maintains the startup mentality even within a massive organization. Teams operate with high autonomy, owning their services from development through deployment and maintenance.

The company employs continuous deployment practices extensively, with some teams pushing code to production thousands of times per day. Amazon's retail website, for instance, sees deployments every 11.7 seconds on average during peak periods. This is made possible through comprehensive automated testing suites and robust monitoring systems that can quickly detect and rollback problematic changes.

Amazon's approach to agile emphasizes customer obsession over process adherence. Teams regularly conduct "working backwards" sessions, starting with mock press releases for features before writing any code. This ensures every development effort directly serves customer needs. The company also practices "fail fast" methodology, encouraging teams to experiment with new features through A/B testing and quickly iterating based on real user feedback.

Their microservices architecture supports agile principles by allowing teams to work independently on different services without blocking each other. Services like Amazon Prime, AWS Lambda, and Alexa were developed by separate teams using different technologies and deployment schedules, yet integrate seamlessly through well-defined APIs.

Amazon's agile culture extends to their leadership principles, particularly "bias for action" and "invent and simplify." Engineers are empowered to make decisions without extensive approval processes, while the company maintains its day-one mentality of treating every day like a startup's first day, fostering innovation and rapid adaptation to market changes.
