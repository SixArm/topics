  <p>Amazon's two-pizza team philosophy keeps teams small (typically 6-8 people) to enable rapid decision-making and maintain a startup mentality even within a massive organization. These teams operate with high autonomy, owning their services from development through deployment and maintenance. This structure supports Amazon's microservices architecture and allows teams to work independently without blocking each other.</p>
