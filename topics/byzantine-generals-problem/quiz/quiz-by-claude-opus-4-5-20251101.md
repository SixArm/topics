# Byzantine generals problem

Question: What is the primary challenge that the Byzantine generals problem addresses in distributed computing?

- [ ] Optimizing network bandwidth for message transmission between nodes
- [ ] Reaching consensus among nodes when some may be faulty or malicious
- [ ] Encrypting communications to prevent message interception
- [ ] Minimizing latency in synchronous distributed systems

  <p>Reaching consensus among nodes when some may be faulty or malicious</p>
  <p>The Byzantine generals problem fundamentally addresses how a distributed system can reach agreement (consensus) even when some participants may be unreliable or actively malicious—sending conflicting or arbitrary messages. This is critical for fault tolerance in distributed systems, including blockchain and cryptocurrency networks where nodes must agree on the state of the ledger despite potential bad actors.</p>
