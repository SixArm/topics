  <p>A board of advisors is an informal group providing non-binding advice, while a board of directors has legal and fiduciary responsibilities</p>
  <p>Unlike a board of directors which has legal and fiduciary responsibilities for overseeing management and ensuring the company operates according to legal and ethical standards, a board of advisors is an informal group that provides non-binding strategic guidance, expertise, and networking opportunities without the same legal obligations.</p>
