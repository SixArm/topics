  <p>To organize commands into logical categories, making it easier for users to find and select desired functions</p>
  <p>Grouping in a ribbon UI organizes commands and actions into logical groups (such as formatting options, editing tools, or document-related functions). Each group is visually distinct, often represented by icons or text labels, which improves discoverability and makes it easier for users to quickly locate and select the command they need.</p>
