# Binary heap

Question: What is the primary use case for a binary heap data structure?

- [ ] Storing elements in sorted order for binary search operations
- [ ] Implementing priority queues with efficient insertion and retrieval of min/max elements
- [ ] Maintaining a balanced tree for fast key-value lookups
- [ ] Organizing data for efficient range queries

  <p>Implementing priority queues with efficient insertion and retrieval of min/max elements</p>
  <p>A binary heap is a specialized tree structure designed for efficiently maintaining a dynamically changing collection of elements where you need quick insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the minimum element (min-heap) or maximum element (max-heap). This makes it the ideal data structure for implementing priority queues, where elements must be processed based on their priority rather than their insertion order.</p>
