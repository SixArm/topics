  <p>Setup procedures, test data preparation, execution steps, validation checkpoints, and cleanup activities</p>
  <p>A test script begins by initializing the testing environment and preparing test data, then executes specific actions while validating system responses against expected outcomes at checkpoints, and finally performs cleanup activities. These components ensure the script is complete, repeatable, and leaves the system in a known state after execution.</p>
