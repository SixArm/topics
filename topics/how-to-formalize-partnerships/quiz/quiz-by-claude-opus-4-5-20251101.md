  <p>Clearly define the purpose and objectives of the partnership to ensure alignment of goals</p>
  <p>Identifying the purpose is the foundational first step in formalizing partnerships. Without clear alignment on goals and objectives, subsequent steps like defining roles, allocating resources, and establishing governance structures lack direction. Understanding what each organization hopes to achieve ensures that all other aspects of the partnership are built on a shared vision, reducing the risk of misunderstandings and conflicts later in the collaboration.</p>
