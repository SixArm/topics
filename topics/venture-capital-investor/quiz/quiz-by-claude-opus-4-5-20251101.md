  <p>Equity (ownership percentage) in the company</p>
  <p>Venture capital investors provide financing to startups in exchange for equity, meaning they receive a percentage of ownership in the company. Unlike traditional lenders who receive interest payments, VC investors become partial owners and share in both the risks and potential rewards of the company's growth. This equity stake is how they generate returns when the company succeeds through events like acquisitions or IPOs.</p>
