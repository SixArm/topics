  <p>It provides mechanisms to operate effectively in the presence of inherent development uncertainty</p>
  <p>SAFe Principle 7 states that applying development cadence and synchronization, coupled with periodic cross-domain planning, provides the mechanisms needed to operate effectively despite inherent development uncertainty. Cadence creates predictability and rhythm, while synchronization ensures multiple perspectives are understood, resolved, and integrated simultaneously.</p>
