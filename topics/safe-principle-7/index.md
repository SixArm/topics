# Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning

"Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 7.

Cadence creates predictability and provides a rhythm for development.
Synchronization causes multiple perspectives to be understood, resolved and
integrated at the same time. Applying development cadence and synchronization,
coupled with periodic cross-domain planning, provides the mechanisms needed to
operate effectively in the presence of inherent development uncertainty.
