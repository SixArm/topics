# Apply Cadence, Synchronize with Cross-Domain Planning: Tutorial

## Overview

"Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) Principle 7. This principle addresses one of the most fundamental challenges of large-scale development: how to maintain predictability, alignment, and coordination across multiple teams working in the presence of inherent uncertainty. The answer lies in two complementary mechanisms -- cadence and synchronization -- combined with periodic cross-domain planning events.

This tutorial provides change technology professionals with a thorough understanding of these mechanisms and practical strategies for implementing them effectively in scaled agile environments.

## Key Concepts

### Cadence

Cadence is a regular, predictable rhythm of events. In SAFe, cadence operates at multiple levels:

- **Iteration cadence:** Teams work in fixed-length iterations (typically two weeks), with each iteration following a consistent pattern of planning, execution, review, and retrospection.
- **Program Increment (PI) cadence:** Multiple teams synchronize their work into Program Increments (typically 8-12 weeks), each beginning with PI Planning and ending with an Inspect & Adapt event.
- **Release cadence:** The organization establishes a regular rhythm for releasing value to customers.

Cadence provides several critical benefits:

- **Predictability:** Stakeholders can rely on regular delivery and planning cycles.
- **Rhythm:** Teams develop a natural working tempo that reduces coordination overhead.
- **Reduced transaction costs:** When events happen at predictable intervals, the cost of preparing for and participating in them decreases over time.
- **Forcing function:** Regular cadences force decisions, integration, and feedback that might otherwise be deferred indefinitely.

### Synchronization

While cadence provides rhythm, synchronization ensures alignment. Synchronization causes multiple perspectives, dependencies, and concerns to be understood, resolved, and integrated at the same time.

In SAFe, synchronization mechanisms include:

- **PI Planning:** A large-scale planning event where all teams on an Agile Release Train (ART) plan together, creating visibility into dependencies, risks, and shared objectives.
- **System Demos:** Regular demonstrations of the integrated system that synchronize understanding of what has been built.
- **Iteration boundaries:** When all teams on a train use the same iteration cadence, their work can be integrated and evaluated synchronously.
- **Scrum of Scrums:** Regular coordination meetings among team representatives.

### Cross-Domain Planning

Cross-domain planning brings together people from different functional areas, teams, and organizational levels to plan collaboratively. PI Planning is the primary cross-domain planning event in SAFe. It achieves:

- **Shared understanding:** Everyone sees the big picture and understands how their work contributes.
- **Dependency identification:** Dependencies between teams are surfaced and addressed before they become blocking issues.
- **Risk management:** Program-level risks are identified and mitigation strategies are developed collectively.
- **Commitment and alignment:** Teams commit to PI objectives, creating shared accountability.

### Managing Uncertainty

Development is inherently uncertain. Requirements change, technical challenges emerge, and market conditions shift. Cadence and synchronization do not eliminate uncertainty, but they provide mechanisms to manage it effectively. Regular synchronization points create opportunities to inspect, adapt, and realign -- ensuring that uncertainty does not accumulate into large, unmanageable problems.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Establish consistent iteration cadences.** All teams on an Agile Release Train should use the same iteration length and start/end dates. This enables synchronized planning, integration, and review.

2. **Define your PI cadence.** Establish a regular PI cadence (typically 8-12 weeks, comprising 4-5 iterations plus an Innovation and Planning iteration). Make this cadence non-negotiable -- consistency is essential for realizing the benefits.

3. **Conduct PI Planning rigorously.** PI Planning is the heartbeat of SAFe. Invest in making it effective:
   - Bring all team members together (in person or virtually).
   - Present the vision, roadmap, and top features.
   - Allow teams to plan in detail, identifying dependencies and risks.
   - Facilitate cross-team coordination and dependency resolution.
   - End with a commitment to PI objectives.

4. **Hold regular System Demos.** At the end of every iteration, demonstrate the integrated system to stakeholders. This is a synchronization point that ensures everyone sees the same reality.

5. **Use Scrum of Scrums for ongoing coordination.** Between planning events, maintain cross-team coordination through regular (often daily or weekly) Scrum of Scrums meetings where team representatives share progress and flag impediments.

6. **Synchronize supporting activities.** Align supporting activities -- such as infrastructure provisioning, security reviews, and compliance checks -- with the development cadence so they do not become asynchronous bottlenecks.

7. **Inspect and adapt at PI boundaries.** Use the Inspect & Adapt event at the end of each PI to assess performance, identify improvement opportunities, and create improvement backlog items. This closes the learning loop at the program level.

8. **Manage dependencies proactively.** Use the dependency visibility created during PI Planning and ongoing coordination to address dependencies before they block teams. Create explicit strategies for each dependency: resolve, accept, or mitigate.

9. **Resist the temptation to break cadence.** When pressures arise to extend a PI, skip a planning event, or shift iteration boundaries, resist. The value of cadence comes from its consistency. Breaking cadence undermines predictability and coordination.

10. **Scale synchronization for larger organizations.** For organizations with multiple ARTs, use Solution Train-level planning events and pre- and post-PI Planning sessions to synchronize across trains.

## Key Takeaway

Cadence provides predictability and rhythm; synchronization ensures alignment and coordination. Together, combined with periodic cross-domain planning events like PI Planning, they provide the mechanisms needed to operate effectively in large-scale development environments characterized by inherent uncertainty. Change technology professionals should focus on establishing and maintaining consistent cadences, investing heavily in the quality of synchronization events, and resisting pressures to break the rhythm. The discipline of regular cadence and synchronization is what transforms a collection of independent teams into a coordinated, aligned organization capable of delivering integrated solutions at scale.
