# Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)

A non-disclosure agreement (NDA), also known as a confidentiality agreement or proprietary information agreement, is a legally binding contract that establishes a confidential relationship between two or more parties. It governs the sharing, handling, and protection of sensitive information that one or both parties disclose during a business relationship. For technology professionals, NDAs are encountered frequently: during hiring, when evaluating vendors, in merger discussions, during investor pitches, and when collaborating with contractors or partners on proprietary software, algorithms, or trade secrets.

## Why NDAs Matter in Technology

Technology companies depend on intellectual property as a core competitive asset. Source code, system architectures, product roadmaps, customer data, pricing models, and unreleased features all represent information that could cause significant harm if disclosed to competitors or the public. An NDA creates a legal framework that allows parties to share this information with confidence, knowing that a breach carries enforceable consequences. Without NDAs, due diligence processes, technical partnerships, and even routine hiring would carry unacceptable risk.

## Types of NDAs

There are three primary forms of non-disclosure agreements, each suited to different circumstances.

| Type | Direction of Disclosure | Common Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **Unilateral (one-way)** | One party discloses; the other receives | Employee onboarding, contractor engagement, investor pitch |
| **Bilateral (mutual)** | Both parties disclose to each other | Joint ventures, partnership evaluations, M&A discussions |
| **Multilateral** | Three or more parties disclose among themselves | Multi-party research collaborations, consortium projects |

A bilateral NDA is the most common form in technology partnerships because both sides typically need to share proprietary information to evaluate a potential collaboration. Unilateral NDAs are standard during hiring, where the company discloses internal information to a candidate or new employee who has nothing reciprocal to protect.

## Key Provisions

A well-drafted NDA addresses several critical elements. Each provision shapes the scope, enforceability, and practical utility of the agreement.

- **Definition of confidential information**: Specifies exactly what information is covered. This may include source code, business plans, customer lists, financial data, trade secrets, and technical specifications. Broad definitions offer more protection but may face enforceability challenges; narrow definitions are easier to enforce but may leave gaps.
- **Exclusions from confidentiality**: Identifies categories of information that are not protected, such as information already publicly known, independently developed by the receiving party, or obtained from a third party without restriction.
- **Purpose and permitted use**: States the specific reason for sharing information and limits how the receiving party may use it. For example, an NDA for a vendor evaluation should restrict use to evaluating the vendor's product, not for developing a competing product.
- **Obligations of the receiving party**: Defines the standard of care the receiving party must apply, such as using "reasonable efforts" or the same degree of care it uses for its own confidential information.
- **Duration and survival**: Specifies how long the NDA remains in effect and how long confidentiality obligations persist after the agreement terminates. Technology NDAs commonly run two to five years, though trade secrets may be protected indefinitely.
- **Return or destruction of materials**: Requires the receiving party to return or destroy all confidential materials upon termination of the agreement or upon request.
- **Remedies for breach**: Outlines the consequences of a violation, typically including injunctive relief (a court order to stop further disclosure) and monetary damages. Many NDAs specify that monetary damages alone would be insufficient, entitling the disclosing party to seek an injunction.
- **Governing law and jurisdiction**: Identifies which jurisdiction's laws apply and where disputes will be resolved.

## Common Scenarios for Technology Professionals

Technology professionals encounter NDAs across a wide range of situations:

- **Employment and onboarding**: Most technology companies require employees to sign an NDA as part of their employment agreement. This protects proprietary code, internal tools, product strategies, and customer information.
- **Contractor and freelancer engagements**: When hiring external developers, designers, or consultants, NDAs ensure that work products and internal systems remain confidential.
- **Vendor and partner evaluations**: Before sharing API documentation, system architecture details, or integration specifications with a potential vendor, a mutual NDA is standard practice.
- **Mergers and acquisitions**: During due diligence, both the acquiring and target companies exchange sensitive financial, technical, and operational information under strict NDA terms.
- **Investor pitches**: Founders often share detailed product roadmaps, financial projections, and competitive analyses with potential investors. While many investors resist signing NDAs at the seed stage, later-stage investors and strategic investors commonly agree to them.
- **Open-source boundary management**: When a company maintains both open-source and proprietary codebases, NDAs help delineate what employees and contributors can discuss publicly versus what must remain confidential.

## Risks and Limitations

NDAs are powerful but not without limitations. Technology professionals should be aware of the following:

- **Overly broad definitions** can render an NDA unenforceable. Courts may decline to enforce agreements that attempt to classify all information as confidential without specificity.
- **Difficulty proving breach**: Demonstrating that a specific party was the source of a leak can be challenging, especially when multiple parties have access to similar information.
- **Jurisdictional variation**: NDA enforceability varies significantly across jurisdictions. What is enforceable in Delaware may not hold up in the European Union or in certain Asian markets.
- **No substitute for security practices**: An NDA is a legal tool, not a technical one. It does not prevent unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or insider threats. It must be paired with access controls, encryption, monitoring, and security awareness training.
- **Chilling effect on mobility**: Aggressive NDAs can restrict employees from taking new positions or discussing their experience, potentially raising legal and ethical concerns, particularly in jurisdictions like California where non-compete clauses are largely unenforceable.

## Best Practices

- Have legal counsel review every NDA before signing, especially if the agreement includes non-compete or non-solicitation clauses alongside the confidentiality terms.
- Negotiate the scope of "confidential information" to be specific enough to be enforceable and practical.
- Ensure the duration of confidentiality obligations is reasonable for the type of information being shared.
- Maintain records of what information was disclosed, to whom, and when, to support enforcement if a breach occurs.
- Use mutual NDAs whenever possible in partnership discussions to ensure balanced protection.
- Pair NDAs with technical controls such as role-based access, data loss prevention tools, and audit logging.

## Summary

A non-disclosure agreement is an essential legal instrument for technology professionals who regularly handle proprietary information, trade secrets, and sensitive business data. It establishes clear boundaries around what can and cannot be shared, defines the obligations of all parties, and provides legal recourse in the event of a breach. While NDAs are not a replacement for robust technical security measures, they form a critical layer in a comprehensive information protection strategy. Understanding the types, key provisions, common scenarios, and limitations of NDAs enables technology professionals to negotiate effectively, protect their organizations, and engage confidently in partnerships, hiring, and business development.
