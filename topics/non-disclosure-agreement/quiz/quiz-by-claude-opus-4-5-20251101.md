  <p>In a unilateral NDA, only one party discloses confidential information; in a bilateral NDA, both parties disclose confidential information to each other</p>
  <p>This distinction is fundamental to understanding NDAs. A unilateral NDA protects information flowing in one direction (e.g., a company sharing trade secrets with a potential investor). A bilateral NDA protects information flowing both ways (e.g., two companies exploring a partnership where each shares proprietary data). Choosing the correct type ensures appropriate legal protection for all parties involved.</p>
