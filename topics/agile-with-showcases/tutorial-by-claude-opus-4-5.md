# Agile with Showcases: Tutorial

## Overview

Agile showcases (also called sprint reviews or demos) are structured events where development teams demonstrate working software to stakeholders. A typical showcase is a time-boxed event -- often around 25 minutes weekly -- where everyone involved can look together at new features, improvements, and fixes in the working software. Showcases are a cornerstone of agile's commitment to delivering working software frequently and gathering real feedback from the people who matter most: users, product owners, and business stakeholders.

For change technology professionals, showcases are one of the most powerful tools for building stakeholder trust, validating direction, and ensuring that development work remains aligned with business needs. They close the feedback loop that makes iterative development effective.

## Key Concepts

### Purpose of Showcases

- **Demonstrate working software:** The primary purpose is to show what the team has actually built. This is not a slideshow or a status report -- it is a live demonstration of functional software.
- **Gather feedback:** Stakeholders see the work and provide input that shapes future priorities. This feedback is invaluable for course correction and ensures the product evolves based on real needs.
- **Build transparency:** Showcases make progress visible and tangible. Everyone can see what has been accomplished, what is working, and what needs attention.
- **Celebrate achievement:** Showcases recognize the team's accomplishments, boosting morale and reinforcing a culture of delivery.
- **Align stakeholders:** Bringing everyone together creates shared understanding of the product's current state and future direction.

### What Gets Showcased

Showcases should cover all significant work completed during the iteration. Typical items include:

- New features and capabilities
- Improvements to existing functionality (e.g., performance gains, usability enhancements)
- Bug fixes, especially those with visible user impact
- Technical infrastructure improvements that affect stakeholders (e.g., faster load times, improved reliability)
- Design changes and user interface updates

### Who Attends

- The development team (presenters)
- Product owner
- Business stakeholders and sponsors
- End users or user representatives
- Other interested teams or departments

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Schedule a Regular Cadence:** Establish a consistent showcase schedule -- weekly or at the end of each sprint. Consistency helps stakeholders plan their attendance and creates a reliable rhythm for feedback.

2. **Time-Box the Event:** Keep showcases focused and efficient. A common format is 25 minutes for a weekly showcase. Longer iterations may warrant longer showcases, but avoid letting them drag on. Respect everyone's time.

3. **Prepare Concise Summaries:** For each item being showcased, prepare a brief summary that covers:
   - What was built or fixed
   - Why it matters (the user or business value)
   - Key results (e.g., test outcomes, performance metrics, user feedback)

4. **Demonstrate Live Software:** Whenever possible, show the actual working software rather than screenshots or slides. Live demonstrations are more compelling and invite genuine feedback. If live demo is risky, a recorded walkthrough is an acceptable alternative.

5. **Invite the Right People:** Ensure that the stakeholders who can provide meaningful feedback are present. Also include anyone who needs visibility into the team's progress. Send calendar invitations well in advance and include a brief agenda.

6. **Encourage Questions and Feedback:** Build time into the showcase for stakeholder questions and discussion. This is not a one-way presentation -- it is a conversation. Capture feedback and feed it back into backlog prioritization.

7. **Keep it Accessible:** Avoid excessive technical jargon. Frame demonstrations in terms of user value and business outcomes. The showcase should be understandable to all attendees, not just developers.

8. **Track and Share Outcomes:** After the showcase, distribute a brief summary of what was demonstrated and any feedback received. This creates a record of progress and ensures that stakeholders who could not attend stay informed.

9. **Continuously Improve the Format:** Use retrospectives to assess whether showcases are effective. Ask: "Are stakeholders attending? Is the feedback useful? Does the team find the showcase valuable?" Adjust the format, frequency, or content based on what you learn.

## Key Takeaway

Agile showcases are the primary mechanism for closing the feedback loop between development teams and stakeholders. They transform abstract progress into tangible, visible results and create structured opportunities for feedback that shapes the product's direction. For change professionals, ensuring that showcases are well-run, well-attended, and genuinely collaborative is one of the highest-leverage activities for driving successful agile delivery. The key is to keep showcases focused on working software, invite genuine dialogue, and use the feedback to continuously improve both the product and the process.
