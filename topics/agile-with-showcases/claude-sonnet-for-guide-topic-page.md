# Agile with showcases

Agile showcases are ways to demonstrate working software to stakeholders. A typical way is to do a weekly showcase event time-boxed to 25 minutes, where everyone involved can look together at the new topics in the working software. Example summary items are below.

The authentication module reached completion with successful implementation of multi-factor authentication and single sign-on capabilities, passing all security tests and user acceptance criteria.

The data analytics dashboard has three new visualization components now functional. Users can generate custom reports, apply dynamic filters, and export data in multiple formats. Performance testing revealed 40% faster load times compared to the previous version, and initial user feedback indicates improved usability and clearer data presentation.

Mobile responsiveness improvements were successfully deployed across the customer portal. The responsive design now supports tablets and smartphones effectively, maintaining full functionality while adapting to different screen sizes. Cross-browser compatibility testing confirmed consistent performance across all major platforms.

Two critical bug fixes were resolved this week, including the intermittent payment processing timeout and the notification system delay. Both issues showed zero recurrence during regression testing, and production monitoring confirms stable performance since deployment.
