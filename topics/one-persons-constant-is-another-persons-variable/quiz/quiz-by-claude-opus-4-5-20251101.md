  <p>Coding styles and design choices vary among developers, requiring clear communication and documentation</p>
  <p>The saying highlights the subjective nature of coding decisions—what one developer treats as unchanging (a constant), another might need to vary based on their context or use case. This reinforces the importance of clear communication, thorough documentation, and being mindful of different perspectives when collaborating on code, so that design intent is understood by all team members.</p>
