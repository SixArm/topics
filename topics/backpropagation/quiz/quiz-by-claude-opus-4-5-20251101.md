# Backpropagation

Question: What is the primary purpose of backpropagation in training neural networks?

- [ ] To generate new training data by augmenting existing samples
- [ ] To minimize prediction error by adjusting weights and biases based on loss gradients
- [ ] To increase the number of layers in the neural network automatically
- [ ] To convert categorical data into numerical representations

  <p>To minimize prediction error by adjusting weights and biases based on loss gradients</p>
  <p>Backpropagation's main objective is to minimize the network's prediction error by iteratively adjusting the weights and biases of each neuron. It accomplishes this by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters using the chain rule of calculus, then propagating these gradients backward through the network layers to update parameters via gradient descent.</p>
