# Performance testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of stress testing in performance testing?

- [ ] To measure system behavior during sudden traffic spikes
- [ ] To measure application behavior under extreme loads beyond normal capacity
- [ ] To identify memory leaks over extended periods
- [ ] To measure response time under normal peak loads

  <p>To measure application behavior under extreme loads beyond normal capacity</p>
  <p>Stress testing specifically pushes the system to its limits and beyond normal capacity to identify performance degradation or failures. This differs from load testing (normal/peak loads), spike testing (sudden traffic increases), and endurance testing (extended time periods for issues like memory leaks).</p>
