  <p>Aligning channels with where the target audience is most active and the available budget</p>
  <p>Effective marketing channel selection requires matching channel choice to both the target audience's behaviors and the company's budget constraints. For technology startups, this typically means prioritizing digital channels like SEM, SEO, and social media where tech-savvy audiences spend time, rather than expensive broadcast media or trying to spread resources thin across all channels.</p>
