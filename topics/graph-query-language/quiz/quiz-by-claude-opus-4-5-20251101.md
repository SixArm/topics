# Graph Query Language (GraphQL)

Question: What is a key advantage of GraphQL over traditional REST APIs?

- [ ] It requires multiple round trips to fetch related data from different endpoints
- [ ] It always returns all available fields regardless of what the client needs
- [ ] Clients can specify exactly what data they need, and the server returns only that data
- [ ] It uses a loosely-typed API that allows any data structure

  <p>Clients can specify exactly what data they need, and the server returns only that data</p>
  <p>GraphQL's flexibility allows clients to request precisely the data they require. Unlike REST APIs where endpoints return fixed data structures, GraphQL reduces unnecessary data transfer over the network, improves performance, and reduces server load by returning only the requested fields in a single response.</p>
