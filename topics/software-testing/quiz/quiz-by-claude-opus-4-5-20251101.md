# Software testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of regression testing in software development?

- [ ] To verify the software's performance under heavy load conditions
- [ ] To ensure that individual software components function correctly in isolation
- [ ] To confirm that no new bugs have been introduced after code changes
- [ ] To validate that the software meets end-user expectations before deployment

  <p>To confirm that no new bugs have been introduced after code changes</p>
  <p>Regression testing is specifically performed after changes have been made to the software (such as bug fixes, new features, or refactoring) to ensure that these modifications have not inadvertently broken existing functionality or introduced new defects. This type of testing is critical for maintaining software quality throughout the development lifecycle, especially in agile environments with frequent releases.</p>
