# Definition of Technical Value (DoTV)

Technical Value in agile software engineering refers to the inherent worth and benefit that technical practices, decisions, and improvements bring to a software project beyond immediate functional requirements. Unlike business value, which focuses on customer-facing features and revenue generation, technical value encompasses the long-term health, maintainability, and sustainability of the software system.

Technical value manifests through various practices such as code refactoring, automated testing, continuous integration, architectural improvements, and debt reduction. These activities may not directly translate to visible user features but significantly impact the team's ability to deliver future functionality efficiently. For example, investing time in writing comprehensive unit tests or improving code documentation creates technical value by reducing debugging time and making future modifications easier.

In agile methodologies, technical value is often balanced against customer value during sprint planning and prioritization. Teams must advocate for technical improvements while demonstrating their connection to long-term project success. This includes faster development cycles, reduced bug rates, improved system performance, and enhanced team productivity. Technical value also encompasses knowledge sharing, skill development, and the establishment of coding standards that benefit the entire development team.

The challenge lies in quantifying technical value, as its benefits are often realized over time rather than immediately. Metrics such as code quality scores, deployment frequency, mean time to recovery, and technical debt measurements help teams communicate technical value to stakeholders. Successful agile teams recognize that sustainable delivery requires continuous investment in technical value alongside customer value.
