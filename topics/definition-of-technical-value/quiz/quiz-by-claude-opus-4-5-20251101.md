  <p>Technical value refers to the long-term health, maintainability, and sustainability of a software system, whereas business value focuses on customer-facing features and revenue generation</p>
  <p>Technical value encompasses practices like code refactoring, automated testing, continuous integration, architectural improvements, and debt reduction. These activities may not directly translate to visible user features but significantly impact the team's ability to deliver future functionality efficiently. The challenge with technical value is that its benefits are often realized over time rather than immediately, which is why metrics such as code quality scores, deployment frequency, and technical debt measurements help teams communicate its importance to stakeholders.</p>
