# Agile and Programme Management: Tutorial

## Overview

Agile programme management extends agile principles beyond individual projects to coordinate multiple interconnected initiatives. It involves managing dependencies, aligning resources, and ensuring consistent delivery across multiple teams while preserving the adaptability that makes agile effective.

## How Programme Management Differs from Project Management

- **Project management** focuses on delivering a specific scope within defined constraints (a single product or initiative)
- **Programme management** coordinates multiple related projects that collectively contribute to a strategic objective

In agile contexts, programme management ensures that multiple agile teams—each working independently in sprints—remain aligned with each other and with broader organizational goals.

## Key Responsibilities

### Dependency Management

When multiple teams work on interconnected systems, changes by one team can affect others. Programme managers:

- Identify dependencies between teams early
- Coordinate delivery sequences to prevent blocking
- Facilitate cross-team communication about shared components
- Establish integration points and testing strategies

### Strategic Alignment

Programme managers ensure that the collective output of multiple teams advances organizational strategy:

- Translating strategic objectives into programme-level goals
- Aligning team backlogs with programme priorities
- Balancing resource allocation across teams based on strategic value
- Tracking progress toward programme-level outcomes

### Risk Management

At the programme level, risks include:

- Dependencies between teams creating cascading delays
- Resource contention across multiple initiatives
- Integration failures between independently developed components
- Strategic shifts that require reprioritization across multiple teams

### Stakeholder Communication

Programme managers provide consolidated visibility into the status and direction of multiple teams:

- Aggregating progress from multiple team-level metrics
- Communicating programme-level risks and trade-offs
- Aligning stakeholder expectations across multiple initiatives

## Scaling Frameworks for Programme Management

### SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)

Organizes work into Agile Release Trains (ARTs) that coordinate multiple teams around a shared mission. SAFe provides structured ceremonies for cross-team planning, integration, and review.

### LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)

Extends Scrum to multiple teams working on a single product. LeSS minimizes additional process, relying on shared backlogs, joint sprint planning, and common retrospectives.

### Nexus

A Scrum-based framework that coordinates 3-9 Scrum teams working on a single product backlog, with an integration team that manages cross-team dependencies.

## Practical Steps

1. **Map dependencies explicitly**: Create and maintain a visual map of dependencies between teams. Update it regularly during cross-team coordination meetings.
2. **Establish regular synchronization points**: Hold programme-level ceremonies (e.g., Scrum of Scrums, PI Planning) to align teams and address cross-cutting concerns.
3. **Minimize dependencies where possible**: Reorganize teams and architectures to reduce coupling between teams. Fewer dependencies mean less coordination overhead.
4. **Use programme-level metrics**: Track metrics that reflect programme outcomes—overall time-to-market, cross-team integration quality, strategic objective completion—not just individual team performance.
5. **Balance structure with autonomy**: Provide enough coordination to prevent chaos without imposing so much process that teams lose their agility.

## Key Takeaway

Agile programme management is the art of coordinating multiple agile teams toward shared strategic objectives without undermining their individual agility. It requires deliberate dependency management, strategic alignment, and cross-team communication—all while preserving the autonomy and adaptability that make each team effective.
