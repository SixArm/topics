## Best Practices

Experienced systems administrators follow a set of operational best practices that minimize risk and maximize reliability.

- **Automate Everything Repeatable**: Any task performed more than twice should be scripted or codified. Automation reduces human error, improves consistency, and frees time for higher-value work.

- **Document Proactively**: Maintain runbooks, architecture diagrams, and change logs in version-controlled repositories. Documentation written during implementation is far more accurate than documentation written after the fact.

- **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users and services only the minimum permissions required to perform their functions. Regularly audit access controls and revoke unnecessary privileges.

- **Test Backups Regularly**: A backup that has never been tested is not a backup. Schedule periodic restore tests to verify data integrity and measure recovery time.

- **Monitor Before You Need To**: Establish baseline metrics and alerting thresholds before problems occur. Proactive monitoring enables early detection and prevents minor issues from becoming major outages.

- **Plan for Failure**: Design systems with redundancy and failover in mind. Assume that any component can fail and architect accordingly.

- **Manage Change Carefully**: Use change management processes to evaluate, approve, and document all infrastructure changes. Even small changes can have cascading effects in complex environments.
