  <p>Developing and implementing data backup and recovery strategies</p>
  <p>While all options are valid Sysadmin responsibilities, data backup and recovery is the most critical function for business continuity. This involves scheduling regular backups, performing data restores when needed, and testing backup procedures to ensure critical data can be recovered after system failures, disasters, or security incidents. Without effective backup and recovery, organizations risk permanent data loss that could severely impact operations.</p>
