  <p>Maximizing data collection without user consent to improve model accuracy</p>
  <p>AI ethics requires respecting user privacy, implementing appropriate security measures, and obtaining informed consent when collecting and using personal data. Maximizing data collection without consent directly violates the privacy principle of AI ethics. The other options—transparency, fairness, and accountability—are all recognized key aspects of ethical AI development and deployment.</p>
