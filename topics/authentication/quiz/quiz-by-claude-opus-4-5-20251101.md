  <p>A method requiring two or more forms of identification before granting access</p>
  <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) strengthens security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification—such as something they know (password), something they have (one-time code from a mobile app), or something they are (biometric)—before access is granted. This layered approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if one factor is compromised.</p>
