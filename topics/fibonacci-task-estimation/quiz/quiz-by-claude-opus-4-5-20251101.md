# Fibonacci task estimation

Question: Why does Fibonacci task estimation use a nonlinear sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) rather than a linear sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...)?

- [ ] It makes the estimation process faster by limiting available options
- [ ] It reflects that effort grows nonlinearly as task complexity increases
- [ ] It is easier for team members to memorize than other sequences
- [ ] It allows for more precise estimates on large tasks

  <p>It reflects that effort grows nonlinearly as task complexity increases</p>
  <p>Fibonacci task estimation is based on the principle that as tasks increase in complexity, the effort required tends to grow in a nonlinear manner. The gaps between Fibonacci numbers increase as the numbers get larger, which acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in estimating larger, more complex tasks. This approach discourages false precision and encourages teams to recognize that bigger tasks carry more uncertainty.</p>
