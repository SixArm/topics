- [ ] To deploy the software to end-users and provide training
- [ ] To write code and create the software based on design documents
- [ ] To identify the functional and non-functional requirements by understanding what users need and want from the software
- [ ] To update and maintain the software with bug fixes and security updates

  <p>To identify the functional and non-functional requirements by understanding what users need and want from the software</p>
  <p>The Requirements Gathering and Analysis phase is critical because it establishes the foundation for the entire project. Through interviews, surveys, and research, teams identify both functional requirements (what the software must do) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability constraints). Getting this phase right ensures the final product meets users' actual needs and prevents costly rework later in the development process.</p>
