# Version control

Question: What is the key difference between centralized version control systems (CVCS) and distributed version control systems (DVCS)?

- [ ] CVCS allows branching and merging, while DVCS does not
- [ ] DVCS requires an internet connection at all times, while CVCS works offline
- [ ] CVCS stores files on a central server, while DVCS gives each user a complete copy of the repository
- [ ] CVCS is only used for code, while DVCS can manage any type of file

  <p>CVCS stores files on a central server, while DVCS gives each user a complete copy of the repository</p>
  <p>Centralized version control systems have a central server that stores all files and their changes, meaning users must connect to this server to access the full history. Distributed version control systems do not have a central server; instead, each user has a complete copy of the files and their entire change history, enabling offline work and providing redundancy.</p>
