# Bradford-Hill criteria

Question: Which Bradford-Hill criterion requires that exposure must occur before the outcome to establish a causal relationship?

- [ ] Biological Gradient
- [ ] Consistency
- [ ] Temporality
- [ ] Plausibility

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Temporality</p>
  <p>Temporality is the only Bradford-Hill criterion that is absolutely essential for causality. It states that the exposure must precede the outcome in time—a cause must come before its effect. Without temporal precedence, a causal relationship cannot exist. This is critical for technology professionals when analyzing data correlations, debugging systems, or evaluating A/B test results to ensure they don't confuse correlation with causation.</p>
