# 83(b) election

## Introduction

The 83(b) election is a provision in the United States Internal Revenue Code (IRC Section 83(b)) that allows employees, founders, and other service providers to accelerate the tax recognition of equity compensation. Instead of paying taxes when restricted stock vests — potentially at a much higher valuation — the recipient elects to be taxed on the fair market value at the time of grant. For technology professionals working at startups or high-growth companies, understanding the 83(b) election is one of the most consequential financial decisions tied to equity compensation.

## How Equity Taxation Works Without an 83(b) Election

When an employee or contractor receives equity such as restricted stock as compensation, the default tax treatment under IRC Section 83 is straightforward: the recipient owes ordinary income tax on the fair market value of the shares at the time they vest and become transferable, minus any amount paid for the shares. In a startup context, this creates a serious problem. If shares are granted early when the company is worth very little, but vest over four years while the company grows rapidly, the tax bill at each vesting event can be enormous — even though the recipient has not sold any shares and has no cash to pay the tax.

## What the 83(b) Election Does

By filing an 83(b) election, the recipient tells the IRS: "Tax me now, on the current value, not later when the shares vest." The recipient pays ordinary income tax on the difference between the fair market value at the time of grant and the price paid (if any) for the shares. Any future appreciation is then taxed as capital gains — either short-term or long-term depending on the holding period — rather than as ordinary income.

## Filing Requirements and Deadlines

The 83(b) election must be filed within 30 calendar days of the equity grant date. There are no extensions and no exceptions to this deadline. Missing it means the election is lost permanently for that grant.

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Filing deadline | 30 calendar days from the grant date |
| Filed with | IRS Service Center for the recipient's tax return |
| Singed copy to | Employer, for their records |
| Tax return attachment | Copy must be attached to the annual tax return for the grant year |
| Revocability | Irrevocable once filed |
| Filing method | Mail (certified mail with return receipt recommended) or, in some cases, electronic |

## When the 83(b) Election Is Advantageous

The election is most beneficial in the following scenarios:

- **Early-stage startup equity**: When shares are granted at a very low fair market value (fractions of a penny to a few cents per share), the tax owed at grant time is negligible. If the company later reaches a valuation of tens or hundreds of dollars per share, the recipient avoids paying ordinary income tax on that entire increase.
- **High-growth companies**: Founders and early employees at companies expected to appreciate significantly benefit the most, since the spread between grant-time value and vest-time value can be massive.
- **Long vesting schedules**: With a typical four-year vesting schedule, the compounding effect of value growth means more tax savings from an early election.
- **Long-term capital gains treatment**: By starting the capital gains holding period at the grant date rather than the vesting date, the recipient can qualify for long-term capital gains rates (which are lower than ordinary income rates) sooner.

## When the 83(b) Election Is Risky

The election is not without downside. Because it is irrevocable, the recipient bears real financial risk:

- **Forfeited shares**: If the recipient leaves the company before shares vest, they forfeit unvested shares but do not get a refund of taxes already paid on them. The IRS treats forfeiture as a capital loss, which is less favorable than never having paid the tax at all.
- **Company failure**: If the startup fails and the shares become worthless, the taxes paid at grant time are a sunk cost with only a capital loss deduction to offset future gains.
- **Overpayment risk**: If the fair market value at grant time is already substantial (for example, at a later-stage company), the upfront tax bill may be significant and the future appreciation may not justify the early payment.

## Comparison: With and Without an 83(b) Election

| Factor | Without 83(b) | With 83(b) |
|---|---|---|
| When taxed | At each vesting event | At the grant date |
| Tax type on appreciation | Ordinary income | Capital gains |
| Tax rate on appreciation | Up to 37% (federal) | Up to 20% long-term capital gains |
| Risk if shares are forfeited | No tax was paid on unvested shares | Taxes paid on forfeited shares are not refunded |
| Holding period starts | At vesting date | At grant date |
| Cash flow timing | Tax spread across vesting schedule | Tax due upfront |

## Practical Steps for Filing

1. Complete IRS Form 83(b) (there is no official form — a written statement meeting IRS requirements is sufficient).
2. Include the following in the statement: taxpayer name, address, Social Security number, description of the property, the date of transfer, the taxable year, the restriction details, the fair market value at grant, and the amount paid.
3. Send the election to the IRS within 30 days via certified mail with return receipt requested.
4. Provide a copy to the employer.
5. Retain a copy for personal records and attach a copy to the annual tax return.

## Common Mistakes

- **Missing the 30-day deadline**: This is the single most common and costly mistake. Calendar the deadline immediately upon receiving a grant.
- **Confusing stock options with restricted stock**: The 83(b) election applies to restricted stock and early-exercised stock options, not to unexercised stock options or RSUs that settle in cash.
- **Failing to send the election to the employer**: The employer needs a copy for their own tax reporting obligations.
- **Not consulting a tax advisor**: Individual circumstances (AMT exposure, state taxes, liquidity) vary widely and affect whether the election makes sense.

Technology professionals working with equity compensation should also study restricted stock units (RSUs), stock option grants, 409A valuations, vesting schedules, the alternative minimum tax (AMT), capital gains tax treatment, employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), capitalization tables, and the tax implications of startup liquidity events such as acquisitions and initial public offerings (IPOs).

## Summary

The 83(b) election is a powerful tax planning tool for technology professionals who receive restricted stock or exercise stock options early at a startup or high-growth company. By electing to pay taxes on the fair market value at the time of grant — typically when the value is minimal — recipients can convert future appreciation from ordinary income into capital gains, potentially saving substantial amounts in taxes. However, the election is irrevocable, carries real risk if shares are forfeited or the company fails, and must be filed within a strict 30-day window. Given its complexity and consequences, the decision should always be made in consultation with a qualified tax professional.
