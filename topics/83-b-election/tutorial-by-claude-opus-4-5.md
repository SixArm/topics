## The 83(b) Election: A Comprehensive Guide for Technology Professionals

## What Is an 83(b) Election?

An 83(b) election is a provision under Section 83(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code that allows you to pay income taxes on the fair market value of equity compensation at the time of grant rather than at the time of vesting. This is a critical tax planning tool for startup employees, founders, and anyone receiving restricted stock as compensation.

When you receive equity subject to vesting, the IRS normally taxes you when the stock vests—when you have full ownership rights. The 83(b) election lets you accelerate that tax event to the grant date, potentially saving substantial money if the company's value increases.

## Why This Matters for Technology Professionals

In the technology industry, equity compensation is a cornerstone of total compensation. Startups routinely grant restricted stock to early employees, and the difference between a company's valuation at grant versus at IPO or acquisition can be enormous. An 83(b) election made when shares are worth pennies can save hundreds of thousands—or millions—in taxes.

## How the 83(b) Election Works

### Standard Taxation Without 83(b)

Without an 83(b) election, equity compensation is taxed as ordinary income when it vests. The taxable amount equals the fair market value at vesting minus any amount you paid for the shares.

### Taxation With 83(b)

With an 83(b) election, you pay ordinary income tax on the fair market value at the grant date (minus any purchase price). All subsequent appreciation is taxed as capital gains when you eventually sell—potentially at much lower rates.

## Comparison: With vs. Without 83(b) Election

| Factor | Without 83(b) | With 83(b) |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **When taxed** | At vesting | At grant |
| **Taxable amount** | FMV at vesting minus purchase price | FMV at grant minus purchase price |
| **Tax rate on appreciation** | Ordinary income (up to 37%) | Capital gains (0-20%) |
| **Risk if you leave early** | No tax paid on unvested shares | Tax already paid; no refund |
| **Risk if stock value drops** | Pay less tax on lower value | May have overpaid taxes |

## Practical Example

Consider an engineer joining an early-stage startup:

- **Shares granted:** 100,000 restricted shares
- **Purchase price:** $0.001 per share ($100 total)
- **FMV at grant:** $0.10 per share ($10,000 total)
- **FMV at vesting (4 years later):** $10.00 per share ($1,000,000 total)
- **Sale price (1 year after vesting):** $15.00 per share ($1,500,000 total)

### Without 83(b) Election

- **At vesting:** Ordinary income tax on $999,900 (FMV minus purchase price)
- **At sale:** Capital gains tax on $500,000 (sale price minus vesting FMV)
- **Total taxable as ordinary income:** $999,900

### With 83(b) Election

- **At grant:** Ordinary income tax on $9,900 (FMV minus purchase price)
- **At sale:** Long-term capital gains tax on $1,490,000 (sale price minus grant FMV)
- **Total taxable as ordinary income:** $9,900

The difference in tax rates between ordinary income (up to 37% federal) and long-term capital gains (up to 20% federal) can result in savings exceeding $150,000 in this scenario.

## Critical Requirements and Deadlines

The 83(b) election has strict requirements that must be followed precisely:

- **30-day deadline:** You must file the election within 30 calendar days of receiving the equity. This deadline is absolute and cannot be extended for any reason.
- **Written election:** The election must be in writing and include specific information about the transaction.
- **IRS filing:** Send the election to the IRS service center where you file your tax return.
- **Employer copy:** Provide a copy to your employer.
- **Tax return attachment:** Attach a copy to your tax return for the year of the grant.

## What to Include in Your 83(b) Election

Your election letter must contain:

- Your name, address, and Social Security number
- Description of the property (number and class of shares)
- Date of transfer and taxable year
- Nature of the restriction (vesting schedule)
- Fair market value at time of transfer
- Amount paid for the property
- Statement that you're making the election under Section 83(b)

## When an 83(b) Election Makes Sense

An 83(b) election is typically advantageous when:

- The current FMV is low (early-stage company)
- You have high confidence the company will significantly increase in value
- The tax due at grant is affordable
- You plan to stay with the company through vesting
- You can hold the shares long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains

## When to Avoid an 83(b) Election

Consider skipping the election when:

- The FMV at grant is already high
- You're uncertain about staying with the company
- You cannot afford the immediate tax payment
- The company's future is highly uncertain
- You're receiving stock options (different rules apply)

## Key Risks to Understand

### Forfeiture Risk

If you leave the company before your shares vest, you forfeit the unvested shares. The IRS does not refund taxes paid on forfeited shares. You can claim a capital loss, but this provides limited benefit compared to the ordinary income tax already paid.

### Declining Value Risk

If the company's value decreases, you may have paid more in taxes at grant than you would have at vesting. The election is irrevocable—you cannot change your mind.

### Liquidity Risk

You must pay taxes immediately even though you cannot sell the shares. Ensure you have sufficient cash or other resources to cover the tax bill.

## 83(b) and Different Equity Types

| Equity Type | 83(b) Applicable? | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Restricted Stock** | Yes | Most common use case |
| **Stock Options (ISOs)** | No | Different tax treatment under Section 422 |
| **Stock Options (NSOs)** | Sometimes | Only if exercised early |
| **RSUs** | Generally No | No property transfer until vesting |
| **Profits Interests (LLCs)** | Yes | Common for LLC equity |

## Filing Process Step by Step

1. **Receive your equity grant** — Confirm the grant date and FMV with your employer.
2. **Prepare the election letter** — Include all required information.
3. **File with the IRS within 30 days** — Send via certified mail with return receipt requested.
4. **Provide copy to employer** — Keep proof of delivery.
5. **Retain copy for your records** — You'll need this for future tax returns.
6. **Attach copy to tax return** — Include with your return for the grant year.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Missing the 30-day deadline** — There are no exceptions or extensions.
- **Filing with the wrong IRS address** — Use the correct service center for your region.
- **Failing to keep proof of filing** — Certified mail provides evidence of timely submission.
- **Not consulting a tax advisor** — The election has significant financial implications.
- **Confusing stock options with restricted stock** — They have different tax treatments.

## Working With Your Tax Professional

Before making an 83(b) election, discuss these factors with a qualified tax advisor:

- Your current and projected tax brackets
- State tax implications (varies significantly by state)
- Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) considerations
- Your personal liquidity situation
- The company's realistic growth prospects
- Your confidence in remaining with the company

## Summary

The 83(b) election is a powerful tax planning tool that can save technology professionals substantial money on equity compensation. The key trade-off is paying taxes earlier in exchange for potentially lower rates on appreciation. The strict 30-day deadline and irrevocable nature of the election make it essential to act quickly and thoughtfully when receiving restricted stock. For early-stage startup employees receiving low-value shares, filing an 83(b) election is often one of the most impactful financial decisions of their careers.
