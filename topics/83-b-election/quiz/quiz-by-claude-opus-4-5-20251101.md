  <p>It enables you to pay taxes on the equity's value at grant time, potentially avoiding higher taxes on future appreciation</p>
  <p>The 83(b) election allows employees to pay taxes on the fair market value of equity at the time of grant—when the value is typically low—rather than at vesting when the equity may have appreciated significantly. This can result in substantial tax savings if the company's value increases, since the appreciation is not taxed as ordinary income at vesting.</p>
