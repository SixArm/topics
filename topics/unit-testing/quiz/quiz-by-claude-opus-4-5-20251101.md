  <p>To validate that each individual unit of software performs as expected</p>
  <p>Unit testing focuses on verifying the smallest testable parts of an application (such as methods, functions, classes, or modules) in isolation. By testing each unit independently, developers can catch defects early in the development cycle, reduce the cost of fixing bugs, and ensure code quality and maintainability.</p>
