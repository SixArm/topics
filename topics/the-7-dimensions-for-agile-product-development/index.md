# The 7 dimensions for agile product development

Agile product development operates across seven interconnected dimensions that collectively shape successful software engineering outcomes.

* **User**: focus on understanding stakeholder needs, personas, and user journeys. This ensures development is customer-centric, prioritized, and validated throughout iterative cycles.

* **Interface** focus on touchpoints where users interact with the system, including user interfaces, APIs, and integration points.

* **Action** bridges user needs with technical implementation. This translates user goals into runnable features.

* **Data** addresses information models, schemas, structures, storage, and flow throughout the system.

* **Control** encompasses system logic, business rules, algorithms, and decision-making processes. This ensures that the software behaves correctly during continuous improvement.

* **Environment** includes the technical infrastructure, continuous pipelines, deployment contexts, and operational considerations.

* **Quality Attribute** spans non-functional requirements such as performance, security, scalability, and maintainability. Quality attributes are woven throughout the development process.
