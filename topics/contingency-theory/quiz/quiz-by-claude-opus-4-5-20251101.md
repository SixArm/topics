  <p>Effective leadership depends on matching leadership approach to situational factors</p>
  <p>Contingency theory, also known as the situational approach, holds that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to leadership. Instead, effective leadership is contingent upon various situational factors including the characteristics of the followers, the nature of the task or situation, and the external environment. Leaders must be flexible and adaptable, assessing each situation and adjusting their leadership behaviors accordingly.</p>
