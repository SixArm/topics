  <p>To establish a formal legal framework for parties pooling resources and expertise to achieve a common business goal</p>
  <p>A joint venture agreement (JVA) is a legal agreement between two or more parties who agree to work together on a specific business project or activity. Unlike a merger, the parties remain separate entities while collaborating. The JVA defines key components such as purpose, parties' roles and responsibilities, financial arrangements for sharing profits and losses, management and control structures, term duration, and termination consequences.</p>
