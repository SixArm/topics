  <p>Leveraging both internal and external sources of ideas and expertise to drive innovation</p>
  <p>Open innovation fundamentally differs from closed innovation by recognizing that valuable ideas and expertise can come from both internal and external sources. Rather than relying solely on internal R&D, open innovation emphasizes collaboration, knowledge sharing, and integration of external inputs through partnerships, crowdsourcing, startup engagement, and ecosystem development to create value and drive innovation.</p>
