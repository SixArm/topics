  <p>To promote national security, protect public health, and safeguard economic interests</p>
  <p>Cross-border controls encompass immigration controls, customs and trade regulations, and financial controls. These measures are designed to balance multiple objectives: ensuring national security, protecting public health, and safeguarding economic interests—while governments must also balance these protections against the benefits of international trade, investment, and cooperation through mechanisms like trade agreements and investment treaties.</p>
