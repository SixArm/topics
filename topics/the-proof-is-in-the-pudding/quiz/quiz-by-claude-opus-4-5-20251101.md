  <p>The value of practical results and real-world testing over theoretical arguments</p>
  <p>The idiom "the proof is in the pudding" (derived from "the proof of the pudding is in the eating") emphasizes that the effectiveness or quality of something can only be determined by putting it to the test or trying it out. In technology and business contexts, this means that practical experience, experimentation, and actual results matter more than theoretical arguments or assumptions—you need to launch, test, and observe real outcomes to truly validate an idea or product.</p>
