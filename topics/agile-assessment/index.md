# Agile assessment

Agile assessment is an evaluation process that measures how effectively teams and organizations implement agile methodologies in software development. This examines various aspects of agile adoption, including team dynamics, process adherence, delivery velocity, and overall organizational maturity in embracing agile principles.

The assessment typically evaluates key performance indicators such as customer satisfaction scores, delivery of customer value, and agile manifesto alignment. Teams are analyzed on their ability to collaborate effectively, respond to change, deliver working software, and maintain sustainable development practices. The evaluation also considers how well organizations support agile through appropriate training and leadership.

Common assessment methods include customer interviews and analysis of agile metrics for business value and technical value. These approaches help identify bottlenecks, communication gaps, and areas where agile practices may not be fully realized. The assessment examines whether teams are truly embracing agile values or merely following prescribed processes without understanding their underlying purpose.

Results from agile assessments drive continuous improvement initiatives, helping organizations refine their approach to software development. They reveal whether teams are achieving the promised benefits of agility: faster value, improved quality, better stakeholder collaboration, and enhanced adaptability to change. Assessment findings often highlight the need for additional coaching, process adjustments, or organizational changes to support agile transformation.
