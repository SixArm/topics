  <p>To measure and drive continuous improvement in agile adoption effectiveness</p>
  <p>Agile assessment evaluates how effectively teams and organizations implement agile methodologies by examining team dynamics, process adherence, delivery velocity, and organizational maturity. The results drive continuous improvement initiatives, helping organizations refine their approach and achieve the benefits of agility: faster value delivery, improved quality, better stakeholder collaboration, and enhanced adaptability to change. The assessment also identifies whether teams are truly embracing agile values rather than merely following processes without understanding their purpose.</p>
