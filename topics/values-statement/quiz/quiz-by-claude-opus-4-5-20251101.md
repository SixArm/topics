  <p>To articulate the fundamental principles that guide how the business operates</p>
  <p>A values statement communicates the core principles and beliefs that guide behavior and decisions. Unlike a mission statement (what the business does) or vision statement (where it wants to go), a values statement establishes the fundamental principles driving how the organization operates, creating a framework for conduct, stakeholder interactions, and goal achievement.</p>
