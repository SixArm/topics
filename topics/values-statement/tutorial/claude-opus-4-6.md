# Values statement

A values statement is a concise, written declaration that communicates the core principles and beliefs guiding the behavior and decisions of an organization. It expresses the company's ideals and provides a framework for how the organization conducts its affairs, interacts with stakeholders, and achieves its goals. For technology professionals, values statements shape engineering culture, influence hiring decisions, and establish expectations for how teams build products, handle data, and serve users. A strong values statement is not aspirational decoration — it is a working document that informs daily tradeoffs and strategic priorities.

## How a values statement differs from mission and vision

A values statement serves a distinct role compared to other foundational organizational statements. Understanding the differences prevents confusion and ensures each statement fulfills its purpose.

| Statement | Focus | Question It Answers | Time Orientation | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mission statement | Purpose and core function | What do we do and for whom? | Present | "We organize the world's information and make it universally accessible." |
| Vision statement | Aspirational future state | Where do we want to go? | Future | "A world where every person has access to reliable information." |
| Values statement | Guiding principles and beliefs | How do we operate and make decisions? | Ongoing | "We act with transparency, prioritize user trust, and build inclusively." |

While a mission statement outlines what the business does and a vision statement describes where it wants to go, a values statement articulates the fundamental principles that drive how the business operates. All three are complementary, but the values statement is the one most directly tied to everyday behavior and culture.

## Core components of a values statement

A well-crafted values statement typically includes a focused set of core values that reflect the company's culture and beliefs. These values serve as a guide for employees and other stakeholders. Common elements include:

- **Principle identification**: A curated list of three to seven core values, each named clearly and concisely. Going beyond seven tends to dilute focus.
- **Behavioral descriptions**: Each value is accompanied by a brief explanation of what it looks like in practice, removing ambiguity about expectations.
- **Prioritization signals**: The best values statements acknowledge that values can conflict and provide guidance on which principles take precedence. For example, stating that user safety outweighs speed of delivery.
- **Organizational voice**: The language and tone reflect the company's authentic identity rather than generic corporate phrasing.

## Common values in technology organizations

Technology companies frequently adopt values that reflect the unique demands of software development, data stewardship, and rapid innovation. The following values appear across many technology-oriented values statements:

- **Integrity and honesty**: Committing to truthful communication with customers, partners, and teammates, especially when reporting metrics, incidents, or product limitations.
- **User focus**: Centering product decisions on genuine user needs rather than internal convenience or vanity metrics.
- **Transparency**: Sharing information openly within the organization, including about failures, outages, and business performance.
- **Continuous learning**: Encouraging experimentation, tolerating informed failure, and investing in professional growth.
- **Respect and inclusion**: Building teams and products that serve diverse populations and creating environments where all contributors can do their best work.
- **Accountability**: Owning outcomes rather than deflecting responsibility, particularly in incident response and product quality.
- **Collaboration and teamwork**: Valuing cross-functional cooperation over siloed expertise.

## Why values statements matter for technology teams

The values statement is an important tool because it helps define and communicate the organization's identity and purpose, and aligns the behavior and decisions of employees with the company's goals. For technology professionals specifically, a values statement provides several concrete benefits:

- **Decision-making framework**: When engineers face tradeoffs — such as shipping faster versus writing more tests, or collecting more data versus protecting user privacy — values provide a tiebreaker that does not require escalation to management.
- **Hiring and retention**: Candidates increasingly evaluate prospective employers by their stated and demonstrated values. A clear values statement helps attract people who share the organization's principles.
- **Incident and crisis response**: During outages, security breaches, or ethical dilemmas, teams that have internalized organizational values respond more consistently and with less hesitation.
- **Culture at scale**: As organizations grow, values statements help maintain cultural coherence across distributed teams, time zones, and business units.
- **Stakeholder trust**: Demonstrating a commitment to ethical and responsible business practices builds credibility with customers, suppliers, investors, and regulators.

## Crafting an effective values statement

Writing a values statement that actually influences behavior requires deliberate effort. The following guidelines help technology leaders create statements that are meaningful rather than performative:

| Guideline | Description |
|---|---|
| Be specific | Avoid generic platitudes like "excellence" without defining what excellence means in your context. |
| Be honest | Only claim values the organization genuinely practices. Aspirational values should be labeled as such. |
| Involve the team | Values created by leadership in isolation rarely resonate. Include diverse voices from across the organization. |
| Make them actionable | Each value should translate into observable behaviors that can be recognized and reinforced. |
| Accept tradeoffs | Acknowledge that values sometimes conflict, and state which ones take priority in those situations. |
| Revisit periodically | As the organization evolves, values should be reviewed to ensure they remain relevant and authentic. |

## Common pitfalls

Organizations frequently undermine their values statements through avoidable mistakes:

- **Values-behavior gap**: Stating values that leadership visibly contradicts erodes trust faster than having no values statement at all.
- **Too many values**: Listing ten or more values makes prioritization impossible and signals a lack of clarity.
- **Generic language**: Values like "innovation" or "teamwork" without context are indistinguishable from any other company and provide no real guidance.
- **Set and forget**: Publishing a values statement once and never referencing it again renders it irrelevant.
- **Lack of accountability**: Without mechanisms to evaluate adherence — such as performance reviews, retrospectives, or cultural surveys — values remain aspirational rather than operational.

## Related

Technology professionals exploring values statements should also study mission statements and vision statements to understand how all three foundational documents work together. Organizational culture, leadership values, and corporate social responsibility provide broader context for why values matter. Code of conduct and code of ethics documents translate values into specific behavioral expectations. Objectives and key results (OKRs) offer a complementary framework for aligning goals with values. Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) initiatives often flow directly from values commitments.

## Summary

A values statement is a foundational document that articulates the core principles guiding how an organization operates, makes decisions, and treats its stakeholders. It differs from mission and vision statements by focusing on the enduring "how" rather than the "what" or "where." For technology professionals, a well-crafted values statement serves as a practical decision-making framework, a cultural anchor during growth, and a trust-building signal to customers and partners. Its effectiveness depends on specificity, honesty, leadership commitment, and regular reinforcement — values that exist only on a wall or a wiki page provide no value at all.
