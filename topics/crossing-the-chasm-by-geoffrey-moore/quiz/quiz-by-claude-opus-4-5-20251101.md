  <p>The gap between early adopters and the early majority of mainstream consumers</p>
  <p>Moore argues that the most critical challenge for technology companies is bridging the gap between early adopters (who are willing to take risks on new technology) and the early majority (who are more cautious and want proven value before adopting). This chasm exists because these two groups have fundamentally different buying behaviors and expectations, making it difficult for companies to transition from initial success with enthusiasts to mainstream market acceptance.</p>
