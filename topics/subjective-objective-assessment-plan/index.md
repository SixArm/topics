# Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan (SOAP)

The SOAP note (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) is a standardized
method of clinical documentation used by healthcare providers—including
physicians, therapists, and social workers—to record patient encounters in a
structured and professional manner. Developed by Dr. Lawrence Weed in the 1960s,
it serves as a "cognitive framework" for clinical reasoning and ensures clear
communication across multidisciplinary care teams. 

Components:
- **Subjective (S):** Captures the patient’s own perspective and verbal reports.
- **Chief Complaint (CC):** The primary reason for the visit.
- **History of Present Illness (HPI):** Often detailed using mnemonics like OLDCARTS (Onset, Location, Duration, Characterization, Alleviating/Aggravating factors, Radiation, Temporal patterns, Severity).
- **Patient History:** Includes past medical/surgical history, family history, social history, and current medications.
- **Objective (O):** Records measurable and factual data collected by the provider.
- **Vital Signs:** Height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature.
- **Physical Exam:** Findings from visual inspection, palpation, and auscultation (e.g., "tenderness in abdomen").
- **Diagnostic Data:** Results from labs, X-rays, or psychological tests (e.g., PHQ-9 scores).
- **Assessment (A):** The clinician’s professional synthesis and analysis.
- **Diagnosis:** The primary condition identified, often including a "differential diagnosis" (a list of other possibilities ranked by likelihood).
- **Progress:** An evaluation of how the patient is responding to current treatments.
- **Plan (P):** Outlines future steps for management and treatment.
- **Interventions:** Prescribed medications, therapies, or home exercise programs.
- **Follow-up:** Scheduled next visits, referrals to specialists, and patient education. 

Benefits and Best Practices:
- **Standardization:** Provides a consistent format that reduces confusion when multiple providers treat the same patient.
- **Legal & Billing Support:** Serves as a vital legal record and provides the necessary justification for insurance claims.
- **Clarity:** Use concise, direct language and avoid personal opinions or "judging" the patient (e.g., use "patient reports 8/10 pain" instead of "patient is overreacting").
- **APSO Variant:** In some settings, providers use the APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective) order to place the most critical decision-making information at the very top for faster review.
