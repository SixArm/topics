  <p>Say, Think, Do, Feel</p>
  <p>The empathy map framework divides user understanding into four quadrants: Say (user's spoken statements and quotes), Think (internal thoughts and beliefs), Do (observable behaviors and actions), and Feel (emotions and feelings). This structure helps designers systematically capture different aspects of the user experience to build deeper empathy and create more user-centered solutions.</p>
