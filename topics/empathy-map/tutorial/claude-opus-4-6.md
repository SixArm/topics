# Empathy map

An empathy map is a collaborative visualization tool used in User Experience (UX) design, product management, and human-centered innovation to build a deeper understanding of users. Originally developed by Dave Gray of XPLANE, the empathy map helps cross-functional teams move beyond demographic profiles and abstract personas by synthesizing what a specific user or user segment says, thinks, does, and feels. By externalizing these dimensions onto a shared canvas, teams align around a common picture of the user's lived experience, which drives better design decisions, sharper product requirements, and more resonant communication strategies.

## Why Empathy Maps Matter

Technology professionals frequently operate under assumptions about users that go untested. Engineers optimize for technical elegance, product managers optimize for business metrics, and designers optimize for aesthetics, yet none of these priorities necessarily reflect what the user actually needs. Empathy maps close that gap by forcing every team member to ground their work in observed user behavior and expressed sentiment.

The benefits are tangible:

- **Reduced rework**: Decisions rooted in genuine user understanding are less likely to be reversed after usability testing.
- **Shared vocabulary**: A visible empathy map on a wall or digital whiteboard gives distributed teams a single reference point for user context.
- **Faster onboarding**: New team members can absorb the user perspective quickly by reviewing the map instead of reading lengthy research reports.
- **Bias surfacing**: The act of filling in the quadrants often reveals where a team has strong data versus where it is guessing, highlighting gaps that research should address.

## The Four Quadrants

The classic empathy map is divided into four quadrants, each capturing a distinct facet of the user's experience. The quadrants work together; no single one is sufficient on its own.

| Quadrant | Core Question | What to Capture | Typical Sources |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Say** | What does the user literally state? | Direct quotes, feedback verbatim, survey responses, support tickets | Interviews, usability tests, call transcripts |
| **Think** | What occupies the user's mind? | Beliefs, assumptions, worries, aspirations they may not voice aloud | Contextual inquiry, diary studies, think-aloud protocols |
| **Do** | What actions does the user take? | Observable behaviors, workflows, workarounds, frequency of actions | Analytics, session recordings, field observation |
| **Feel** | What emotions does the user experience? | Frustrations, delights, anxieties, motivations, confidence levels | Tone of voice in interviews, facial expressions, sentiment analysis |

**Say** captures explicit, quotable language. These are the statements a user would write in a survey or speak during an interview. They are valuable because they are unambiguous, but they can also be misleading when users say what they think the interviewer wants to hear.

**Think** goes beneath the surface. Users often hold beliefs or assumptions they do not articulate. For example, a user may never say "I don't trust this checkout page," but their hesitation and repeated checking of the URL bar reveals that thought. Capturing this quadrant requires inference grounded in evidence.

**Do** records observable actions. This is the most objective quadrant because behavior can be measured. Tracking what users actually do, rather than what they claim to do, often reveals the most actionable insights for technology teams.

**Feel** addresses the emotional dimension. Emotions drive decision-making more than most technology professionals assume. A user who feels anxious about data privacy will behave differently from one who feels confident, even if both have the same technical literacy.

## Extended Empathy Map Variants

Dave Gray later revised the empathy map canvas to include additional sections that sharpen its utility. Many teams now work with a six-section model.

- **Goal**: What is the user trying to achieve? Defining the goal up front ensures the map stays focused on a specific scenario rather than drifting into generalities.
- **Say and Do**: Some variants merge these into a single section because spoken statements and visible actions are both externally observable.
- **Think and Feel**: Similarly, thoughts and emotions are both internal states and are sometimes combined.
- **Pains**: What frustrations, obstacles, or fears does the user encounter? This section makes friction explicit.
- **Gains**: What does success look like for the user? What would exceed their expectations? This section captures desired outcomes.

The choice between the four-quadrant and six-section model depends on context. The four-quadrant version is faster for workshops and sufficient for early-stage exploration. The six-section version is better for detailed persona development and when the team needs to connect empathy directly to value proposition design.

## How to Facilitate an Empathy Mapping Session

A productive empathy mapping session follows a structured sequence.

1. **Define scope**: Select a specific user segment and a specific scenario. An empathy map for "all users of our platform" is too broad to be useful. An empathy map for "a first-time enterprise administrator configuring single sign-on" is actionable.
2. **Gather inputs**: Bring real data into the room. This includes interview transcripts, analytics dashboards, support ticket summaries, and usability test recordings. An empathy map built on opinion alone is just a guess with sticky notes.
3. **Individual brainstorm**: Give each participant five to ten minutes to write observations on sticky notes, one observation per note, categorized by quadrant.
4. **Place and cluster**: Participants place their notes on the map. The facilitator leads a discussion to cluster related notes and resolve contradictions.
5. **Identify patterns**: Look for themes that cut across quadrants. A user who says "I just want it to work," thinks "this is too complicated," does "calls support instead of reading documentation," and feels "frustrated and embarrassed" tells a coherent story about complexity being the core problem.
6. **Prioritize insights**: Not every observation is equally important. Mark the insights that are most surprising, most actionable, or most strongly supported by evidence.
7. **Connect to action**: An empathy map that stays on the wall and never influences a decision is waste. Translate insights into design requirements, backlog items, or research questions.

## Common Mistakes

- **Filling it in without data**: The most frequent failure mode. Teams treat the empathy map as a creative exercise rather than a synthesis tool. Without real user input, the map reflects the team's biases, not the user's reality.
- **One map for all users**: Different user segments have different mental models, behaviors, and emotional responses. A single map conflating a power user with a novice will be useless to both.
- **Treating it as a one-time artifact**: User understanding evolves. Empathy maps should be revisited as new research arrives, especially after major product changes or shifts in the user base.
- **Ignoring the Think and Feel quadrants**: Technology teams often gravitate toward Say and Do because those are more concrete. Skipping the internal quadrants forfeits the deeper insight that makes empathy maps valuable.

## Empathy Maps Compared to Other UX Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Depth | Best For |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Empathy Map** | Synthesize user mindset and behavior | Moderate | Aligning a team around a single user perspective quickly |
| **Persona** | Define a representative user archetype | High | Long-term reference across multiple projects |
| **Customer Journey Map** | Visualize the end-to-end experience over time | High | Identifying pain points across touchpoints and stages |
| **Jobs-to-Be-Done** | Articulate the outcome the user is hiring a product to achieve | Moderate | Framing product strategy around user goals |
| **Stakeholder Map** | Identify and prioritize people affected by a project | Low to Moderate | Managing relationships and communication plans |

Empathy maps are lighter-weight than journey maps or full personas, which makes them ideal for workshops and sprint planning. They are not a replacement for deeper research artifacts but serve as a fast, shared synthesis format that keeps the user visible during day-to-day decision-making.

## Related

Teams that use empathy maps effectively typically invest in adjacent practices. **Personas** extend the empathy map into a reusable archetype with demographic and behavioral detail. **Customer journey maps** add a temporal dimension, showing how the user's thoughts and feelings change across stages. **User interviews** and **contextual inquiry** provide the raw data that makes empathy maps credible. **Jobs-to-Be-Done** frameworks connect user empathy to product strategy by focusing on the outcome the user seeks. **Design thinking** provides the broader methodology in which empathy maps sit as a foundational step. **Card sorting** and **usability testing** are complementary research methods that generate inputs for the map. **Value proposition design** uses pains and gains directly, making the six-section empathy map a natural feeder artifact.

## Summary

An empathy map is a structured, visual tool that synthesizes what a user says, thinks, does, and feels into a shared team artifact. It transforms scattered research data into a coherent picture of the user's experience, enabling technology professionals to design products and services grounded in genuine understanding rather than assumption. When populated with real data, facilitated with discipline, and connected to actionable outcomes, the empathy map is one of the most efficient ways to keep user needs at the center of product development.
