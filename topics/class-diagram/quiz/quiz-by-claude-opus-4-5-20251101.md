# Class diagram

Question: In a class diagram, what is the primary purpose of showing relationships such as association, aggregation, and composition between classes?

- [ ] To define the programming language syntax for implementing the classes
- [ ] To represent the connections and dependencies between classes in a system
- [ ] To specify the runtime performance characteristics of each class
- [ ] To document the version history and changelog of each class

  <p>To represent the connections and dependencies between classes in a system</p>
  <p>Relationships in a class diagram show how classes are connected to each other. Association indicates a general connection (e.g., "has a"), aggregation represents a whole-part relationship where parts can exist independently, and composition represents a stronger whole-part relationship where parts cannot exist without the whole. These relationships are fundamental to understanding the structure and design of an object-oriented system.</p>
