# Agile without backlogs

Question: What is the primary way that teams operating without backlogs determine what work to do next?

- [ ] They follow a predetermined project schedule created at the start of the project
- [ ] They work through a prioritized queue of features maintained by the product owner
- [ ] They use a pull-based system with continuous discovery through direct stakeholder collaboration and real-time feedback
- [ ] They rely on management to assign tasks based on quarterly planning cycles

  <p>They use a pull-based system with continuous discovery through direct stakeholder collaboration and real-time feedback</p>
  <p>In backlog-free agile, work emerges organically from direct stakeholder collaboration rather than being drawn from a pre-planned queue. Teams engage in continuous discovery sessions with users and stakeholders to identify the most pressing needs at any given moment, eliminating the overhead of maintaining extensive work queues and reducing waste associated with outdated backlog items.</p>
