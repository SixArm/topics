# Agile without backlogs

Agile software engineering traditionally relies heavily on product backlogs to manage requirements and prioritize work, but some teams are exploring backlog-free approaches that emphasize even greater flexibility and responsiveness. This radical interpretation of agile principles focuses on immediate value delivery without the overhead of maintaining extensive work queues.

In backlog-free agile, teams operate on a pull-based system where work emerges organically from direct stakeholder collaboration and real-time feedback. Instead of pre-planning features in a backlog, development teams engage in continuous discovery sessions with users and stakeholders to identify the most pressing needs at any given moment. This approach eliminates the waste associated with maintaining outdated backlog items and reduces the cognitive load of prioritization ceremonies.

The methodology requires exceptionally strong communication channels and mature self-organizing teams capable of making rapid decisions about what to build next. Teams must excel at breaking down problems into small, deliverable increments that can be completed within hours or days rather than weeks. Technical practices like continuous integration, automated testing, and feature flags become even more critical to support this level of agility.

This approach can lead to highly responsive software development that closely aligns with user needs. Success with backlog-free agile requires exceptional discipline, technical excellence, and organizational support for experimentation. Teams must be comfortable with uncertainty and possess strong collaborative skills to navigate the inherent ambiguity of this approach.
