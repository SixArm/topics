# Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)

The Value Set Authority Center (VSAC) is a repository and authoring tool for
public value sets created by external programs. Value sets are lists of codes
and corresponding terms, from NLM-hosted standard clinical vocabularies (such as
SNOMED CT®, RxNorm, LOINC® and others), that define clinical concepts to support
effective and interoperable health information exchange. 

The VSAC does not create value set content. 

The VSAC also provides downloadable access to all official versions of value
sets specified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) electronic
Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs). For information on CMS eCQMs, visit the eCQI
Resource Center. The VSAC is provided by the National Library of Medicine (NLM),
in collaboration with the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy/Office of
the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ASTP) and CMS.
