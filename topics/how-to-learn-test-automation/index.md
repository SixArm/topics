# How to learn test automation?

Start by learning a programming language commonly used in automation. JavaScript is often recommended for beginners due to its readable syntax and extensive automation libraries. Focus on understanding basic programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

Next, familiarize yourself with testing frameworks specific to your chosen language. Popular options include Selenium for web application testing, PyTest or unittest for Python, TestNG or JUnit for Java, and Jest or Mocha for JavaScript. These frameworks provide the structure and tools needed to write, organize, and execute automated tests effectively.

Gain hands-on experience by practicing on real applications or demo websites. Start with simple test cases like form submissions, login functionality, or navigation testing. Gradually progress to more complex scenarios involving data-driven testing, API testing, and cross-browser compatibility. Version control systems like Git are essential for managing your test code and collaborating with teams.

Consider pursuing relevant certifications or online courses from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or specialized testing education providers. These structured learning paths often include practical projects and industry best practices. Join testing communities and forums where you can ask questions, share experiences, and learn from experienced professionals.

Finally, understand the broader context of software testing methodologies, including test design techniques and continuous integration practices. This will help you write more effective automated tests and integrate them into development workflows.
