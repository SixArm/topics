  <p>Cache invalidation and naming things</p>
  <p>Phil Karlton, a computer scientist who worked at Netscape, famously stated: "There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things." Cache invalidation is challenging because ensuring cached data remains consistent with the underlying data source is complex, especially in distributed systems. Naming things is difficult because choosing meaningful, clear, and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes requires careful thought and significantly impacts code readability and maintainability.</p>
