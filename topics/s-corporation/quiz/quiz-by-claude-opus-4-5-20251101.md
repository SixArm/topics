  <p>S-Corps allow pass-through taxation, avoiding double taxation at the corporate level</p>
  <p>An S-Corporation's income and losses pass through directly to shareholders, who report these amounts on their individual tax returns. This means the company itself is not taxed on its profits at the corporate level, unlike a traditional C-Corporation where profits are taxed at the corporate level and again when distributed as dividends to shareholders.</p>
