# Case-based reasoning (CBR)

Question: What are the four stages of the case-based reasoning (CBR) problem-solving cycle?

- [ ] Analyze, Design, Implement, Test
- [ ] Retrieve, Reuse, Revise, Retain
- [ ] Gather, Process, Output, Store
- [ ] Identify, Compare, Select, Apply

  <p>Retrieve, Reuse, Revise, Retain</p>
  <p>CBR follows a four-stage cycle: Retrieve (find similar previously solved cases), Reuse (adapt the retrieved solution to fit the current problem), Revise (evaluate and refine the solution if necessary), and Retain (add the new problem and solution to the case base for future use). This cycle enables the system to learn and improve over time.</p>
