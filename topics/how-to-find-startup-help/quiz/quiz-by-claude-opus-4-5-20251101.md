  <p>Hiring a dedicated in-house legal team before launching</p>
  <p>The common resources for finding startup help include incubators and accelerators, networking events, online communities, government programs, crowdfunding platforms, business incubation centers, co-working spaces, and social media. Hiring a dedicated in-house legal team is not listed as a typical way to find startup help—early-stage startups typically seek external resources, mentorship, and community connections rather than building internal legal departments before launch.</p>
