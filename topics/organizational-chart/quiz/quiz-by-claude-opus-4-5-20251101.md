  <p>A matrix org chart shows cross-functional relationships without a clear chain of command, while a hierarchical org chart shows a clear reporting structure</p>
  <p>A hierarchical org chart is the most common type and displays a clear chain of command where each level of management and staff reports to the level above them. A matrix org chart, in contrast, shows relationships between employees who work on different projects or in different departments and may not have a clear chain of command, making it suitable for organizations with cross-functional teams.</p>
