  <p>To ensure AI behavior and decision-making are consistent with human values, goals, and intentions</p>
  <p>AI alignment (also called value alignment or goal alignment) focuses on ensuring that AI systems behave in ways that are consistent with human values, goals, and intentions. This becomes increasingly critical as AI systems become more autonomous and capable, to prevent scenarios where AI takes actions that are harmful or contrary to what humans actually want—even if the AI believes it is acting correctly.</p>
