  <p>Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, Create</p>
  <p>The Blue Ocean Strategy framework uses four actions: Eliminate factors no longer needed, Reduce factors below industry standard, Raise factors above industry standard, and Create factors the industry has never offered. This four-action framework helps companies break out of competitive "red oceans" and create new, uncontested market space where competition becomes irrelevant.</p>
