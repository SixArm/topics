  <p>RDF (Resource Description Framework)</p>
  <p>SPARQL is a query language specifically designed to retrieve and manipulate data stored in RDF format. While SQL is designed for relational databases, SPARQL was created specifically for querying RDF data, which is a standard format used for representing and exchanging data on the Web. This makes SPARQL essential for working with semantic web technologies, knowledge graphs, and linked data applications.</p>
