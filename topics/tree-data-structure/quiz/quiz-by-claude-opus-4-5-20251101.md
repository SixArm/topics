# Tree data structure

Question: What is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes a tree data structure from other hierarchical structures?

- [ ] Each node can have multiple parent nodes
- [ ] All nodes must have exactly two children
- [ ] Each node has exactly one parent (except the root) and zero or more children
- [ ] Nodes are connected in a circular pattern

  <p>Each node has exactly one parent (except the root) and zero or more children</p>
  <p>This is the defining property of a tree data structure. The root node sits at the top with no parent, while all other nodes have exactly one parent and can have any number of children. This single-parent rule creates the hierarchical, branching structure that makes trees useful for representing relationships like file systems, organizational charts, and family trees, and enables efficient algorithms for searching, insertion, and traversal.</p>
