# Purpose + measures + method

"Purpose + measures + method" emphasizes alignment between organizational objectives, success metrics, and implementation approaches. This methodology ensures that every change initiative begins with a clear understanding of why the change is necessary, establishing specific criteria for measuring success, and then determining the most appropriate methods to achieve desired outcomes.

**Purpose** is the fundamental reason for an organization's existence, outlining its core values and desired impact. Examples: Creating value for customers, solving a societal problem, or fostering innovation. Importance: A clear purpose provides direction, motivates employees, and guides decision-making.

**Measures** are the indicators used to track progress towards achieving the purpose. They should be aligned with the purpose and reflect what truly matters. Examples: Measures can be quantitative (e.g., sales figures, customer satisfaction scores) or qualitative (e.g., employee engagement, brand perception). Importance: Measures provide feedback, identify areas for improvement, and help ensure that efforts are focused on the right outcomes.

**Method** encompasses the specific actions, processes, and strategies used to achieve the organization's purpose and meet its goals. Examples: Developing new products, implementing marketing campaigns, or streamlining workflows. Importance: The method should be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances, allowing for continuous improvement and innovation.

In agile software engineering contexts, "purpose + measures + method" drives iterative development by first defining the business value or user need that justifies each feature or enhancement. Teams establish quantifiable metrics such as user engagement rates, performance improvements, or defect reduction targets before selecting technical approaches. This prevents the common pitfall of implementing solutions without clear success criteria or business justification.

By maintaining focus on purpose throughout the change process, organizations achieve better alignment between technical delivery and business objectives, resulting in more successful software implementations and sustainable organizational transformation.
