# Purpose + measures + method

"Purpose + measures + method" emphasizes alignment between organizational objectives, key performance metrics, and implementation approaches.

**Purpose** is the fundamental reason for an organization's existence, outlining its core values and desired impact. Examples: Creating value for customers, solving a societal problem, or fostering innovation. Importance: A clear purpose provides direction, motivates employees, and guides decision-making.

**Measures** are the indicators used to track progress towards achieving the purpose. They should be aligned with the purpose and reflect what truly matters.  Examples: Measures can be quantitative (e.g., sales figures, customer satisfaction scores) or qualitative (e.g., employee engagement, brand perception). Importance: Measures provide feedback, identify areas for improvement, and help ensure that efforts are focused on the right outcomes. 

**Method** encompasses the specific actions, processes, and strategies used to achieve the organization's purpose and meet its goals. Examples: Developing new products, implementing marketing campaigns, or streamlining workflows. Importance: The method should be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances, allowing for continuous improvement and innovation. 

In agile software engineering contexts, "purpose + measures + method" drives iterative development by first defining the business value or user need that justifies each feature or enhancement. Teams establish quantifiable metrics such as user engagement rates, performance improvements, or defect reduction targets. Then teams select technical approaches. The impact is organizations achieve better alignment between objectives and results.
