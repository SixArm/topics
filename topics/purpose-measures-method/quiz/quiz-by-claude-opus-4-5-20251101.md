# Purpose + measures + method

Question: In the "purpose + measures + method" framework, what is the correct sequence and relationship between the three elements?

  <p>Purpose provides direction, measures track progress, and method defines the implementation approach</p>
  <p>The framework emphasizes alignment between organizational objectives (purpose), key performance metrics (measures), and implementation approaches (method). Purpose is the fundamental reason for existence that guides decision-making, measures are indicators that track progress toward achieving that purpose, and method encompasses the specific actions and strategies used to achieve the purpose and meet goals. In agile contexts, this sequence drives iterative development by first defining business value, then establishing quantifiable metrics, and finally selecting technical approaches.</p>
