  <p>The seller, since the price is predetermined</p>
  <p>In a fixed-price contract, the seller agrees to deliver a product or service at a predetermined price regardless of actual costs incurred. This means the seller assumes all risks associated with cost increases, delays, and other unforeseen expenses, while the buyer gains cost certainty for budgeting purposes.</p>
