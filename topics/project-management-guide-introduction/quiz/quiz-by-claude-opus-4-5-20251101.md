  <p>It creates shared context and clearer communication, accelerating team collaboration</p>
  <p>The guide emphasizes that shared glossaries help create "shared context and clearer communication" which can "accelerate working together" and help teams "forge better project plans." This is especially valuable for cross-cultural teams where members may come from different countries, industries, or ways of working, and may not be familiar with common project management terminology, quotations, aphorisms, and idioms.</p>
