  <p>A line with crow's feet on both ends</p>
  <p>In ERD notation, a many-to-many relationship indicates that each instance of one entity can be related to many instances of another entity, and vice versa. For example, students and courses have a many-to-many relationship because each student can take many courses, and each course can have many students. The crow's feet symbol on both ends visually represents the "many" side of the relationship at each entity.</p>
