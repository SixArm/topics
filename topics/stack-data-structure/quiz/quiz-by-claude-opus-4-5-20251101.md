# Stack data structure

Question: What principle does a stack data structure follow for adding and removing elements?

- [ ] Random Access Memory (RAM)
- [ ] Priority-Based Ordering (PBO)

  <p>Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)</p>
  <p>A stack follows the LIFO principle, meaning the element most recently added (pushed) to the stack is the first one to be removed (popped). This is analogous to a physical stack of plates where you add and remove plates from the top.</p>
