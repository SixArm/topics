  <p>Human psychological vulnerabilities such as trust, fear, and curiosity</p>
  <p>Social engineering is fundamentally a psychological attack that manipulates people rather than exploiting technical flaws. Attackers leverage human traits like trust, fear, greed, and curiosity to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or taking actions they normally wouldn't. This distinguishes social engineering from technical attacks that target software or hardware weaknesses.</p>
