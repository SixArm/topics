  <p>Use AI to handle routine tasks while preserving human collaboration, judgment, and creativity</p>
  <p>Successful AI integration in agile environments requires balancing automation with human oversight. AI tools can augment human capabilities by handling routine tasks such as bug detection, test case generation, and predictive analytics. However, they cannot replace the collaborative spirit and human judgment that are central to agile methodologies. The key is leveraging AI to free developers to focus on innovation, problem-solving, and delivering value to customers, while maintaining the communication and creativity essential to agile frameworks.</p>
