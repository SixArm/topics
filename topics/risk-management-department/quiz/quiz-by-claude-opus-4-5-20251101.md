  <p>To identify, assess, and mitigate risks that may affect the organization's ability to achieve its objectives</p>
  <p>The risk management department's core mission is to systematically identify potential risks (financial, operational, legal, regulatory, reputational), assess their probability and impact, and develop strategies to mitigate or manage them. This includes compliance oversight, insurance management, crisis planning, and employee training—all aimed at protecting the organization's ability to achieve its goals, not eliminating all risk entirely.</p>
