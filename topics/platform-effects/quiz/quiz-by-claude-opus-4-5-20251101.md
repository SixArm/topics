  <p>The platform effect includes value created by third-party developers who build complementary products and services on the platform</p>
  <p>While network effects describe how a product becomes more valuable as more people use it, the platform effect goes further by including the value generated by third-party developers who create complementary products and services. This creates entire ecosystems—like Apple's App Store or Amazon's Marketplace—where the platform's value comes not just from users, but from the contributions of developers building on top of it.</p>
