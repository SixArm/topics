# Vector database

Question: What technique do approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) vector databases use to speed up similarity search?

- [ ] SQL joins and foreign key relationships
- [ ] Row-based indexing with B-trees
- [ ] Locality-sensitive hashing and tree-based indexing
- [ ] Column-oriented compression algorithms

  <p>Locality-sensitive hashing and tree-based indexing</p>
  <p>Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) databases use techniques such as locality-sensitive hashing and tree-based indexing to identify candidate vectors that are likely to be similar to the query vector. This enables fast and accurate similarity search even for very large datasets, which is essential for applications like recommendation systems and image search engines.</p>
