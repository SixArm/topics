  <p>Spear phishing is highly targeted and tailored to specific individuals using researched information</p>
  <p>Unlike traditional phishing attacks that are mass-mailed to many recipients, spear phishing attacks are specifically crafted for individual targets. Attackers conduct extensive research on their victims using publicly available information from social media, company websites, and other sources to create convincing messages that appear legitimate, making these attacks more difficult to detect.</p>
