  <p>To outline the company's ownership structure and detail all issued equity and securities</p>
  <p>A capitalization table is a critical document that provides a comprehensive view of a company's capitalization and ownership structure. It includes information on all types of securities issued (common stock, preferred stock, options, warrants, convertible notes), the number of outstanding shares, vesting status, and the ownership percentage of each shareholder or investor. This transparency helps founders understand dilution, determine company valuation, negotiate with investors, and attract potential acquirers.</p>
