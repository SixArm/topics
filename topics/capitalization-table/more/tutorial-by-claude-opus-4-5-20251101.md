## Capitalization Table

A capitalization table, commonly called a "cap table," is a foundational document that records the complete ownership structure of a company. It details all equity securities issued by the company and shows exactly who owns what percentage of the business. For technology professionals—whether founders, employees with equity compensation, or those working with startups—understanding cap tables is essential for making informed career and financial decisions.

## What a Cap Table Contains

A cap table tracks several critical data points about company ownership:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Shareholder names** | All individuals and entities holding equity |
| **Security types** | Common stock, preferred stock, options, warrants, convertible notes |
| **Share counts** | Number of shares held by each party |
| **Ownership percentages** | Each holder's stake relative to total shares |
| **Vesting schedules** | Whether shares are fully vested or subject to time-based release |
| **Share prices** | Purchase price or strike price for each security class |
| **Investment amounts** | Capital contributed by each investor |

## Types of Securities on a Cap Table

Cap tables track multiple security types, each with different rights and characteristics:

- **Common stock**: The basic equity held by founders and employees. Carries voting rights but sits last in liquidation preference.
- **Preferred stock**: Typically held by investors. Includes special rights like liquidation preferences, anti-dilution protection, and sometimes board seats.
- **Stock options**: The right to purchase shares at a predetermined strike price. Standard in employee compensation packages.
- **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**: Promises to grant shares upon meeting certain conditions, usually time-based vesting.
- **Warrants**: Similar to options but typically issued to investors or lenders rather than employees.
- **Convertible notes**: Debt instruments that convert to equity at a future financing round, often with a discount or valuation cap.
- **SAFEs**: Simple Agreements for Future Equity—similar to convertible notes but without the debt component.

## Why Cap Tables Matter

### For Founders and Executives

Cap tables reveal the true cost of fundraising. Each financing round dilutes existing shareholders, and founders must understand how future rounds will affect their ownership stake. A clear cap table enables:

- Accurate dilution modeling for future funding scenarios
- Informed negotiation with investors on valuation and terms
- Strategic decisions about when and how much capital to raise

### For Employees with Equity

Technology professionals receiving equity compensation should understand:

- Their ownership percentage on a fully-diluted basis (including all outstanding options and convertible securities)
- How future funding rounds will dilute their stake
- The difference between their option strike price and current fair market value
- Vesting schedules and cliff periods affecting when they actually own their shares

### For Investors

Investors use cap tables to:

- Calculate potential returns under various exit scenarios
- Understand their liquidation preferences and rights
- Track ownership across portfolio companies
- Model the impact of future financing rounds

## Fully-Diluted vs. Outstanding Shares

A critical distinction exists between two ways of calculating ownership:

| Calculation Method | What It Includes | When to Use |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Outstanding shares** | Only shares currently issued and held | Legal voting calculations |
| **Fully-diluted shares** | All outstanding shares plus all options, warrants, and convertible securities as if exercised | Evaluating true ownership percentages |

When assessing equity compensation, always calculate your ownership on a fully-diluted basis. The outstanding share count understates total potential dilution.

## Common Cap Table Scenarios

### Founding Stage

At incorporation, the cap table is simple: founders hold common stock, often with a four-year vesting schedule. An option pool (typically 10-20% of shares) is reserved for future employee grants.

### Seed Round

Early investors receive preferred stock with basic protections. The option pool may expand. Founders and early employees see their first dilution event.

### Series A and Beyond

Each subsequent round introduces new preferred share classes with potentially different rights. Dilution compounds, and the cap table grows more complex with multiple investor tiers and varying liquidation preferences.

## Cap Table Management Best Practices

- **Maintain accuracy**: Even small errors compound over time and create legal complications
- **Use proper software**: Spreadsheets work early on, but dedicated cap table management tools (Carta, Pulley, Shareworks) become essential as complexity grows
- **Model scenarios**: Run dilution models before each financing round
- **Track vesting**: Monitor option vesting schedules and exercise windows
- **Document everything**: Keep records of all equity grants, transfers, and modifications

## Key Metrics Derived from Cap Tables

| Metric | Calculation | Significance |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Ownership percentage** | Shares held ÷ Total fully-diluted shares | Your stake in the company |
| **Post-money valuation** | Investment amount ÷ Investor ownership percentage | Company value after investment |
| **Option pool shuffle** | Impact of option pool on pre-money valuation | Affects true dilution to existing shareholders |
| **Liquidation preference multiple** | Total preferred payouts before common | What investors receive first in an exit |

## Red Flags to Watch

When reviewing a cap table—whether as a potential employee or investor—watch for these warning signs:

- **Excessive founder dilution**: If founders own very little before profitability, motivation may suffer
- **Large option pool without clear hiring plans**: May indicate future dilution for employees
- **Stacked liquidation preferences**: Multiple rounds with 2x or higher preferences can eliminate common shareholder returns
- **Unusual share structures**: Excessive complexity often benefits insiders at the expense of employees and later investors
- **Missing or outdated records**: Suggests poor corporate governance

## Cap Table and Exit Scenarios

Understanding how cap tables affect exit outcomes is crucial. In an acquisition or IPO:

1. **Debt and obligations** are paid first
2. **Liquidation preferences** go to preferred shareholders (often 1x their investment, sometimes more)
3. **Participation rights** may allow preferred holders to also share in remaining proceeds
4. **Common shareholders** (founders, employees) receive what remains

This waterfall structure means that in modest exits, common shareholders may receive little or nothing despite holding significant ownership percentages on paper.

## Summary

A capitalization table is far more than an administrative record—it's a strategic tool that determines who benefits from a company's success. Technology professionals should understand cap tables to evaluate job offers with equity components, make informed investment decisions, and navigate the complex ownership structures common in startups. Accurate cap table management and clear understanding of dilution mechanics separate informed participants from those who discover the true value of their equity only at exit.
