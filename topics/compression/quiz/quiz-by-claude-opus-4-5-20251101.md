# Compression

Question: What is the fundamental difference between lossless and lossy compression?

- [ ] Lossless compression is faster but produces larger files than lossy compression
- [ ] Lossy compression can only be used for text files, while lossless works for all file types
- [ ] Lossless compression preserves all original data, while lossy compression permanently discards some data to achieve smaller file sizes
- [ ] Lossless compression uses dictionary-based methods, while lossy compression uses statistical modeling

  <p>Lossless compression preserves all original data, while lossy compression permanently discards some data to achieve smaller file sizes</p>
  <p>Lossless compression allows the compressed data to be fully restored to its original form with no information lost. This is essential for data where accuracy is critical, such as text documents or executable files. Lossy compression, used in formats like JPEG for images and MP3 for audio, sacrifices some data quality to achieve significantly smaller file sizes—acceptable when minor quality loss is tolerable.</p>
