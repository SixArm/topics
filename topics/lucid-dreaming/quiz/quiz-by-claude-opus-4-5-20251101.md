  <p>Reality testing</p>
  <p>Reality testing involves regularly questioning reality during waking hours (such as checking if text changes when you look away, or trying to push a finger through your palm). This habit carries over into dreams, where reality behaves differently, leading the dreamer to recognize they are in a dream state. This is one of the most practical and widely-used techniques for inducing lucid dreams.</p>
