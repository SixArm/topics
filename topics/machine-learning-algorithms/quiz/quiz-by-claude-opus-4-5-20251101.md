  <p>Reinforcement Learning</p>
  <p>Reinforcement Learning algorithms learn through trial and error by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards for beneficial actions and penalties for detrimental ones. This feedback loop enables the algorithm to develop an optimal policy—a strategy for selecting actions that maximizes cumulative rewards over time. This approach is distinct from supervised learning (which requires labeled data) and unsupervised learning (which discovers patterns in unlabeled data without explicit feedback).</p>
