# Agile manifesto 1: Individuals and interactions

"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"

This concept recognizes that software engineering is fundamentally a human endeavor, where the quality of communication, collaboration, and relationships between team members directly impacts project success.

Traditional software development approaches often prioritized rigid processes, extensive documentation, and sophisticated toolsets, sometimes at the expense of human connection and adaptability. While these elements remain important, the Agile philosophy argues that they should serve people rather than constrain them. Teams that focus on building strong interpersonal relationships, fostering open communication, and encouraging face-to-face interactions typically deliver better results than those that rely solely on formal procedures.

Software development is inherently creative and problem-solving work that requires flexibility, quick decision-making, and the ability to respond to changing requirements. When team members can communicate effectively, share knowledge freely, and collaborate seamlessly, they can adapt more readily to challenges and opportunities that arise during development.

The emphasis on individuals and interactions doesn't dismiss the value of processes and tools entirely. Rather, it suggests that these should be lightweight, supportive, and designed to enhance human collaboration rather than replace it. Effective Agile teams use processes as guidelines rather than rigid rules, and select tools that facilitate communication and collaboration rather than create barriers.
