  <p>Enhance human collaboration rather than constrain it</p>
  <p>The Agile Manifesto values "individuals and interactions over processes and tools." This doesn't dismiss processes and tools entirely, but emphasizes they should be lightweight, supportive, and designed to enhance human collaboration rather than replace or constrain it. Effective Agile teams use processes as guidelines rather than rigid rules, and select tools that facilitate communication and collaboration.</p>
