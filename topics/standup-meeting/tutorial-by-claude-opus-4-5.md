## Standup Meeting

A standup meeting, also known as a daily scrum, is a brief synchronization ritual where team members share progress, plans, and blockers. Participants typically stand during the meeting to promote brevity and focus. This practice originated in agile software development but has since spread across technology organizations regardless of methodology.

## The Three Questions

The standup meeting follows a structured format where each team member answers three questions:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What did you work on yesterday? | Provides visibility into completed work and progress |
| What are you planning to work on today? | Communicates priorities and helps identify dependencies |
| What obstacles are preventing progress? | Surfaces blockers early so the team can address them |

Each person should take no more than one to two minutes to answer these questions. The meeting is not a status report to management but a peer-to-peer synchronization tool.

## Key Principles

- **Timeboxed**: Standups should last 15 minutes or less for a typical team
- **Same time, same place**: Consistency reduces coordination overhead
- **Standing encouraged**: Physical discomfort discourages rambling
- **Focused on the work**: Discussions of solutions happen after the meeting
- **Everyone participates**: Each team member shares their update

## Benefits for Technology Teams

Standup meetings provide several advantages:

- **Early blocker detection**: Problems surface before they cascade into larger delays
- **Improved collaboration**: Team members learn who is working on related tasks and can offer help
- **Reduced email and meetings**: Quick daily sync reduces the need for ad-hoc interruptions
- **Team alignment**: Everyone stays informed about project direction and priorities
- **Accountability**: Public commitments encourage follow-through

## Common Antipatterns to Avoid

| Antipattern | Problem | Solution |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Status reporting to manager | Kills peer collaboration | Speak to the team, not leadership |
| Problem-solving during standup | Extends meeting beyond usefulness | Take discussions offline |
| Going over time | Erodes team buy-in | Enforce the timebox strictly |
| Sitting down | Meetings expand to fill available comfort | Stand or use another constraint |
| Skipping blockers | Critical issues go unaddressed | Explicitly ask about obstacles |
| Too many attendees | Standups become unwieldy | Limit to core team members |

## Remote and Distributed Teams

For teams working across time zones or remotely, standup meetings require adaptation:

- **Asynchronous standups**: Team members post their updates in a shared channel (Slack, Teams) at the start of their workday
- **Rotating times**: Alternate meeting times so the burden of inconvenient hours is shared
- **Video on**: Cameras help maintain engagement and connection
- **Dedicated tooling**: Tools like Geekbot, Status Hero, or Range automate async standups

Asynchronous standups lose some spontaneity but preserve the core benefit of daily visibility into team progress.

## When Standups Work Best

Standup meetings are most effective when:

- The team is working on interdependent tasks
- Work items change frequently or have short cycle times
- The team is co-located or has overlapping working hours
- Team size is small enough for everyone to participate meaningfully (typically 5 to 10 people)

For larger teams, consider splitting into smaller groups with separate standups, then having a "scrum of scrums" for cross-team coordination.

## Ground Rules for Effective Standups

- Arrive on time and prepared
- Keep updates concise and relevant
- Listen actively when others speak
- Follow up on blockers immediately after the meeting
- Respect the timebox even when discussions are interesting
- Be honest about challenges without assigning blame

## Relationship to Agile Methodologies

The standup meeting is a core ceremony in Scrum, where it is called the daily scrum. Kanban teams also commonly use standups, often walking the board from right to left to focus on finishing work in progress. Even teams not following a formal agile framework benefit from the daily synchronization that standups provide.

The standup supports the agile values of transparency, inspection, and adaptation by making work visible and providing a regular opportunity to course-correct.
