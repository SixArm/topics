# Greylock Partners

Greylock Partners is a premier venture capital firm headquartered in Menlo Park, California, with additional offices in San Francisco and Boston. Founded in 1965, it stands as one of the longest-operating and most influential venture firms in Silicon Valley. Greylock invests primarily in early-stage enterprise and consumer technology companies, and has built a reputation for forming deep, long-term partnerships with founders rather than taking a purely transactional approach to investing.

## History and Founding

Greylock Partners was established in 1965, making it one of the earliest institutional venture capital firms in the United States. The firm predates much of the modern Silicon Valley ecosystem and has adapted through multiple technology cycles, from the rise of semiconductors and personal computing through the internet era and into the current age of cloud, mobile, and artificial intelligence. Over nearly six decades, Greylock has maintained a consistent philosophy: back exceptional founders early and support them throughout the company-building journey.

## Investment Focus

Greylock concentrates its investments in two primary sectors within the technology landscape:

- **Enterprise technology**: Infrastructure software, developer tools, cybersecurity, data analytics, and cloud platforms that serve businesses and organizations.
- **Consumer technology**: Social platforms, marketplaces, and consumer applications that achieve large-scale adoption and network effects.

The firm is known for investing at the earliest stages, often at the seed or Series A round, and then continuing to support companies through subsequent funding rounds. This approach allows Greylock to build meaningful ownership stakes and establish trust with founding teams from the outset.

## Notable Portfolio Companies

Greylock's track record includes investments in some of the most consequential technology companies of the past several decades. The following table highlights key portfolio companies and their domains:

| Company | Sector | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Facebook (Meta) | Consumer / Social Media | IPO (2012), now Meta Platforms |

| Discord | Consumer / Communications | Privately held |
| Figma | Enterprise / Design Tools | Privately held |

This portfolio demonstrates Greylock's ability to identify transformative companies across both enterprise and consumer markets well before they reach mainstream adoption.

## Value-Added Partnership Model

Greylock distinguishes itself from many venture firms through its hands-on approach to working with portfolio companies. The firm provides support across several critical dimensions:

- **Product development**: Partners with deep operating experience help founders refine product strategy, prioritize features, and navigate product-market fit.
- **Recruiting and talent**: Greylock leverages its network to help portfolio companies attract executive-level talent and key engineering hires.
- **Go-to-market strategy**: The firm advises on sales, marketing, and distribution approaches, particularly for enterprise-focused startups navigating complex sales cycles.
- **Fundraising guidance**: Portfolio companies receive support in structuring subsequent funding rounds, managing investor relations, and preparing for IPO or acquisition.
- **Network access**: Greylock's extensive relationships with Fortune 500 companies, technology leaders, and other institutional investors open doors for introductions to potential customers, partners, and acquirers.

## Key Partners and Leadership

Greylock's partnership has historically included individuals with significant operating experience at major technology companies, not just financial backgrounds. Notable current and former partners include Reid Hoffman (co-founder of LinkedIn), David Sze, Sarah Guo, and Asheem Chandna. This blend of operator and investor perspectives shapes the firm's ability to provide practical, experience-driven counsel to founders.
