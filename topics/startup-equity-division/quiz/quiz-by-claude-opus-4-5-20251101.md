  <p>Equity vesting schedules that distribute ownership over time based on tenure or milestones</p>
  <p>Vesting schedules are a critical tool in startup equity division because they distribute equity over a period of time based on predetermined criteria such as tenure or achievement of milestones. This mechanism incentivizes key people—founders, employees, and sometimes advisors—to stay with the company and contribute to its long-term success, rather than receiving all their equity upfront and potentially leaving early.</p>
