# Startup equity division

Startup equity division is the process of allocating ownership shares among the founders, employees, advisors, and investors of a new venture. It is one of the most consequential decisions a startup makes, because the equity table shapes incentive alignment, decision-making authority, and the long-term financial outcomes for everyone involved. Getting it right attracts talent and capital; getting it wrong breeds resentment and can destroy a company from within.

## Why equity division matters

Equity is the primary currency of a startup before it generates meaningful revenue. Founders exchange it for co-founder commitment, early employees accept it in lieu of market-rate salaries, advisors trade expertise for it, and investors provide capital in return for it. Because equity represents a claim on future value, how it is divided signals what the company values most and who carries the greatest risk. A well-structured equity plan keeps interests aligned through the inevitable ups and downs of building a business, while a poorly structured one creates conflicts that surface at the worst possible moments, such as during fundraising, leadership transitions, or acquisition negotiations.

## Founder equity splits

The first and often most difficult equity conversation happens among co-founders. There are two broad philosophies: equal splits and merit-based splits.

An equal split assumes that all founders contribute roughly the same value over time and that the simplicity and goodwill of an even division outweighs any differences in initial contribution. A merit-based split attempts to quantify each founder's relative contribution using factors such as who originated the idea, who built the first prototype, who is investing capital, who is working full-time versus part-time, and who brings critical domain expertise or industry connections.

| Factor | Questions to consider |
|---|---|
| Idea origination | Who conceived the core concept and validated initial demand? |
| Full-time commitment | Is every founder working on the venture full-time, or are some contributing part-time? |
| Capital contribution | Has any founder invested personal funds to get the company started? |
| Technical execution | Who is building the product, and how critical is that skill set at this stage? |
| Domain expertise | Does one founder bring rare industry knowledge, regulatory understanding, or key relationships? |
| Opportunity cost | What salary, career trajectory, or alternative ventures is each founder giving up? |

Many experienced entrepreneurs recommend having the equity conversation early, using a structured framework, and documenting the agreement in writing. Deferring the discussion often makes it harder, not easier, because perceptions of contribution diverge over time.

## Employee equity and stock options

After the founding team, employees are the next group to receive equity, typically drawn from an employee stock option pool (ESOP). A standard ESOP ranges from 10 to 20 percent of the company's total shares, set aside before or during a funding round.

Employees usually receive equity through one of the following instruments:

- **Incentive stock options (ISOs):** Tax-advantaged options available only to employees, with favorable long-term capital gains treatment if holding period requirements are met.
- **Non-qualified stock options (NSOs):** Options that can be granted to employees, contractors, and advisors, taxed as ordinary income upon exercise.
- **Restricted stock awards (RSAs):** Actual shares granted subject to vesting and, in some cases, repurchase rights. Common for very early employees who join before significant valuation increases.
- **Restricted stock units (RSUs):** Promises to deliver shares at a future date, typically upon vesting. More common at later-stage companies and public companies.

The amount of equity an individual employee receives depends on the stage of the company, the employee's seniority, the role's market salary, and how much of the compensation gap between startup pay and market pay the equity is intended to bridge.

## Vesting schedules

Vesting is the mechanism that ensures equity is earned over time rather than granted all at once. The most common vesting arrangement in startups is a four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff.

| Component | Typical terms |
|---|---|
| Total vesting period | 4 years |
| Cliff period | 1 year (no equity vests until the first anniversary) |
| Post-cliff vesting | Monthly or quarterly increments over the remaining 3 years |
| Acceleration on termination | Single-trigger or double-trigger acceleration may apply |

The cliff protects the company and other stakeholders from granting significant equity to someone who leaves after only a few months. After the cliff, equity vests incrementally so that each additional month of service is rewarded. Founders should also vest their own shares, a practice that protects all co-founders if one departs early.

Single-trigger acceleration vests some or all unvested shares upon a single event, usually a change of control such as an acquisition. Double-trigger acceleration requires two events, typically a change of control followed by involuntary termination, and is more common because it better balances employee protection with acquirer concerns.

## Advisor equity

Advisors contribute strategic guidance, introductions, and credibility in exchange for a small equity stake. The typical range is 0.25 to 1.0 percent, depending on the advisor's involvement, the stage of the company, and the value of their network or expertise.

- **Light involvement** (a few calls per quarter): 0.25 percent
- **Moderate involvement** (monthly meetings, active introductions): 0.50 percent
- **Heavy involvement** (weekly engagement, board-level participation): 0.75 to 1.0 percent

Advisor shares typically vest over one to two years, sometimes with a cliff and sometimes without, and should always be governed by a written advisor agreement.

## Investor equity and dilution

Investors receive equity in exchange for capital. The amount they receive depends on the pre-money valuation of the company and the amount invested. For example, if a company has a pre-money valuation of five million dollars and an investor contributes one million dollars, the post-money valuation is six million dollars, and the investor receives approximately 16.7 percent of the company.

Each subsequent funding round dilutes existing shareholders proportionally. Founders who start with 100 percent ownership may hold 50 to 60 percent after a seed round, 30 to 40 percent after a Series A, and 15 to 25 percent after a Series B, depending on how much capital they raise and at what valuations. Dilution is not inherently negative: a smaller percentage of a much larger pie can be worth far more in absolute terms.

Key investor equity instruments include:

- **Convertible notes:** Short-term debt that converts into equity at a future priced round, often with a discount and a valuation cap.
- **SAFEs (Simple Agreement for Future Equity):** Similar to convertible notes but without interest or a maturity date, popularized by Y Combinator.
- **Preferred stock:** The standard instrument in priced rounds, carrying rights such as liquidation preferences, anti-dilution protection, and board seats.

## Common mistakes in equity division

Startups frequently make avoidable errors when dividing equity. The most damaging include:

- **Splitting equity before defining roles and commitment levels.** An equal split on day one can become deeply unfair if one founder works 80-hour weeks while another contributes sporadically.
- **Failing to implement vesting.** Without vesting, a departing co-founder retains their full equity stake, creating a "dead equity" problem that discourages future employees and investors.
- **Over-allocating to early hires.** Granting too much equity to the first few employees leaves insufficient shares for later hires who may be equally or more critical to the company's success.
- **Ignoring tax implications.** Equity instruments have significant tax consequences. Failing to file an 83(b) election on restricted stock, for example, can result in a large tax bill when shares vest at a higher valuation.
- **Not using written agreements.** Verbal understandings about equity create ambiguity that becomes toxic during disputes, fundraising, or exits.

## Summary

Startup equity division is the foundational process of allocating ownership among founders, employees, advisors, and investors. It requires balancing fairness, incentive alignment, and long-term flexibility. Founders should negotiate their split based on clearly defined contributions and commitment levels, implement vesting schedules to protect against early departures, reserve an option pool large enough to attract talent across multiple stages, and understand how each funding round will dilute existing holders. Documenting everything in written agreements, consulting legal and tax professionals, and revisiting the equity plan as the company evolves are essential practices that separate well-run startups from those that fracture under the weight of misaligned expectations.
