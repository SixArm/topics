## Startup Equity Division: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

### What is Startup Equity Division?

Startup equity division is the process of allocating ownership shares among founders, employees, and investors. This allocation determines who owns what percentage of the company and directly impacts motivation, alignment of interests, and long-term retention of key stakeholders. Getting equity division right is one of the most consequential decisions a startup will make.

### Why Equity Division Matters

Equity represents ownership in the company's future value. Unlike salary, which compensates for current work, equity compensates for risk-taking and long-term commitment. Poor equity decisions made early can lead to founder disputes, employee dissatisfaction, and difficulty raising capital. The decisions you make at incorporation will echo throughout the company's lifecycle.

### The Three Core Stakeholder Groups

| Stakeholder | When They Receive Equity | Typical Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Founders | At incorporation | Direct share allocation | Reward for initial risk and vision |
| Employees | Upon hiring or promotion | Stock options (ISO/NSO) | Attract talent, align incentives |
| Investors | At funding rounds | Preferred stock purchase | Capital injection for growth |

### Founder Equity Division

Founders are the first to divide equity, and this division sets the foundation for everything that follows. There are two primary approaches:

**Equal Split**
- Simple and signals trust
- Works when founders contribute equally and have similar roles
- Can cause problems if contributions diverge over time

**Unequal Split**
- Reflects different contributions, roles, or opportunity costs
- More complex to negotiate but potentially fairer
- Requires honest conversations about value

**Factors to Consider When Splitting Founder Equity:**

- **Idea origination**: Who conceived the core concept?
- **Domain expertise**: Who brings specialized knowledge?
- **Time commitment**: Full-time versus part-time involvement
- **Capital contribution**: Who invested initial funds?
- **Opportunity cost**: What are founders giving up?
- **Role and responsibility**: CEO, CTO, and other leadership positions
- **Network and connections**: Access to investors, customers, or talent

### The Employee Option Pool

Before raising outside investment, startups typically create an option pool—shares reserved for future employees. This pool usually ranges from 10% to 20% of total shares.

| Company Stage | Typical Option Pool Size |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Pre-seed | 10-15% |
| Seed | 15-20% |
| Series A | 10-15% (refreshed) |
| Series B+ | 5-10% (refreshed) |

**Stock Option Types:**

| Option Type | Tax Treatment | Best For |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Incentive Stock Options (ISO) | Favorable capital gains treatment | U.S. employees |
| Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSO) | Ordinary income tax on exercise | Contractors, advisors, international |
| Restricted Stock Units (RSU) | Tax at vesting | Later-stage companies |

### Employee Equity Guidelines by Role

| Role Level | Early Stage (Seed) | Growth Stage (Series A-B) |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| C-Level Executive | 1-5% | 0.5-2% |
| VP Level | 0.5-2% | 0.25-1% |
| Director | 0.25-1% | 0.1-0.5% |
| Senior Engineer | 0.1-0.5% | 0.05-0.25% |
| Junior Engineer | 0.01-0.1% | 0.01-0.05% |

These ranges vary significantly based on company valuation, location, and competitive dynamics.

### Investor Equity Allocation

Investors receive equity in exchange for capital. The amount they receive depends on:

- **Investment amount**: How much capital they're providing
- **Pre-money valuation**: The company's agreed value before investment
- **Investment terms**: Liquidation preferences, participation rights, and anti-dilution provisions

**Example Calculation:**

If a company has a $4M pre-money valuation and raises $1M:
- Post-money valuation = $5M
- Investor ownership = $1M / $5M = 20%

### Vesting: Protecting the Company and Stakeholders

Vesting schedules ensure that equity is earned over time rather than granted immediately. This protects the company if someone leaves early.

**Standard Vesting Structure:**

| Component | Typical Terms |
|-----------|---------------|
| Total vesting period | 4 years |
| Cliff period | 1 year |
| Post-cliff vesting | Monthly or quarterly |
| Acceleration triggers | Single or double trigger |

**How the Cliff Works:**

- No equity vests during the first year
- At the one-year mark, 25% vests immediately
- Remaining 75% vests monthly over the next 36 months

**Acceleration Clauses:**

- **Single trigger**: Vesting accelerates upon acquisition
- **Double trigger**: Vesting accelerates only if acquired AND terminated

Double trigger is more common and investor-friendly.

### Dilution: Understanding Your Shrinking Percentage

As a company raises more capital, existing shareholders' percentages decrease. This is dilution.

| Funding Event | New Investor % | Founder Dilution | Employee Dilution |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Seed ($1M at $4M pre) | 20% | Founders go from 100% to 80% | — |
| Series A ($5M at $15M pre) | 25% | Founders go from 80% to 60% | Options from 15% to 11.25% |
| Series B ($15M at $60M pre) | 20% | Founders go from 60% to 48% | Options from 11.25% to 9% |

Dilution isn't inherently bad if it increases the company's total value. Owning 10% of a $100M company is better than owning 50% of a $10M company.

### Key Legal Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Certificate of Incorporation | Establishes the company and authorizes shares |
| Stock Purchase Agreement | Governs founder share purchases |
| Option Agreement | Details employee option grants |
| 83(b) Election | Tax election for early-exercised shares |
| Investor Rights Agreement | Defines investor protections and rights |

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Delaying founder equity conversations**: Discuss early when stakes are lower
- **Ignoring vesting**: Even founders should vest to protect against departures
- **Over-promising to early employees**: Reserve equity for future hires
- **Undervaluing advisors appropriately**: Standard is 0.1-0.5% over 2 years
- **Neglecting the option pool in negotiations**: Investors often require pools that dilute founders pre-investment
- **Forgetting 83(b) elections**: Missing the 30-day deadline can result in significant tax consequences

### Advisor Equity Guidelines

| Advisor Involvement | Standard Grant | Vesting Period |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Light (monthly calls) | 0.1-0.25% | 2 years |
| Moderate (weekly engagement) | 0.25-0.5% | 2 years |
| Heavy (deep involvement) | 0.5-1% | 2 years |

### Best Practices for Equity Division

- **Document everything**: Use written agreements for all equity grants
- **Model future dilution**: Create cap table projections through Series B
- **Communicate transparently**: Ensure all stakeholders understand their grants
- **Review regularly**: Reassess equity strategy at each funding round
- **Seek professional help**: Engage a startup attorney for legal documents
- **Use standard terms**: Unusual terms create friction with future investors

### Summary

Startup equity division requires balancing fairness, motivation, and long-term company health. Founders must thoughtfully allocate shares among themselves, reserve sufficient options for employees, and understand how investor rounds will dilute existing holders. Vesting protects everyone by ensuring equity is earned over time. The decisions made early will shape relationships and incentives for years—approach them with care, documentation, and professional guidance.
