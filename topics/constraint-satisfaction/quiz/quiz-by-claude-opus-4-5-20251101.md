# Constraint satisfaction

Question: What is the primary goal of constraint satisfaction in AI and operations research?

- [ ] To maximize the number of variables in a problem
- [ ] To eliminate all constraints from a system
- [ ] To find values for variables that satisfy all defined constraints
- [ ] To convert logical expressions into arithmetic expressions

  <p>To find values for variables that satisfy all defined constraints</p>
  <p>Constraint satisfaction is a technique that expresses a problem as a set of variables with possible values and a set of constraints defining relationships between those variables. The goal is to find an assignment of values to all variables such that every constraint is satisfied. This approach is widely used in scheduling, planning, and optimization problems.</p>
