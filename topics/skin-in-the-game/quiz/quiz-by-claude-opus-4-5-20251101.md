  <p>To ensure decision-makers bear personal consequences aligned with outcomes</p>
  <p>"Skin in the game" means having a personal stake in the outcome of decisions, which aligns the interests of decision-makers with those affected by their choices. When individuals have something to lose if a venture fails, they are more likely to act in the best interest of the project rather than making decisions with little personal consequence while others bear the risks.</p>
