# Edit distance algorithm

Question: What are the three fundamental single-character operations that the Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance) algorithm uses to transform one string into another?

- [ ] Insertion, deletion, and reversal
- [ ] Insertion, deletion, and substitution
- [ ] Substitution, transposition, and deletion
- [ ] Insertion, concatenation, and replacement

  <p>Insertion, deletion, and substitution</p>
  <p>The Edit Distance algorithm calculates the minimum number of single-character edits needed to transform one string into another. These three operations—insertion (adding a character), deletion (removing a character), and substitution (replacing one character with another)—form the complete set of edits the algorithm considers when computing the distance between two strings.</p>
