  <p>A provision ensuring preferred stockholders are paid before common stockholders in a sale or liquidation</p>
  <p>A liquidation preference is a right typically granted to investors holding preferred stock that guarantees they will be paid out before common stockholders (such as founders and employees) in the event of a company sale or liquidation. This is a critical concept for technology professionals to understand because it directly affects how proceeds from an exit are distributed, and can significantly impact the actual value of equity held by employees and founders.</p>
