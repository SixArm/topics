## Equity: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

Equity represents ownership interest in a company. For technology professionals—whether you're a founder, employee at a startup, or considering joining one—understanding equity is essential for evaluating compensation packages, making career decisions, and understanding your financial stake in a company's success.

## What Is Equity?

Equity is a claim on a company's assets and future earnings. When you own equity in a company, you own a piece of that company. The value of your equity depends on the company's valuation and your percentage of ownership.

For startups, equity serves three primary purposes:

- **Ownership representation**: Founders hold equity to reflect their stake in the company they built
- **Capital raising**: Investors receive equity in exchange for funding
- **Employee compensation**: Equity-based compensation attracts and retains talent when cash is limited

## Types of Equity

| Type | Voting Rights | Dividend Priority | Liquidation Priority | Typical Holders |
|------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Common Stock | Yes | Last | Last | Founders, employees |
| Preferred Stock | Usually no | First | First | Investors |
| Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) | After vesting | After vesting | After vesting | Employees |
| Stock Options | After exercise | After exercise | After exercise | Employees |

### Common Stock

Common stock is the most basic form of equity. Holders of common stock have:

- Voting rights at shareholder meetings
- Rights to dividends (when declared)
- Claim on assets after all other obligations are paid

Founders and employees typically hold common stock. In a liquidation event, common stockholders are paid last—after creditors, bondholders, and preferred stockholders.

### Preferred Stock

Preferred stock provides investors with enhanced protections and privileges:

- **Liquidation preference**: Investors get paid before common stockholders during a sale or liquidation
- **Anti-dilution protection**: Safeguards against ownership dilution in future funding rounds
- **Participation rights**: Some preferred stock allows investors to receive their liquidation preference plus a share of remaining proceeds
- **Conversion rights**: Ability to convert preferred shares to common stock

Venture capitalists and institutional investors typically receive preferred stock in exchange for their investment.

## Equity Compensation for Employees

Technology companies frequently use equity to compensate employees, particularly when they cannot match the cash salaries offered by larger competitors.

### Stock Options

Stock options give you the right to purchase shares at a predetermined price (the strike price or exercise price). If the company's value increases, you can buy shares below market value and realize a gain.

Key terms:

- **Grant date**: When you receive the option
- **Vesting period**: Time before you can exercise options (typically 4 years with a 1-year cliff)
- **Exercise price**: The price you pay to buy shares
- **Expiration date**: Deadline to exercise (typically 10 years from grant, or 90 days after leaving)

| Option Type | Tax Treatment | Exercise Cost | Risk Level |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) | Favorable (capital gains) | Upfront | Lower AMT risk if held |
| Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs) | Ordinary income at exercise | Upfront | Higher immediate tax |

### Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

RSUs are promises to deliver shares after vesting conditions are met. Unlike options, RSUs have value even if the stock price drops below the grant price.

- No exercise price required
- Taxed as ordinary income when shares are delivered
- Common at public companies and late-stage startups

### Restricted Stock

Restricted stock is actual stock granted to employees, subject to vesting and potential forfeiture. Employees may file an 83(b) election to pay taxes on the stock's value at grant rather than at vesting, potentially reducing tax liability if the stock appreciates.

## Understanding Vesting

Vesting determines when you actually own your equity. The standard vesting schedule in tech is:

- **4-year vesting period**: Total time to earn all equity
- **1-year cliff**: No equity vests until 12 months of employment
- **Monthly vesting**: After the cliff, equity vests monthly

Example: You receive 10,000 options with a 4-year vesting schedule and 1-year cliff. After 12 months, 2,500 options vest immediately. Then 208.33 options vest each month for the remaining 36 months.

## Dilution

Dilution occurs when a company issues new shares, reducing your percentage ownership. This happens during:

- New funding rounds
- Employee stock option pool increases
- Convertible note conversions
- Warrant exercises

Dilution is normal and expected. What matters is whether the company's increased valuation offsets your reduced percentage ownership. Owning 1% of a $100 million company is worth more than owning 2% of a $10 million company.

### Anti-Dilution Protection

Investors often negotiate anti-dilution provisions to protect their ownership percentage:

| Protection Type | Mechanism | Impact on Common Stockholders |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Full Ratchet | Adjusts price to lowest subsequent price | Severe dilution |
| Weighted Average | Adjusts based on new shares and price | Moderate dilution |
| No Protection | No adjustment | No additional dilution |

## Liquidation Preferences

Liquidation preferences determine the payout order when a company is sold or liquidated. Understanding these is crucial for estimating what your equity might be worth in an exit.

### Types of Liquidation Preferences

- **1x non-participating**: Investors receive their investment back OR convert to common stock (whichever is greater)
- **1x participating**: Investors receive their investment back AND share in remaining proceeds
- **Multiple preferences (2x, 3x)**: Investors receive 2x or 3x their investment before common stockholders

Example with $10M investment at $40M valuation (25% ownership):

| Exit Value | 1x Non-Participating | 1x Participating |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| $20M | $10M (preference) | $10M + $2.5M = $12.5M |
| $50M | $12.5M (converts) | $10M + $10M = $20M |
| $100M | $25M (converts) | $10M + $22.5M = $32.5M |

## Evaluating Equity Offers

When assessing an equity offer, consider these factors:

### Key Questions to Ask

- What is the current company valuation?
- How many fully diluted shares are outstanding?
- What class of stock am I receiving?
- What is the vesting schedule?
- What is the exercise price (for options)?
- What liquidation preferences exist?
- What is the company's runway and fundraising plans?

### Calculating Your Ownership Percentage

Your ownership percentage = (Your shares / Fully diluted shares) × 100

Fully diluted shares include:
- All outstanding common stock
- All outstanding preferred stock (as if converted)
- All outstanding options (vested and unvested)
- Remaining option pool

### Red Flags

- Unusually long vesting periods or cliffs
- Single-trigger acceleration absent from agreements
- Aggressive liquidation preferences (3x+ participating)
- Very short exercise windows after departure
- Unclear or unavailable cap table information

## Tax Considerations

Equity compensation creates tax obligations that vary based on the type of equity and when you take action.

| Event | ISOs | NSOs | RSUs |
|-------|------|------|------|
| Grant | No tax | No tax | No tax |
| Vesting | No tax (but AMT possible) | No tax | Ordinary income |
| Exercise | No regular tax (AMT possible) | Ordinary income on spread | N/A |
| Sale | Capital gains (if qualified) | Capital gains on post-exercise gain | Capital gains on post-vest gain |

Consult a tax professional familiar with equity compensation—the rules are complex and mistakes can be costly.

## Key Takeaways

- Equity represents ownership in a company, with value tied to the company's success
- Common stock is typical for founders and employees; preferred stock is typical for investors
- Vesting protects companies from employees leaving early with full equity grants
- Dilution reduces your percentage ownership but does not necessarily reduce value
- Liquidation preferences significantly impact what common stockholders receive in an exit
- Tax treatment varies by equity type and timing of exercise and sale

Understanding equity is fundamental to making informed decisions about your career and compensation in the technology industry. Take time to understand your equity grants, ask questions, and consider consulting professionals when making significant financial decisions about exercising options or evaluating offers.
