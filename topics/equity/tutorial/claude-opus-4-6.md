# Equity

Equity represents ownership interest in a company, entitling its holders to a share of the company's assets, profits, and decision-making power. For technology professionals, understanding equity is essential whether you are founding a startup, joining one as an early employee, raising venture capital, or negotiating compensation. Equity defines how value is distributed among stakeholders and shapes the incentives that drive a company forward.

## What Equity Means in Practice

At its core, equity is a claim on value. When you hold equity in a company, you own a percentage of that entity. If the company grows and becomes more valuable, your equity becomes more valuable in turn. If the company fails, your equity may become worthless. This risk-reward dynamic is what makes equity fundamentally different from salary or debt. Unlike a paycheck, equity does not guarantee a return, but it offers the potential for outsized gains if the company succeeds.

Equity ownership is tracked through shares. A company authorizes a certain number of shares, and each share represents a fractional ownership stake. The percentage you own is determined by dividing the number of shares you hold by the total number of outstanding shares. This percentage can change over time through dilution as new shares are issued to investors, employees, or other parties.

## Classes of Equity

Equity can be divided into different classes, each with its own rights and privileges. The two most common classes in the startup context are common stock and preferred stock.

| Class | Typical Holders | Voting Rights | Dividend Priority | Liquidation Priority |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Common Stock | Founders, employees | Yes | Lower | Last to be paid |
| Preferred Stock | Investors (VCs, angels) | Usually limited or none | Higher | Paid before common |

**Common stock** is the most basic form of equity. It gives holders the right to vote at shareholder meetings and receive dividends, though startups rarely pay dividends. Common stockholders are last in line to receive proceeds in a liquidation event.

**Preferred stock** carries special rights that protect investors. These rights often include a liquidation preference, meaning preferred stockholders are paid out before common stockholders in a sale or liquidation. Preferred stock may also include anti-dilution protection, participation rights, and conversion rights that allow preferred shares to be converted into common shares under certain conditions.

## Equity as Compensation

Technology companies, particularly startups, use equity as a critical tool for attracting and retaining talent. Because early-stage companies often cannot compete with large corporations on salary alone, they offer equity to bridge the gap and align employees with the long-term success of the business.

The most common equity compensation instruments include:

- **Stock options**: The right to purchase shares at a predetermined price (the strike price or exercise price) at a future date. If the company's value increases beyond the strike price, the option holder profits from the difference.
- **Restricted stock units (RSUs)**: A promise to deliver shares to the employee after certain conditions are met, typically a vesting schedule tied to continued employment. RSUs are more common at later-stage and public companies.
- **Restricted stock awards**: Actual shares granted to the employee, often subject to a vesting schedule and sometimes a repurchase right if the employee leaves early.
- **Employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs)**: Programs that allow employees to purchase company stock at a discount, typically offered by public companies.

## Vesting and Cliffs

Equity compensation is almost always subject to a vesting schedule, which ensures that employees earn their equity over time rather than receiving it all at once. The standard vesting schedule in the technology industry is four years with a one-year cliff.

Under this arrangement, the employee earns no equity during the first year. At the one-year mark (the cliff), 25% of the equity vests all at once. After that, the remaining equity vests in equal monthly or quarterly increments over the following three years. This structure protects the company from granting significant equity to employees who leave shortly after joining.

## Dilution

Dilution occurs when a company issues new shares, reducing the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. This happens most commonly during fundraising rounds when new investors purchase equity. While dilution reduces your percentage ownership, it does not necessarily reduce the value of your holdings if the new shares are issued at a higher valuation.

For example, if you own 10% of a company valued at $1 million, your stake is worth $100,000. If the company raises a new round at a $5 million post-money valuation and your ownership is diluted to 6%, your stake is now worth $300,000. Your percentage went down, but the value went up. Understanding this distinction is important when evaluating equity offers and fundraising events.

## Founder Equity Considerations

Founders must make critical decisions about equity allocation early in the life of a company. Key considerations include:

- **Co-founder splits**: How equity is divided among co-founders, based on factors such as contribution, risk, capital invested, and role.
- **Option pool**: A reserve of shares set aside for future employees, typically 10-20% of total shares. Investors often require the option pool to be established before their investment, which dilutes the founders.
- **Vesting for founders**: Even founders should vest their equity to protect against a co-founder departing early while retaining a large ownership stake.
- **83(b) election**: A U.S. tax provision that allows founders and early employees to pay taxes on the value of restricted stock at the time of grant rather than at the time of vesting, potentially saving significant money if the company's value increases.

## Cap Table Management

The capitalization table (cap table) is the ledger that records who owns what in a company. It lists all shareholders, the number and class of shares they hold, and the resulting ownership percentages. Maintaining an accurate cap table is essential for fundraising, issuing equity compensation, and planning liquidity events.

As a company grows through multiple financing rounds, the cap table becomes increasingly complex. It must account for common stock, multiple series of preferred stock, outstanding options, warrants, convertible notes, and SAFEs. Technology professionals involved in finance, operations, or leadership should understand how to read and interpret a cap table.

## Key Terms at a Glance

| Tag-along rights | Provisions that allow minority shareholders to join a sale initiated by majority shareholders |

## Summary

Equity is the foundation of ownership and incentive alignment in technology companies. It comes in multiple forms, from common stock held by founders and employees to preferred stock held by investors, each carrying different rights and protections. Equity compensation through stock options, RSUs, and related instruments is a defining feature of the technology industry and a powerful tool for attracting talent. Understanding how equity is issued, vested, diluted, and valued is essential for anyone building, joining, or investing in a technology company.
