  <p>Risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk sharing, and risk acceptance</p>
  <p>These are the four primary risk mitigation strategies. Risk avoidance eliminates the activity causing the risk. Risk reduction implements measures to lower likelihood or impact. Risk sharing transfers the risk to another party (such as an insurance company). Risk acceptance acknowledges the risk and implements a plan to minimize its impact.</p>
