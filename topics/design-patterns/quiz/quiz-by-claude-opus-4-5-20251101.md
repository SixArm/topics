  <p>Creational patterns</p>
  <p>Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. Examples include Singleton (ensuring only one instance), Factory (delegating instantiation to subclasses), Abstract Factory (creating families of related objects), and Builder (constructing complex objects step by step). These patterns abstract the instantiation process, making systems independent of how objects are created, composed, and represented.</p>
