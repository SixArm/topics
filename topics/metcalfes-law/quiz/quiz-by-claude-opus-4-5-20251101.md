  <p>Proportionally to the square of the number of users</p>
  <p>Metcalfe's Law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users (n²). This is because as more users join, the number of possible connections between them increases exponentially, creating more opportunities for communication, collaboration, and commerce. This principle explains why social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn become increasingly valuable as their user base grows.</p>
