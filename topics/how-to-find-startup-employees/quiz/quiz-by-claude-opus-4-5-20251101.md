  <p>Offering incentives like equity, flexible work hours, and other perks</p>
  <p>Startups often cannot compete with larger companies on salary alone. By offering incentives such as equity stakes, flexible work arrangements, and unique perks, startups can attract top talent who are motivated by ownership opportunities, work-life balance, and the chance to be part of something from the ground floor. This strategy compensates for lower initial salaries while aligning employee interests with company success.</p>
