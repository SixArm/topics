  <p>A business plan is a written document that describes in detail the goals, strategies, and tactics a company will undertake to achieve its objectives. Its primary purpose is to provide a clear roadmap for the company, align employees, help secure funding, and communicate the company's vision and values to stakeholders. While technical documentation, HR policies, and legal agreements are important, they serve different purposes than the strategic roadmap a business plan provides.</p>
