# Continuous Deployment

Question: What distinguishes Continuous Deployment from Continuous Integration in the software delivery pipeline?

- [ ] Continuous Deployment focuses on merging code changes into a shared repository
- [ ] Continuous Deployment requires manual approval before each production release
- [ ] Continuous Deployment automatically deploys code changes to production after passing all tests and quality checks
- [ ] Continuous Deployment only runs automated tests without deploying code

  <p>Continuous Deployment automatically deploys code changes to production after passing all tests and quality checks</p>
  <p>Continuous Deployment builds upon Continuous Integration by adding automated deployment to production environments without requiring human intervention. While CI focuses on frequently integrating and testing code changes in a shared repository, CD takes this further by automatically pushing those validated changes to production, reducing the time between writing code and delivering it to users.</p>
