# Definition of Value (DoV)

Value in agile software engineering represents the measurable benefit or worth that software features, functions, or deliverables provide to end users, customers, or the business. It serves as the primary criterion for prioritizing work and making decisions throughout the development process.

Value is typically assessed from multiple perspectives, including business value, user value, and technical value. Business value encompasses revenue generation, cost reduction, market positioning, and competitive advantage. User value focuses on improved user experience, enhanced functionality, problem-solving capabilities, and meeting user needs effectively. Technical value includes maintainability, scalability, performance improvements, and reduced technical debt that enables future development efficiency.

In agile methodologies, value drives prioritization through techniques like user story mapping, value-based backlog management, and regular stakeholder feedback. Product owners and teams collaborate to identify and rank features based on their potential value delivery, often using frameworks like the Kano model or value versus effort matrices. This approach ensures that the most valuable features are developed first, maximizing return on investment and delivering early wins to stakeholders.

By maintaining focus on continuous delivery of value, agile teams can respond effectively to changing requirements while consistently producing meaningful outcomes that justify development investments.
