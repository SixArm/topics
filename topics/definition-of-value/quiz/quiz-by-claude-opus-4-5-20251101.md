  <p>Business value, user value, and technical value</p>
  <p>In agile software engineering, value is assessed from three key perspectives: business value (revenue, cost reduction, market positioning), user value (user experience, functionality, problem-solving), and technical value (maintainability, scalability, reduced technical debt). This multi-dimensional view ensures teams deliver meaningful outcomes across all stakeholder concerns.</p>
