# Definition of Value: Tutorial

## Overview

Value in agile software engineering represents the measurable benefit that software features and deliverables provide to end users, customers, or the business. It serves as the primary criterion for prioritizing work—the most valuable work should be done first.

## Three Dimensions of Value

Value is not one-dimensional. It is assessed from multiple perspectives:

### Business Value

The benefit to the organization:
- Revenue generation or increase
- Cost reduction or avoidance
- Market positioning and competitive advantage
- Risk mitigation
- Regulatory compliance

### User Value

The benefit to the end user:
- Improved experience and usability
- Enhanced functionality and capability
- Time savings and efficiency gains
- Problem resolution
- Reduced friction and frustration

### Technical Value

The benefit to the software system and development process:
- Improved maintainability and code quality
- Better scalability and performance
- Reduced technical debt
- Increased development velocity for future work
- Enhanced security and reliability

## Why Defining Value Matters

### Prioritization

Without a clear definition of value, backlog prioritization becomes subjective. Teams may default to building what is easiest, what the loudest stakeholder requests, or what is technically interesting—none of which necessarily deliver the most value.

### Trade-Off Decisions

Every sprint involves trade-offs. When the team understands what value means in their context, they can make informed decisions about what to build, what to defer, and what to cut.

### Stakeholder Alignment

Different stakeholders may have different definitions of value. Making the definition explicit forces alignment and prevents conflicts during prioritization.

## Frameworks for Assessing Value

### Value vs. Effort Matrix

Plot potential features on a two-axis grid: value (high/low) on one axis and effort (high/low) on the other. Prioritize high-value, low-effort items first.

### Kano Model

Categorize features into:
- **Must-haves**: Expected by users; absence causes dissatisfaction
- **Performance features**: More is better; directly correlated with satisfaction
- **Delighters**: Unexpected features that create excitement; absence does not cause dissatisfaction

### Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)

Calculate priority by dividing the cost of delay (business value + time criticality + risk reduction) by the job duration. Higher WSJF scores indicate higher priority.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

Categorize items as Must have, Should have, Could have, or Won't have. This forces explicit decisions about what is essential versus desirable.

## Practical Steps

1. **Define what value means for your product**: Collaborate with stakeholders to articulate the specific dimensions of value that matter most—revenue, user adoption, retention, efficiency, compliance, or other factors.
2. **Make value visible in the backlog**: Each backlog item should have a clear value statement explaining why it matters and to whom.
3. **Prioritize by value, not urgency**: Urgent items are not always valuable, and valuable items are not always urgent. Use a prioritization framework to separate the two.
4. **Measure value delivered**: After releasing features, measure whether the expected value was actually realized. This feedback improves future value assessments.
5. **Balance value dimensions**: Do not focus exclusively on business or user value at the expense of technical value. Neglecting technical value creates debt that reduces future delivery capacity.

## Key Takeaway

Value is the compass that guides agile teams. Every decision—what to build, what to prioritize, what to cut—should be informed by a clear understanding of what constitutes value for users, the business, and the technical system. Make your definition of value explicit, use it consistently in prioritization, and measure whether you are actually delivering it.
