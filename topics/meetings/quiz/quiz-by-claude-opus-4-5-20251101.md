  <p>A clear purpose or objective</p>
  <p>Every meeting should have a clear purpose or objective as the foundational element. Without a defined purpose—whether it's sharing information, making decisions, brainstorming ideas, problem-solving, or planning—meetings become unfocused and waste participants' time. A clear objective guides the agenda, determines who should attend, and provides criteria for measuring whether the meeting was successful.</p>
