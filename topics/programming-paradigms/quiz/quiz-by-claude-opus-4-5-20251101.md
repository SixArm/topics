  <p>Declarative Programming</p>
  <p>Declarative Programming tells the system what it should accomplish, rather than how it should accomplish it, by focusing on constraints, logic, and rules. This contrasts with imperative and procedural paradigms, which explicitly specify step-by-step instructions for how to achieve a result.</p>
