  <p>It streamlines the transaction process by reducing negotiation time for individual transactions</p>
  <p>A framework agreement establishes general terms and conditions upfront (pricing, delivery, quality standards, warranties, etc.), which reduces the time and effort required to negotiate each individual transaction. This is particularly valuable when there is a high volume of transactions or when transactions are complex. Additionally, it provides greater certainty and predictability for both parties by avoiding misunderstandings that may arise later in the relationship.</p>
