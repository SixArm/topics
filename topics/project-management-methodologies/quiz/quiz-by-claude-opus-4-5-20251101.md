  <p>Waterfall Methodology</p>
  <p>Waterfall follows a sequential, linear approach to project management with distinct phases that must be completed in order. Unlike iterative methodologies like Agile or Scrum, Waterfall requires each phase to be fully finished before moving to the next, making it suitable for projects with well-defined requirements upfront but less flexible when changes are needed mid-project.</p>
