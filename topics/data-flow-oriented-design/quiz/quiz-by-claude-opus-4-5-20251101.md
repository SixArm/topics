# Data Flow-Oriented Design

Question: What is the primary purpose of the context diagram in Data Flow-Oriented Design?

- [ ] To show detailed subprocesses and data stores within each module
- [ ] To provide an overview of the system and its environment
- [ ] To represent the physical implementation of database structures
- [ ] To define the object classes and their inheritance relationships

  <p>To provide an overview of the system and its environment</p>
  <p>In DFD's levels of abstraction, the context diagram is the first level that provides a high-level overview of the system and its environment, showing how the system interacts with external entities. Subsequent levels (level-0 and beyond) progressively add more detail about processes, data flows, subprocesses, and data stores.</p>
