# Vesting schedule

A vesting schedule is the timeline and structure that governs how equity compensation — such as stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), or other equity instruments — is earned by an individual over time. Rather than granting full ownership of equity on day one, companies distribute it incrementally based on continued employment, tenure milestones, or performance targets. Vesting schedules are a cornerstone of startup and technology company compensation, aligning employee incentives with long-term company success and reducing the risk of granting equity to individuals who leave early.

## Why vesting schedules matter

Vesting schedules serve several strategic purposes for both employers and employees. For the company, they act as a retention mechanism: employees who leave before their equity fully vests forfeit the unvested portion, which incentivizes them to stay and contribute over a meaningful period. For employees, vesting schedules represent a clear path to ownership and wealth creation, especially in high-growth startups where equity can become extremely valuable after a liquidity event such as an IPO or acquisition. Vesting also protects co-founders from one another — if a co-founder departs early, the company retains the unvested shares rather than allowing a non-contributing party to hold a significant ownership stake.

## Common vesting structures

The most widely used vesting schedule in the technology industry is the four-year vest with a one-year cliff. Under this model, an employee receives no equity during the first year. At the one-year mark (the cliff), 25% of the total grant vests at once. After the cliff, the remaining 75% vests in equal monthly or quarterly installments over the next three years. This structure balances the company's need for retention with the employee's desire for regular equity accumulation.

| Structure | Description | Typical use case |
|---|---|---|
| Four-year with one-year cliff | 25% vests at 12 months, remainder vests monthly or quarterly over 36 months | Standard for startups and most tech companies |
| Straight-line (linear) vesting | Equal portions vest at regular intervals over the full period | Companies seeking simplicity and predictability |
| Graded (back-weighted) vesting | Larger portions vest in later years (e.g., 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%) | Companies emphasizing long-term retention, notably Amazon |
| Immediate vesting | Full ownership granted at time of award | Signing bonuses or senior executive packages |
| Milestone-based vesting | Equity vests upon achieving specific performance or business goals | Performance-driven cultures or project-based roles |

## The cliff period

The cliff is the minimum tenure required before any equity vests. In practice, a one-year cliff is standard across the technology industry. The cliff exists to protect the company from granting equity to employees who leave shortly after joining. If an employee departs before the cliff date, they forfeit the entire equity grant. Once the cliff is reached, the first tranche of equity vests immediately — typically 25% of the total grant — and subsequent vesting occurs on a monthly or quarterly cadence.

Some companies use shorter cliffs of three or six months, particularly for senior hires or in competitive talent markets where candidates negotiate more favorable terms. Co-founder agreements sometimes have no cliff at all, or use a retroactive cliff that credits time already worked prior to incorporation.

## Time-based versus performance-based vesting

Most vesting schedules are time-based, meaning equity vests purely as a function of continued employment. This is straightforward to administer and easy for employees to understand. However, some companies incorporate performance-based vesting, where equity is earned only when specific goals are met.

- **Time-based vesting** rewards loyalty and tenure. The employee need only remain employed to earn equity. This is the default for most stock option and RSU grants at technology companies.
- **Performance-based vesting** ties equity to measurable outcomes such as revenue targets, product launches, or individual performance metrics. It is more common for executive-level grants and public company performance share units (PSUs).
- **Hybrid vesting** combines both approaches: equity vests over time but can be accelerated or increased based on performance achievements.

Performance-based vesting introduces complexity in administration and can create uncertainty for employees, which is why pure time-based vesting remains dominant for rank-and-file technology professionals.

## Acceleration provisions

Acceleration provisions allow equity to vest faster than the original schedule under specific triggering events. These provisions are particularly important in the context of mergers, acquisitions, and other changes of control.

- **Single-trigger acceleration** causes some or all unvested equity to vest immediately upon a single event, typically a change of control such as an acquisition. This protects the employee regardless of whether they remain employed after the transaction.
- **Double-trigger acceleration** requires two events before acceleration occurs: a change of control and a subsequent qualifying termination (such as being laid off or having one's role materially changed). Double-trigger is more common because it avoids the "golden parachute" problem where employees vest fully and leave immediately after an acquisition.
- **Good leaver / bad leaver provisions** define what happens to unvested equity based on the circumstances of departure. A "good leaver" (e.g., terminated without cause) may retain or accelerate unvested shares, while a "bad leaver" (e.g., terminated for cause) forfeits them entirely.

## Equity types and how vesting applies

| Equity type | How vesting works | Tax considerations |
|---|---|---|
| Incentive stock options (ISOs) | Options vest over time; employee can exercise vested options to purchase shares at the strike price | Favorable tax treatment if holding periods are met; AMT may apply at exercise |
| Non-qualified stock options (NSOs) | Same vesting mechanics as ISOs; no statutory holding period requirement | Taxed as ordinary income at exercise on the spread between strike price and fair market value |
| Restricted stock units (RSUs) | Units vest over time; shares are delivered upon vesting with no exercise required | Taxed as ordinary income at vesting based on fair market value |
| Restricted stock awards (RSAs) | Shares are granted immediately but subject to forfeiture if vesting conditions are not met | 83(b) election allows taxation at grant date rather than vesting date |

## Negotiating your vesting schedule

Technology professionals, especially those joining startups or negotiating senior roles, can and should negotiate vesting terms. Key points to consider include:

- **Cliff length**: Negotiate a shorter cliff (six months or less) if you have strong leverage or are taking significant risk by joining an early-stage company.
- **Vesting period**: While four years is standard, some candidates negotiate three-year schedules, particularly when moving from a company where they are leaving behind unvested equity.
- **Acceleration clauses**: Request double-trigger acceleration to protect your equity in the event of an acquisition followed by termination.
- **Refresh grants**: Ensure the offer includes provisions for additional equity grants (refresh grants) after the initial vesting period, so your total compensation does not decline over time.
- **Early exercise**: Some companies allow early exercise of unvested options, enabling you to file an 83(b) election and potentially reduce your long-term tax burden.

## Summary

A vesting schedule is the mechanism by which equity compensation is earned over time, serving as both a retention tool for companies and a wealth-building pathway for employees. The industry-standard four-year schedule with a one-year cliff remains dominant in the technology sector, though variations such as graded vesting, performance-based vesting, and acceleration provisions offer flexibility for different organizational needs and individual negotiations. Technology professionals should understand the mechanics of their vesting schedule, the type of equity they hold, and the tax implications at each stage — from grant to exercise to sale — to make informed career and financial decisions.
