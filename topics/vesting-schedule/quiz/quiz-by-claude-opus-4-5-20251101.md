  <p>To specify the minimum time an employee must work before becoming eligible for any equity</p>
  <p>The cliff is the minimum period of time (typically ranging from one month to one year) an employee must work for the company before they become eligible for any equity. If an employee leaves before the cliff period ends, they forfeit all unvested equity. Once the cliff is reached, the vesting period begins and the employee starts earning their equity according to the schedule.</p>
