  <p>Double-entry bookkeeping with debits and credits in separate accounts</p>
  <p>A ledger database is specifically designed to support double-entry bookkeeping, which is a fundamental accounting system that records both the debit and credit aspects of each transaction in separate accounts. This ensures that the accounting equation (assets = liabilities + equity) always remains balanced and provides a complete audit trail of all financial transactions.</p>
