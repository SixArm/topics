## Gross Profit and Net Profit

Gross profit and net profit are two fundamental financial metrics that every technology professional should understand. Whether you're evaluating a potential employer, analyzing your startup's financial health, negotiating with investors, or simply reading quarterly earnings reports, these metrics reveal critical insights about a company's profitability and operational efficiency.

## What Is Gross Profit?

Gross profit measures the money remaining after subtracting the direct costs of producing goods or services from total revenue. These direct costs are called **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**.

**Formula:**
> Gross Profit = Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

For a SaaS company, COGS typically includes:

- Cloud hosting and infrastructure costs (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Third-party software licenses embedded in the product
- Customer support directly tied to product delivery
- Payment processing fees
- Content delivery network costs

Gross profit reveals how efficiently a company produces its core product or service before accounting for overhead expenses like marketing, rent, or executive salaries.

## What Is Net Profit?

Net profit represents the money remaining after subtracting **all** business expenses from revenue—not just direct production costs, but also operating expenses, interest, taxes, and every other cost incurred to run the business.

**Formula:**
> Net Profit = Revenue − COGS − Operating Expenses − Interest − Taxes − All Other Expenses

This is the "bottom line"—the actual profit a company retains. Net profit determines whether a business is truly profitable or operating at a loss.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Gross Profit | Net Profit |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **What it measures** | Revenue minus direct production costs | Revenue minus all expenses |
| **Expenses included** | Only COGS | COGS, operating expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation |
| **Position on income statement** | Upper portion | Bottom line |
| **What it reveals** | Production efficiency | Overall profitability |
| **Common margin benchmark (SaaS)** | 70-85% | 10-25% |
| **Sensitivity to scale** | Relatively stable | Highly sensitive to fixed costs |

## Understanding Profit Margins

Both metrics are commonly expressed as percentages relative to revenue, making it easier to compare companies of different sizes.

**Gross Profit Margin:**
> (Gross Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100

**Net Profit Margin:**
> (Net Profit ÷ Revenue) × 100

### Example Calculation

Consider a technology company with the following annual figures:

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Revenue | $10,000,000 |
| Cost of Goods Sold | $2,500,000 |
| Operating Expenses (R&D, Sales, G&A) | $5,000,000 |
| Interest Expense | $200,000 |
| Taxes | $500,000 |

**Gross Profit:** $10,000,000 − $2,500,000 = **$7,500,000**
**Gross Profit Margin:** ($7,500,000 ÷ $10,000,000) × 100 = **75%**

**Net Profit:** $10,000,000 − $2,500,000 − $5,000,000 − $200,000 − $500,000 = **$1,800,000**
**Net Profit Margin:** ($1,800,000 ÷ $10,000,000) × 100 = **18%**

## Why Technology Professionals Should Care

### Evaluating Company Health

When assessing potential employers or investment opportunities:

- **High gross margin + low net margin** suggests the company has a solid core product but heavy overhead (often seen in growth-stage startups investing heavily in sales and marketing)
- **High gross margin + high net margin** indicates an efficient, profitable business
- **Low gross margin** signals fundamental problems with the product economics—difficult to fix
- **Declining gross margin** may indicate increasing infrastructure costs, competitive pricing pressure, or vendor cost increases

### Strategic Decision-Making

Understanding these metrics helps you:

- Justify infrastructure investments by showing impact on gross margin
- Evaluate build-versus-buy decisions (third-party services directly affect COGS)
- Understand why your company prioritizes certain cost reductions
- Communicate with finance and executive teams using shared vocabulary

### Industry Benchmarks

Typical margins vary significantly by business model:

| Business Type | Typical Gross Margin | Typical Net Margin |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| SaaS Companies | 70-85% | 10-25% |
| E-commerce | 25-45% | 5-10% |
| Hardware Companies | 30-50% | 5-15% |
| Consulting/Services | 50-70% | 10-20% |
| Marketplaces | 60-80% | 15-30% |

## Common Expenses Between Gross and Net Profit

**Included in COGS (affects gross profit):**

- Hosting and cloud infrastructure
- Direct labor for production/delivery
- Third-party APIs and services integrated into the product
- Payment processing fees
- Customer success costs directly tied to service delivery

**Included in operating expenses (affects only net profit):**

- Research and development (engineering salaries)
- Sales and marketing
- General and administrative (HR, legal, finance, executive)
- Rent and facilities
- Depreciation and amortization
- Stock-based compensation
- Interest on debt
- Income taxes

## Limitations and Considerations

Both metrics have limitations technology professionals should recognize:

- **Non-cash expenses:** Depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation affect net profit but don't represent actual cash outflows
- **Growth-stage distortion:** High-growth companies often show poor net margins due to intentional investment in growth, not operational problems
- **GAAP vs. Non-GAAP:** Companies frequently report "adjusted" figures excluding certain expenses; always compare like-for-like
- **Classification inconsistency:** Different companies may classify the same expense as COGS or operating expense, making direct comparison difficult

## Summary

Gross profit measures how efficiently a company produces its core product by subtracting only direct costs from revenue. Net profit measures overall profitability by subtracting all expenses. For technology professionals, understanding both metrics provides essential insight into company financial health, informs strategic decisions about infrastructure and vendor choices, and enables meaningful communication with business stakeholders. A strong gross margin indicates sound product economics; a strong net margin indicates disciplined overall operations.
