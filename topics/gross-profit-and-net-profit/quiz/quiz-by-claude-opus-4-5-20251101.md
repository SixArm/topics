  <p>Gross profit subtracts only COGS from revenue, while net profit subtracts all expenses including operating costs and taxes</p>
  <p>Gross profit is calculated as revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS), which includes direct costs like raw materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Net profit goes further by subtracting all expenses from revenue, including COGS, operating expenses (rent, utilities, salaries), and taxes. Net profit represents the actual amount retained by the business after all obligations are met.</p>
