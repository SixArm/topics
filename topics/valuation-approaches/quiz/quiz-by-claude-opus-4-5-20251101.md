  <p>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model</p>
  <p>The DCF model is the fundamental approach that calculates the present value of expected future cash flows by discounting them back to today's value. It explicitly incorporates the time value of money (a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow) and adjusts for investment risk through the discount rate. While it requires significant assumptions, DCF is widely used by investors and analysts because it focuses on intrinsic value based on a company's actual cash-generating potential rather than market comparisons.</p>
