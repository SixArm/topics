  <p>BDUF completes detailed requirements and design specifications before coding begins</p>
  <p>Big Design Up Front (BDUF) is defined by its approach of completing detailed requirements, design documents, and specifications that outline the entire project before any coding begins. This contrasts with agile methodologies, which favor iterative approaches where design and development happen incrementally with ongoing feedback and adaptation.</p>
