# Use case diagram

Question: What is the primary difference between an "extend" relationship and an "include" relationship in a use case diagram?

- [ ] Extend uses a solid line while include uses a dashed line
- [ ] Include models optional functionality while extend models required functionality
- [ ] Extend models optional functionality that can be added to a base use case, while include models common functionality shared between use cases
- [ ] Extend connects actors to use cases while include connects use cases to the system boundary

  <p>Extend models optional functionality that can be added to a base use case, while include models common functionality shared between use cases</p>
  <p>In UML use case diagrams, the extend relationship is used for optional behavior that may or may not occur depending on certain conditions, whereas the include relationship represents mandatory, reusable functionality that is always executed as part of the base use case. Understanding this distinction is essential for correctly modeling system requirements and avoiding common diagram errors.</p>
