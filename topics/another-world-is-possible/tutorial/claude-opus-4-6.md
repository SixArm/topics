# Another World Is Possible

"Another World Is Possible: How to Reignite Social and Political Imagination" is a book by Geoff Mulgan, published in 2009. Mulgan, a prominent social thinker, entrepreneur, and policy advisor, argues that prevailing economic, political, and social models are insufficient for the complex challenges of modern life. For technology professionals, this book is particularly relevant because it frames innovation not merely as a technical endeavor but as a fundamentally social one. The ideas within directly inform how technologists design systems, build platforms, and shape the digital infrastructure that billions depend on daily.

## Who Is Geoff Mulgan

Geoff Mulgan is a British social innovator who has held leadership roles at the intersection of government, academia, and civil society. He served as Director of the UK Government's Strategy Unit under Prime Minister Tony Blair and later led Nesta, the UK's national foundation for innovation. His career spans decades of work on public policy, social enterprise, and systemic change. Mulgan's perspective is shaped by practical experience implementing large-scale initiatives, which gives his writing a grounded, pragmatic quality that distinguishes it from purely theoretical critiques of the status quo.

## Core Thesis

The central argument of the book is that societies have lost the capacity to imagine genuinely different futures. Political discourse has narrowed, economic thinking has calcified around market orthodoxies, and civic participation has declined. Mulgan contends that reigniting social and political imagination is not optional but essential for addressing the defining challenges of the era: inequality, environmental collapse, democratic disengagement, and social fragmentation.

He does not argue for utopian thinking in the naive sense. Instead, he advocates for disciplined imagination grounded in evidence, experimentation, and collective action. The book positions creativity and innovation as civic responsibilities, not just commercial opportunities.

## Key Themes

The book covers a broad set of interconnected themes. The following table outlines the major areas and their relevance to technology professionals.

| Theme | Description | Relevance to Technology |
|---|---|---|
| Economic inequality | Existing economic systems concentrate wealth and opportunity, leaving large populations underserved | Platform design, algorithmic fairness, and access to digital services directly shape economic outcomes |
| Environmental degradation | Industrial models externalize environmental costs, threatening planetary sustainability | Green computing, sustainable infrastructure, and lifecycle-aware engineering are growing imperatives |
| Political disengagement | Citizens feel disconnected from governance, reducing democratic accountability | Civic technology, open data, and digital public goods can rebuild trust and participation |
| Social fragmentation | Communities are increasingly atomized, weakening collective problem-solving capacity | Social platforms, communication tools, and collaboration software shape how communities form and function |
| Innovation as social practice | Innovation must extend beyond commercial product development to address systemic challenges | Technologists have the skills and infrastructure to drive social innovation at scale |

## Reigniting Imagination

Mulgan identifies several mechanisms for restoring the capacity for collective imagination:

- **Learning from history**: Past social movements, from labor rights to environmental activism, demonstrate that large-scale transformation is achievable when people organize around shared visions.
- **Cross-sector collaboration**: Meaningful change requires partnerships across government, business, civil society, and academia. No single sector holds all the answers.
- **Experimentation and prototyping**: Rather than designing comprehensive blueprints, Mulgan advocates for iterative experimentation, testing ideas at small scale before expanding them.
- **Narrative and storytelling**: Compelling visions of the future require narratives that people can connect with emotionally and intellectually, not just policy papers and data.
- **Citizen participation**: Active citizenship, including direct involvement in governance, community organizing, and civic technology, is essential for democratic renewal.

## Implications for Technology Professionals

Technology professionals occupy a unique position in this landscape. The systems they build mediate nearly every aspect of modern life, from commerce and communication to healthcare and governance. This creates both responsibility and opportunity.

| Area of Practice | Conventional Approach | Mulgan-Informed Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Product development | Optimize for engagement, revenue, and growth metrics | Consider social outcomes, equity of access, and long-term sustainability alongside business metrics |
| Platform governance | Minimize moderation costs; defer to market dynamics | Design governance structures that empower users and communities to shape platform rules |
| Data practices | Extract maximum value from user data for commercial purposes | Treat data stewardship as a civic responsibility; explore data trusts and cooperative models |
| Open source and public goods | Contribute when strategically advantageous | Invest in digital public infrastructure as a matter of principle, recognizing its role in reducing inequality |
| Hiring and team composition | Optimize for technical skill and cultural fit | Build diverse teams that reflect the communities served, bringing broader perspectives to design decisions |

The book challenges technologists to move beyond the assumption that technological progress automatically produces social progress. History demonstrates that technology amplifies existing power structures unless deliberately designed to do otherwise.

## Creativity, Innovation, and Collective Action

Mulgan draws on case studies from around the world to show how individuals and communities have driven meaningful transformation. These examples share common characteristics:

- They start with a clear diagnosis of a problem, grounded in lived experience rather than abstract theory.
- They involve diverse coalitions rather than isolated actors.
- They iterate rapidly, learning from failure rather than attempting to plan exhaustively in advance.
- They build institutional capacity so that gains are sustained beyond the initial burst of energy.
- They challenge incumbent assumptions about what is possible or practical.

For technology organizations, this maps directly onto practices like design thinking, lean methodology, and open innovation. The difference is in scope and intent: Mulgan asks practitioners to apply these methods not just to product-market fit but to systemic social challenges.

## Questioning Prevailing Assumptions

One of the book's most valuable contributions is its insistence on questioning assumptions that are often taken for granted in professional and policy environments:

- **Growth as the primary metric of success**: Mulgan challenges the assumption that GDP growth or company revenue growth is inherently desirable, asking instead what kinds of growth serve human well-being.
- **Market efficiency as default governance**: He questions the belief that markets, left to their own devices, produce optimal outcomes, pointing to systemic failures in housing, healthcare, and environmental protection.
- **Technological determinism**: The book pushes back against the idea that technology follows an inevitable trajectory, arguing that societies choose which technologies to develop, deploy, and regulate.
- **Individualism as the foundation of progress**: Mulgan emphasizes collective action, mutual aid, and shared governance as essential complements to individual initiative.

## New Models of Governance and Social Innovation

The book advocates for governance models that are more participatory, adaptive, and transparent. These include:

- **Deliberative democracy**: Structured processes for citizen engagement in policy decisions, such as citizens' assemblies and participatory budgeting.
- **Social enterprises**: Organizations that blend commercial sustainability with explicit social missions, reinvesting profits into community benefit.
- **Collaborative platforms**: Digital infrastructure that enables collective action, from cooperative ownership models to open-source public services.
- **Adaptive regulation**: Regulatory frameworks that evolve in response to new evidence and changing conditions, rather than remaining static.

Technology professionals are increasingly central to implementing these models. Civic technology, govtech, and social enterprise software are growing fields that directly apply engineering skills to the challenges Mulgan describes.

Readers interested in these ideas should explore related topics including social innovation, design thinking, civic technology, open-source software, digital public goods, platform cooperativism, participatory design, ethical technology, corporate social responsibility, and systems thinking. Books such as "Inspired" by Marty Cagan, "The Design of Everyday Things" by Donald Norman, and "Crossing the Chasm" by Geoffrey Moore complement Mulgan's perspective by addressing how products and ideas move from vision to widespread adoption.

## Summary

"Another World Is Possible" by Geoff Mulgan is a call to restore the capacity for social and political imagination in an era of narrowing discourse and mounting systemic challenges. For technology professionals, the book provides a framework for understanding their work not just as commercial activity but as a form of civic infrastructure. By questioning prevailing assumptions, embracing experimentation, fostering cross-sector collaboration, and designing for equity and sustainability, technologists can contribute to building alternative futures that prioritize human well-being alongside economic viability.
