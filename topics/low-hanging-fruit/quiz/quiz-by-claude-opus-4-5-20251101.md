  <p>They should not be the sole focus and must align with overall strategy</p>
  <p>While low-hanging fruit provides quick wins with minimal effort, technology professionals must balance these opportunities with other important tasks and goals. It is critical to evaluate the long-term impact of low-hanging fruit initiatives and ensure they align with the organization's overall strategy, rather than pursuing easy wins at the expense of more significant objectives.</p>
