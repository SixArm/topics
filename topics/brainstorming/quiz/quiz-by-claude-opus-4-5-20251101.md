  <p>Suspend judgment and criticism to generate as many ideas as possible</p>
  <p>The core principle of brainstorming is to create a non-judgmental atmosphere where participants can freely generate many ideas without immediate evaluation. This "quantity over quality" approach, combined with suspending criticism, encourages unconventional thinking and allows wild ideas to emerge that may lead to innovative solutions. Evaluation happens after the brainstorming phase, not during it.</p>
