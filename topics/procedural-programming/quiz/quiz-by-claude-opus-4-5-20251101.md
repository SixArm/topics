# Procedural programming

Question: What is the primary organizing principle of procedural programming?

- [ ] Organizing code around objects that encapsulate data and behavior
- [ ] Organizing code around a sequence of procedures or subroutines executed in a specific order
- [ ] Organizing code around mathematical functions that avoid mutable state
- [ ] Organizing code around events and asynchronous message passing

  <p>Organizing code around a sequence of procedures or subroutines executed in a specific order</p>
  <p>Procedural programming (PP) is a paradigm where the program is designed and structured around a sequence of procedures or subroutines that are executed in a specific order. These procedures, often called functions or methods, are grouped by functionality and operate on variables that can be passed between them as arguments. This approach is distinct from object-oriented programming (which organizes around objects), functional programming (which emphasizes immutable state and mathematical functions), and event-driven programming (which responds to events).</p>
