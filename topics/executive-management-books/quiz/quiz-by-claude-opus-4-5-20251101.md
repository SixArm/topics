  <p>Autonomy, mastery, and purpose</p>
  <p>In "Drive", Daniel Pink challenges traditional views on motivation and argues that people are motivated by more than just financial incentives. His research shows that intrinsic motivation comes from autonomy (the desire to direct our own lives), mastery (the urge to get better at something that matters), and purpose (the yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves). This framework is particularly valuable for technology professionals designing team structures, incentive systems, and work environments.</p>
