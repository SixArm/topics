  <p>Setting unrealistic stretch goals can lead to demotivation, frustration, and burnout</p>
  <p>While stretch goals are designed to be challenging and push individuals or teams beyond their comfort zones, they must be properly managed. If goals are unrealistic or unattainable, the intended motivational effect backfires, causing demotivation, frustration, and burnout. Effective stretch goals strike a balance between being challenging enough to inspire higher performance while remaining achievable and realistic.</p>
