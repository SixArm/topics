  <p>They can analyze cultural nuances, user behavior, and language to adapt content for different markets</p>
  <p>AI enhances internationalization/localization by combining multiple capabilities: language translation, natural language processing, content adaptation based on cultural preferences, voice recognition for different accents, and user behavior analysis. This holistic approach allows products and services to be effectively adapted across languages, cultures, and regions—going beyond simple translation to address cultural sensitivity and regional preferences.</p>
