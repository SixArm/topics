  <p>Perceivability, Operability, Understandability, Robustness</p>
  <p>These four principles form the foundation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Perceivability ensures information can be perceived through multiple senses. Operability ensures interfaces work with different input methods like keyboards and assistive technologies. Understandability ensures content is clear and logical. Robustness ensures compatibility across a wide range of assistive technologies and platforms.</p>
