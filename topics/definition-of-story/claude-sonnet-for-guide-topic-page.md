# Definition of Story (DoS)

In agile software engineering, a story, also known as a user story, is a concise, informal description of a software capability written from the perspective of an end user. A story focuses on the value delivered to users rather than technical specifications, emphasizing what the user wants to accomplish and why it matters to them.

A well-crafted user story typically follows the format: "I am a [type of user]. I want [some goal] so that [some reason]." This structure ensures that the story identifies the user, defines the desired functionality, and explains the business value or benefit. Stories are intentionally brief and serve as conversation starters for collaboration between development teams, product owners, and stakeholders.

The story format promotes customer collaboration and responds to changing requirements, two core principles of agile methodology. By focusing on user needs and outcomes rather than technical implementation details, stories help teams maintain alignment with business objectives while enabling iterative development and continuous feedback.

Stories should be testable, estimable, and ideally independent of other stories, allowing for flexible prioritization and delivery. Each story includes acceptance criteria that define the conditions for the story to be considered complete. This provides clear guidelines for both development and testing.
