  <p>Culture fit relates to work style and organizational norms, while values alignment relates to personal beliefs and organizational principles</p>
  <p>Culture fit refers to how well an individual's work style, communication approach, and attitudes align with the norms of an organization (such as pace, decision-making processes, and social dynamics). Values alignment refers to how well an individual's personal values and beliefs align with the organization's principles (such as integrity, social responsibility, and ethical practices). Both are important but distinct considerations—a person may fit the culture but not share the values, or vice versa, which can affect long-term success and satisfaction.</p>
