# Moore's Law

Question: According to Moore's Law, what happens to the number of transistors on an integrated circuit approximately every two years?

- [ ] It increases by 50%
- [ ] It doubles
- [ ] It triples
- [ ] It remains constant while efficiency improves

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>It doubles</p>
  <p>Moore's Law, predicted by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965, states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years while the cost per transistor decreases. This observation has driven exponential growth in computing power and has been remarkably accurate for decades, serving as a cornerstone principle guiding the semiconductor industry's development roadmap.</p>
