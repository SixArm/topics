  <p>A period of slow or flat growth followed by sudden rapid acceleration</p>
  <p>Hockey-stick growth describes a growth curve that resembles the shape of a hockey stick—a relatively flat or slow-growing period during a company's early stages, followed by a dramatic upward acceleration in revenue or user base. This pattern is particularly associated with startups and emerging companies that achieve market traction after initial development phases.</p>
