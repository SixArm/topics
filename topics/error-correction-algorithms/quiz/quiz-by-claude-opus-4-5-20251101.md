# Error correction algorithms

Question: What is the primary capability that distinguishes Reed-Solomon codes from Hamming codes?

- [ ] Reed-Solomon codes can only detect errors but cannot correct them
- [ ] Reed-Solomon codes work only with analog signals
- [ ] Reed-Solomon codes can correct multiple errors in a block of data
- [ ] Reed-Solomon codes require less redundancy than Hamming codes

  <p>Reed-Solomon codes can correct multiple errors in a block of data</p>
  <p>While Hamming codes are designed to correct single-bit errors and detect two-bit errors, Reed-Solomon codes are more powerful and can correct multiple errors within a data block. This makes Reed-Solomon codes widely used in data storage systems (like CDs, DVDs, and QR codes) and digital communication systems where burst errors affecting multiple consecutive bits are common.</p>
