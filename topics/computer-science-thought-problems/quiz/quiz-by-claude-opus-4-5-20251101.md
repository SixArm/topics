  <p>The Dining Philosophers Problem</p>
  <p>The Dining Philosophers Problem directly models concurrent resource sharing, where philosophers (processes) compete for shared chopsticks (resources). It illustrates how improper resource allocation can lead to deadlock, where all processes are waiting indefinitely for resources held by others. This makes it fundamental for understanding synchronization, mutual exclusion, and deadlock prevention strategies in operating systems and concurrent programming.</p>
