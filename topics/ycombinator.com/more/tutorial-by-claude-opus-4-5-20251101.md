# Y Combinator (YC): A Comprehensive Tutorial

## Introduction

Y Combinator (YC) is the world's most influential startup accelerator, having helped launch companies now worth over $600 billion combined. Founded in March 2005 by Paul Graham, Robert Morris, Trevor Blackwell, and Jessica Livingston, YC pioneered the modern accelerator model that has since been replicated worldwide. For technology professionals considering entrepreneurship, understanding YC's approach, investment terms, and ecosystem is essential knowledge.

## What Y Combinator Does

Y Combinator provides early-stage startups with a comprehensive package designed to accelerate growth:

- **Seed funding** - Standard $500,000 investment ($125,000 on standard terms plus $375,000 on an uncapped SAFE with MFN)
- **Three-month intensive program** - Twice yearly batches (Winter and Summer) based in San Francisco
- **Mentorship and office hours** - Regular meetings with YC partners who are experienced founders and operators
- **Demo Day access** - Presentation opportunity to hundreds of top investors
- **Lifetime alumni network** - Access to the YC founder community of 10,000+ alumni

## The YC Program Structure

The program runs for approximately three months and follows a structured format:

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Kickoff | Week 1 | Orientation, partner introductions, goal setting |
| Build Phase | Weeks 2-10 | Weekly group office hours, product development, customer acquisition |
| Demo Day Prep | Weeks 10-12 | Pitch refinement, investor strategy, presentation practice |
| Demo Day | Final week | Pitch to 500+ investors in a single event |

## Investment Terms

YC's investment structure has evolved over the years. The current standard deal includes:

- **$125,000 investment** for 7% equity on a post-money SAFE
- **$375,000 investment** on an uncapped SAFE with Most Favored Nation (MFN) provisions
- **Pro-rata rights** allowing YC to maintain ownership percentage in future rounds

This means YC invests $500,000 total in each company, with the equity percentage determined by subsequent funding rounds for the MFN portion.

## YC's Extended Ecosystem

Beyond the core accelerator, YC has built a broader ecosystem:

### Startup School
A free online program offering courses, resources, and community for founders who haven't yet joined YC. Covers fundamentals of starting a company, from ideation to fundraising.

### YC Research
A non-profit research lab that has explored universal basic income, AI safety, and other societal questions. Notable projects included OpenAI (before it became independent) and the UBI study in Kenya.

### Continuity Fund
YC's growth-stage fund that invests in successful YC alumni companies during Series B and beyond, allowing YC to maintain meaningful ownership in breakout companies.

### Hacker News
A technology-focused news aggregation site run by YC, serving as a community hub for founders, engineers, and tech enthusiasts.

## The Application Process

YC accepts applications through an online form, with key evaluation criteria:

- **Team quality** - Technical ability, domain expertise, and founder-market fit
- **Idea potential** - Large market opportunity and defensible positioning
- **Traction** - Evidence of product-market fit, even if early
- **Progress velocity** - Rate of improvement and execution capability

The acceptance rate is approximately 1-2%, with thousands of applications per batch. Successful applicants receive an interview invitation before final decisions.

## What YC Looks For

Based on public statements from YC partners, the program prioritizes:

| Factor | Weight | What They Evaluate |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Founders | Highest | Determination, intelligence, domain expertise |
| Market | High | Size, growth rate, timing |
| Traction | Medium | Users, revenue, growth rate |
| Idea | Medium | Clarity, defensibility, uniqueness |

YC has stated they would rather fund a strong team with a mediocre idea than a mediocre team with a strong idea, as strong teams tend to find their way to good ideas.

## The YC Philosophy

Several core principles define YC's approach:

- **Make something people want** - YC's unofficial motto emphasizes product-market fit above all else
- **Talk to users** - Direct customer interaction is prioritized over assumptions
- **Launch fast** - Getting real feedback quickly beats extended development cycles
- **Do things that don't scale** - Manual, unscalable tactics are encouraged early on
- **Focus on growth** - Weekly growth metrics (typically 5-7% week-over-week) are the primary measure of progress

## Comparison with Other Accelerators

| Factor | Y Combinator | Techstars | 500 Startups |
|--------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
