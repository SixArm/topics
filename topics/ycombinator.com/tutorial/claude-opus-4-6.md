# Y Combinator (YC)

Y Combinator (YC) is the world's most influential startup accelerator, providing seed funding, mentorship, and operational resources to early-stage technology companies. Founded in March 2005 by Paul Graham, Robert Morris, Trevor Blackwell, and Jessica Livingston, YC has fundamentally reshaped how startups are built, funded, and scaled. The program operates on a batch model, accepting cohorts of startups twice per year, and has become the gold standard against which all other accelerator programs are measured. Its alumni network includes some of the most valuable private and public technology companies in history, and its combined portfolio valuation exceeds $600 billion.

## History and Founding

Paul Graham, a programmer, essayist, and co-founder of Viaweb (acquired by Yahoo), conceived Y Combinator as an experiment in startup funding. Alongside his wife Jessica Livingston, an investment banker turned startup advocate, and fellow MIT alumni Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell, Graham launched the first YC batch in Cambridge, Massachusetts during the summer of 2005. The program soon relocated to Mountain View, California, and later to San Francisco. Sam Altman succeeded Paul Graham as president in 2014, scaling the program significantly before departing in 2019 to lead OpenAI. Garry Tan, a YC alumnus and partner, became president and CEO in 2023, bringing the organization into its current era with a renewed focus on technical founders and frontier technology.

## How the Program Works

The YC accelerator program runs for approximately three months, during which founders receive intensive mentorship, participate in weekly group office hours, and refine their product, go-to-market strategy, and fundraising approach. The program culminates in Demo Day, a high-profile event where each startup presents to a curated audience of hundreds of investors, press, and industry leaders.

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Batch Cycle | Two batches per year (Winter and Summer) |
| Duration | Approximately 3 months |
| Standard Investment | $500,000 (as of 2022 terms) |
| Equity Taken | 7% via standard deal (subject to revision) |
| Application | Online application reviewed by YC partners |
| Interview | 10-minute in-person or video interview |
| Demo Day | End-of-batch investor presentation event |
| Location | San Francisco, with remote participation options |

## Investment Terms

YC's deal structure has evolved over time to remain competitive and founder-friendly. As of 2022, YC invests $500,000 in each company through two instruments: a $125,000 investment on a standard post-money SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) in exchange for 7% equity, plus an additional $375,000 on an uncapped SAFE with a Most Favored Nation provision. This structure gives founders meaningful capital to operate during and after the program without requiring a formal valuation at the earliest stage.

## YC Startup School

Beyond the core accelerator, Y Combinator operates Startup School, a free online program open to founders worldwide. Startup School provides:

- Structured curriculum covering product development, growth, fundraising, and hiring
- Weekly group sessions with other founders for accountability and peer feedback
- Access to recorded lectures and essays from YC partners and successful alumni
- Perks and discounts on cloud services, legal tools, and other startup infrastructure
- A global community forum for networking and knowledge sharing

Startup School has served hundreds of thousands of founders across nearly every country, democratizing access to the kind of practical startup education that was previously available only to a select few.

## Key Philosophies and Principles

Y Combinator's culture and advice to founders are rooted in several core principles that have become widely influential in the startup ecosystem:

- **Make something people want.** This is YC's motto and the foundational filter for evaluating startup ideas. Product-market fit is the single most important objective for any early-stage company.
- **Talk to users.** Founders are expected to engage directly and frequently with customers to validate assumptions, discover pain points, and iterate on their product.
- **Launch early.** YC discourages perfectionism. Shipping a minimum viable product quickly and learning from real-world feedback is prioritized over building in isolation.
- **Do things that don't scale.** In the early days, founders should perform manual, unscalable work to deeply understand their users and market before optimizing for efficiency.
- **Focus on growth.** A startup is defined by its growth rate. YC encourages founders to identify and relentlessly pursue their primary growth metric week over week.
- **Default alive or default dead.** Founders must honestly assess whether their company will reach profitability or the next funding milestone given current trajectory, and adjust accordingly.

## YC's Broader Ecosystem

Y Combinator has built a substantial ecosystem of programs and resources that extend well beyond the accelerator itself:

- **Bookface:** A private social network exclusively for YC alumni, facilitating introductions, deal flow, hiring, and knowledge exchange across the entire alumni base.
- **YC Continuity Fund:** A growth-stage venture fund that invests in YC alumni companies at Series B and beyond, allowing YC to maintain its relationship and support through later stages of growth.
- **Work at a Startup:** A jobs platform connecting YC portfolio companies with engineering, product, and operations talent.
- **Requests for Startups (RFS):** Periodically published lists of problem areas and industries where YC sees significant opportunity, guiding prospective applicants toward high-impact ideas.
- **Hacker News:** A technology-focused news aggregation and discussion forum operated by YC, widely read by developers, founders, and investors.

## Strengths and Criticisms

| Strengths | Criticisms |
|---|---|
| Unmatched alumni network and brand prestige | Highly competitive acceptance rate (under 2%) |
| Proven track record of producing billion-dollar companies | Standardized deal may not suit all company stages |
| Demo Day provides concentrated investor access | Batch model creates intense pressure and time constraints |
| Strong post-program support via Continuity Fund and Bookface | Concentration in Silicon Valley culture and norms |
| Free educational resources through Startup School | Some critics argue YC creates pattern-matching bias in venture capital |
| Founder-friendly investment terms | Rapid scaling emphasis may not fit every business model |
