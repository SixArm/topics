# Consensus algorithms

Question: What is the primary purpose of consensus algorithms in distributed systems?

- [ ] To optimize network bandwidth usage across nodes
- [ ] To encrypt communications between nodes in a network
- [ ] To enable multiple nodes to agree on a single value or state, even in the presence of faulty or malicious actors
- [ ] To maximize transaction throughput by parallelizing operations

  <p>To enable multiple nodes to agree on a single value or state, even in the presence of faulty or malicious actors</p>
  <p>Consensus algorithms are designed to ensure that all nodes in a distributed system converge to the same decision or state. This is critical for maintaining consistency across decentralized systems like blockchain, where nodes must agree on the validity of transactions and the current state of the ledger, even when some nodes may be faulty or deliberately malicious.</p>
