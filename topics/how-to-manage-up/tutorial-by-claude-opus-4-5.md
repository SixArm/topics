# How to Manage Up: Tutorial

## Overview

Managing up is the practice of proactively building a strong, productive working relationship with your supervisor or manager. It is not about manipulation or flattery -- it is about understanding your manager's goals, communication style, and constraints, and then aligning your work and interactions to create mutual success. For agile change technology professionals, managing up effectively can unlock resources, remove blockers, accelerate career growth, and ensure that your team's work is visible and valued. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to the principles and practices of managing up.

## Key Concepts

### Adapt Your Style

Every manager has a preferred communication style, decision-making process, and set of priorities. Some managers want detailed written reports; others prefer brief verbal updates. Some make decisions quickly; others need time to deliberate. Your job is to learn your manager's preferences and adapt your approach accordingly.

Observe how your manager communicates, what questions they ask, what information they prioritize, and how they respond to different situations. Then adjust your interactions to match their style.

### Build Trust

Trust is the currency of the managing-up relationship. Build it by:

- Delivering quality work consistently.
- Being reliable and following through on commitments.
- Communicating honestly, including when things are not going well.
- Demonstrating a proactive, collaborative attitude.
- Respecting confidentiality and discretion.

### Communicate Clearly

Keep your manager informed about your work progress, challenges, and any support you need. Do not wait for them to ask -- proactively share updates at a frequency and in a format that matches their preferences.

When raising issues, pair them with potential solutions. Managers appreciate team members who bring options rather than just problems.

### Align with Goals

Understand your manager's goals and the organization's priorities. Align your work and objectives with those goals. This demonstrates that you are not just focused on your own tasks but are contributing to the broader mission.

When proposing new initiatives or changes, frame them in terms of how they support organizational objectives.

### Anticipate Needs

Stay aware of upcoming projects, deadlines, and potential challenges. Take initiative to offer assistance, suggest solutions, or provide relevant information before being asked. Anticipating your manager's needs demonstrates strategic thinking and reliability.

### Seek Feedback

Regularly request feedback on your performance, strengths, and areas for improvement. Act on the feedback you receive. This shows that you are committed to growth and open to input.

### Manage Expectations

Clarify expectations about deliverables, deadlines, and quality standards. If constraints arise that affect your ability to meet expectations, communicate them early and propose alternatives.

### Be Solutions-Oriented

When presenting challenges, come prepared with potential solutions or options. This shifts the conversation from "Here is a problem" to "Here is a problem and here is how we might solve it." Managers value team members who are proactive problem-solvers.

### Foster Collaboration

Build strong relationships with your colleagues. Seek opportunities to work together across teams. When your manager sees that you are a collaborative team player who lifts others up, it strengthens their confidence in you.

### Continuously Develop

Take ownership of your professional growth. Pursue learning opportunities, develop new skills, and stay current with industry trends. Share what you learn with your manager and team. Continuous development makes you more valuable and demonstrates initiative.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Schedule regular one-on-ones.** If your manager does not already have regular check-ins with you, propose them. Use these meetings to share updates, discuss priorities, seek feedback, and address any concerns.

2. **Prepare for every interaction.** Before meetings with your manager, prepare an agenda or a list of topics. Come with updates, questions, and proposed solutions. Respect their time by being concise and focused.

3. **Learn their priorities.** Ask your manager directly: What are your top priorities this quarter? What keeps you up at night? Use their answers to align your work and communication.

4. **Proactively share good news and bad news.** Do not let your manager be surprised -- especially by bad news. If a project is at risk, raise it early along with your mitigation plan.

5. **Document your achievements.** Keep a running record of your accomplishments, contributions, and impact. This makes performance reviews easier and ensures your work is recognized.

6. **Offer to take things off their plate.** If you see your manager overwhelmed, offer to handle a task, lead a meeting, or draft a communication. This builds trust and demonstrates leadership.

7. **Adapt when managers change.** If you get a new manager, invest time upfront in understanding their style, priorities, and expectations. The transition period is critical for establishing a strong relationship.

8. **Practice empathy.** Remember that your manager has their own pressures, constraints, and challenges. Approach the relationship with empathy and a genuine desire to create mutual success.

## Key Takeaway

Managing up is a proactive, strategic skill that benefits both you and your manager. It is about building a relationship based on trust, clear communication, and mutual support. Agile change technology professionals who manage up effectively gain greater influence, better alignment with organizational goals, faster career advancement, and stronger working relationships. The key is to understand your manager's world, adapt your approach, communicate proactively, and consistently deliver value. Managing up is not about impressing your boss -- it is about creating the conditions for shared success.
