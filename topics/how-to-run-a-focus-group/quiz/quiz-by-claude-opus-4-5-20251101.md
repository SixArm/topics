  <p>To ensure key topics are covered while allowing flexibility for exploration</p>
  <p>A structured discussion guide outlines the key topics, questions, or activities you want to cover during the focus group. It uses a logical flow to keep the session organized and productive, while still allowing flexibility to explore unexpected insights or topics that emerge during the discussion. This balance between structure and adaptability is essential for gathering meaningful qualitative data.</p>
