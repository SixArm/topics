  <p>Autonomy, purpose, and mastery</p>
  <p>Intrinsic motivation is driven by autonomy (the ability to act independently), purpose (feeling that efforts matter), and mastery (gaining satisfaction from becoming more skilled). Agile frameworks support these by empowering teams to make decisions, maintaining direct connections to end users through customer collaboration, and encouraging continuous improvement through feedback and reflection.</p>
