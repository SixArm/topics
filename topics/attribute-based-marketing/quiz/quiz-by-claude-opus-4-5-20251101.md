  <p>To build strong, long-term relationships with a smaller number of high-value accounts</p>
  <p>ABM focuses on identifying high-value customers or accounts and creating personalized messaging and campaigns to engage them. The approach is based on the premise that a smaller number of highly engaged customers are more valuable than a larger number of passive customers, making relationship-building with key accounts the central objective.</p>
