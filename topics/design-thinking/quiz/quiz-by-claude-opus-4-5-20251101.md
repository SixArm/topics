  <p>Empathizing with the end-user to understand their needs, desires, and pain points</p>
  <p>Design thinking is fundamentally a human-centered approach that begins with empathy. The first stage explicitly involves understanding the user's perspective through research, interviews, and observation. This user focus carries through all five stages (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test), ensuring solutions are built around actual user needs rather than assumptions or purely technical considerations.</p>
