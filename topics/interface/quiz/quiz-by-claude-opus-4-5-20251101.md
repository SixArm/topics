# Interface

Question: What is the primary purpose of an interface in programming?

- [ ] To provide concrete method implementations that classes can inherit directly
- [ ] To define a contract specifying behaviors that implementing classes must provide
- [ ] To allow classes to share private data and internal state
- [ ] To replace the need for abstract classes entirely in object-oriented design

  <p>To define a contract specifying behaviors that implementing classes must provide</p>
  <p>An interface defines a contract that specifies what a class or object should do (its behavior) without dictating how it should do it. Interfaces contain method signatures but not method bodies, requiring implementing classes to supply their own concrete implementations. This promotes abstraction, polymorphism, code modularity, and separation of concerns.</p>
