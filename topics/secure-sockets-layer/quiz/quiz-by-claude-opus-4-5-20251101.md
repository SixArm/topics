# Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

Question: What is the primary purpose of the SSL handshake process between a client and server?

- [ ] To verify the user's login credentials before granting access
- [ ] To compress data for faster transmission over the network
- [ ] To agree on encryption algorithms and exchange encryption keys
- [ ] To establish the physical connection between network devices

  <p>To agree on encryption algorithms and exchange encryption keys</p>
  <p>During the SSL handshake, the client and server negotiate which encryption algorithms to use and exchange the cryptographic keys necessary to establish a secure, encrypted channel. This process is foundational to SSL/TLS security, as it ensures both parties can communicate using mutually agreed-upon encryption methods before any sensitive data is transmitted.</p>
