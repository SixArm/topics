  <p>A product roadmap is a high-level strategic plan that outlines a company's product development goals and how they will be achieved over time. It serves as a guide for product managers and executives, allowing them to make informed decisions and communicate the product vision to stakeholders. Unlike detailed technical specifications or bug tracking systems, the roadmap focuses on objectives, themes, initiatives, and timelines to align the entire organization around the product vision.</p>
