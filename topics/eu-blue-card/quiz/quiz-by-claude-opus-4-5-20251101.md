  <p>To allow highly skilled non-EU citizens to live and work in participating EU member states</p>
  <p>The EU Blue Card is specifically designed as a residence and work permit for highly skilled non-European Union citizens. It aims to attract and retain qualified professionals from around the world to contribute to the economic growth and competitiveness of the European Union. Unlike a tourist visa, it provides the right to live and work in the issuing member state, along with benefits such as bringing family members, accessing social services, and job mobility within participating EU countries.</p>
