  <p>To help users understand their current location within a site hierarchy and provide a trail to retrace their steps</p>
  <p>Breadcrumbs are a navigational element that shows users where they are within a website or application's hierarchical structure. Named after the fairy tale "Hansel and Gretel," they display the path users have taken, allowing them to quickly orient themselves and navigate back to higher-level pages. This reduces cognitive load and improves user experience by providing context, control, and easy access to parent pages.</p>
