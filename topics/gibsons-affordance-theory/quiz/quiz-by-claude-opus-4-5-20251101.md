  <p>Affordances are the perceived possibilities for action that an environment or object offers to an individual</p>
  <p>Gibson's affordance theory explains that affordances are opportunities for action directly perceived in the environment. For technology professionals, this means designing interfaces where interactive elements naturally communicate their functionality—a button should look clickable, a slider should look draggable. This direct perception approach eliminates the need for users to rely on complex reasoning or extensive training to understand how to interact with a system.</p>
