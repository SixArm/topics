  <p>To clearly indicate what operation or action the function performs</p>
  <p>Using action verbs at the beginning of function names (such as "saveData," "generateReport," or "validateInput") provides an immediate indication of what the function does. This makes code more self-documenting and easier to understand, reducing the need for extensive comments and helping developers quickly grasp the function's purpose when reading or maintaining the codebase.</p>
