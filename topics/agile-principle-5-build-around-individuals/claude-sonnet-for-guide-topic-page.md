# Agile principle 5: Build around individuals

"Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."

The principle of building projects around motivated individuals is fundamental to successful agile software development. This approach recognizes that skilled, passionate developers produce better results when given autonomy and proper support rather than micromanagement.

The key to implementing this principle lies in careful hiring for intrinsic motivation, providing necessary resources like modern development tools and continuous learning opportunities, and establishing clear communication channels for support. Leaders must resist the urge to control every detail and instead focus on removing obstacles and providing context. When teams feel trusted and supported, they naturally take ownership of their work, leading to higher quality software, faster delivery, and greater innovation. This approach transforms traditional manager-subordinate relationships into collaborative partnerships focused on shared success.

Spotify exemplifies this principle through its squad model, where small, cross-functional teams operate with significant autonomy. Each squad has the freedom to choose their own tools, processes, and even architecture decisions within broader company guidelines. This trust-based approach has enabled Spotify to scale rapidly while maintaining innovation and quality.

Google's "20% time" policy demonstrates another application of this principle. Engineers are encouraged to spend one day per week on projects they're passionate about, leading to breakthrough innovations like Gmail and Google Maps. By trusting motivated individuals to pursue their interests, Google has consistently delivered game-changing products.

Netflix takes this further by eliminating traditional vacation policies and expense approval processes for their engineering teams. They provide high-compensation, cutting-edge tools, and clear objectives, then trust their motivated engineers to deliver results. This environment of trust and support has helped Netflix maintain its position as a technology leader in streaming services.
