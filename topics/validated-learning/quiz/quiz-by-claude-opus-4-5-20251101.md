  <p>To reduce risk by testing assumptions with empirical evidence from real users</p>
  <p>Validated learning emphasizes testing hypotheses early and often using actual customer feedback rather than relying on assumptions or guesswork. By creating a minimum viable product (MVP) and gathering data from early adopters, startups can make informed decisions and reduce the uncertainty associated with launching new products or services.</p>
