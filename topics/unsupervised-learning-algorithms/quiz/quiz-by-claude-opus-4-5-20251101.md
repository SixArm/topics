# Unsupervised learning algorithms

Question: What is the defining characteristic of unsupervised learning algorithms compared to supervised learning?

- [ ] They require large amounts of labeled training data
- [ ] They discover patterns and structures without explicit target labels or correct outputs
- [ ] They always produce more accurate results than supervised methods
- [ ] They can only be used for image classification tasks

  <p>They discover patterns and structures without explicit target labels or correct outputs</p>
  <p>Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover patterns, structures, or representations in data without any explicit guidance such as target labels or correct outputs. This distinguishes them from supervised learning, which requires labeled data to train models. Examples include clustering algorithms like K-means, dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, and anomaly detection methods like Isolation Forest.</p>
