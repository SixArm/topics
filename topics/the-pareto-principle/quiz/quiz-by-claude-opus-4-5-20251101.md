  <p>Focus on the 20% of activities likely to produce 80% of the results</p>
  <p>The Pareto Principle suggests that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. For technology professionals, this means identifying and prioritizing the small subset of tasks, features, or bug fixes that will deliver the greatest impact—whether in productivity, revenue, or user satisfaction—rather than spreading effort evenly across all work items.</p>
