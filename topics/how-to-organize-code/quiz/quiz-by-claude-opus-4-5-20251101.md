  <p>To make code easier to understand, test, and maintain</p>
  <p>Modular design is a fundamental principle of code organization. By breaking code into smaller, self-contained modules where each has a clear specific responsibility, developers can more easily understand what each piece does, write targeted tests for individual components, and maintain the codebase over time without unintended side effects.</p>
