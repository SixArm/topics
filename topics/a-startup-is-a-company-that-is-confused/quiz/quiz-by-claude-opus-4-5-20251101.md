  <p>What its product is, who its customers are, and how to make money</p>
  <p>Dave McClure, co-founder of 500 Startups, stated that "A startup is a company that is confused about 1. What its product is. 2. Who its customers are. 3. How to make money." This quotation captures the core uncertainties that startups face in their early stages: defining a clear product offering, identifying the target customer segments willing to pay, and establishing a viable revenue model. These three challenges require significant experimentation and iteration to achieve product-market fit.</p>
