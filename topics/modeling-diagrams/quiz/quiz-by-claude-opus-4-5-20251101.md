  <p>Sequence Diagram</p>
  <p>A Sequence Diagram shows how objects interact with each other over time, visualizing the flow of information and control between different objects in the system. Unlike Class Diagrams (which show static structure), Activity Diagrams (which show workflow), or Component Diagrams (which show organization and dependencies), Sequence Diagrams specifically capture the temporal ordering of messages and interactions between objects.</p>
