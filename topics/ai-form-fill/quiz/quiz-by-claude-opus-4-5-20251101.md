  <p>To automatically populate form fields with relevant information based on user data and context</p>
  <p>AI form fill (also known as form autofill or autocomplete) uses artificial intelligence to recognize and extract relevant information from a user's previous interactions, stored data, or external sources—such as name, address, email, and phone number—to automatically populate form fields. This reduces the manual effort required for data entry while leveraging data analysis and prediction to suggest the most likely values for each field.</p>
