# Agile principle 4: Work together

"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."

Daily collaboration between business people and developers is essential for successful software delivery, ensuring that technical solutions align with business objectives throughout the project lifecycle. This principle prevents the common pitfall of developers building features in isolation, only to discover they don't meet actual business needs.

This principle transforms software development from a handoff-based process to a collaborative conversation. When business stakeholders understand technical limitations and developers comprehend business priorities, teams make better decisions faster. The result is software that not only works technically but delivers genuine business value, reducing rework and accelerating time-to-market while maintaining quality standards.

Spotify exemplifies this approach through their squad model, where cross-functional teams include product owners, developers, and designers working in the same physical or virtual space. Product owners participate in daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, providing immediate feedback on feature priorities and clarifying requirements as they emerge. This continuous dialogue enables rapid pivoting when market conditions change or user feedback reveals new insights.

Amazon's two-pizza teams demonstrate another effective implementation, where small autonomous teams include both technical and business stakeholders. Business analysts work alongside developers daily, translating customer needs into technical requirements and validating solutions through rapid prototyping. This close collaboration enabled Amazon to quickly adapt their e-commerce platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, scaling grocery delivery capabilities within weeks.

At Netflix, product managers embed directly with engineering teams, participating in technical discussions and helping prioritize bug fixes versus new features based on real-time user data. This daily interaction ensures that technical debt decisions consider business impact, while business decisions account for technical constraints.
