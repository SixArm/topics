# Agile principle 4: Work together

"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."

Continuous collaboration between business stakeholders and development teams throughout the entire project lifecycle is of critical importance. This principle challenges traditional software development approaches where business requirements are gathered at the beginning and handed off to developers with minimal ongoing interaction.

Daily collaboration ensures that business needs are accurately understood and implemented while maintaining alignment with evolving market conditions and organizational priorities. When business people and developers work together regularly, they can quickly identify and resolve misunderstandings, clarify requirements, and make informed decisions about trade-offs between features, timeline, and resources.

This close partnership enables rapid feedback loops that are essential for Agile success. Business representatives can provide immediate input on prototypes, user stories, and working software increments, allowing developers to course-correct early rather than discovering issues during final delivery. The constant communication helps prevent the common scenario where technically perfect software fails to meet actual business objectives.

The principle also promotes shared ownership and accountability. Business stakeholders gain deeper appreciation for technical constraints and possibilities, while developers develop stronger understanding of business context and user needs. This mutual understanding leads to more innovative solutions and better decision-making throughout the project.

Implementing daily collaboration requires commitment from both sides. Business people must dedicate time to participate in standups, sprint reviews, and planning sessions, while developers need to communicate technical concepts in business-friendly terms. Modern tools like collaborative platforms, video conferencing, and shared dashboards facilitate this ongoing partnership, even in distributed teams. Success depends on creating an environment where both groups feel comfortable asking questions, sharing concerns, and working together toward common goals.
