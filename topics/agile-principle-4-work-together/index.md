# Agile principle 4: Work together

"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."

This principle challenges traditional software development approaches where business requirements are gathered at the beginning and handed off to developers with minimal ongoing interaction.

Daily collaboration ensures that business needs are accurately understood and implemented while maintaining alignment with evolving market conditions and organizational priorities. When business people and developers work together regularly, they can quickly identify and resolve misunderstandings, clarify requirements, and make informed decisions about trade-offs between features, timeline, and resources.

This close partnership enables rapid feedback loops that are essential. Business representatives can provide immediate input on prototypes, user stories, and working software increments, allowing developers to course-correct early rather than discovering issues during final delivery. The constant communication helps prevent the common scenario where technically perfect software fails to meet actual business objectives.

The principle also promotes shared ownership and accountability. Business stakeholders gain deeper appreciation for technical constraints and possibilities, while developers develop stronger understanding of business context and needs. This mutual understanding helps decision-making and innovation.

Implementing daily collaboration requires commitment from both sides. Business people must dedicate time to participate, and developers need to communicate technical concepts in business-friendly terms. Success depends on creating an environment where both groups feel comfortable asking questions, sharing concerns, and working together toward common goals.
