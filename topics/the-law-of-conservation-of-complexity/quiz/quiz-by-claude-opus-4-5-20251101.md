# The Law of Conservation of Complexity

Question: What is the core principle of the Law of Conservation of Complexity (Tesler's Law)?

- [ ] Complexity should be distributed evenly across all parts of a system to ensure balanced performance
- [ ] Every application inherently requires a minimum amount of complexity that cannot be removed, only shifted between the system and the user
- [ ] Systems become more complex over time and this growth cannot be prevented
- [ ] Adding more features always reduces overall system complexity by providing more options

  <p>Every application inherently requires a minimum amount of complexity that cannot be removed, only shifted between the system and the user</p>
  <p>Tesler's Law states that complexity is a finite resource that must be conserved—every increase in complexity in one part of a system must be offset by a corresponding decrease elsewhere. This means designers must decide where complexity should reside: either the system absorbs it (through better design and engineering) or the user must deal with it. The principle encourages designers to shift complexity away from users by building it into the system, making products simpler and more intuitive to use.</p>
