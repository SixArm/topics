# United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)

The United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) is a standardized, evolving set of health data classes and constituent data elements, developed by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC), that enables nationwide, interoperable health information exchange. It serves as a foundational "floor" for data quality and consistency across certified Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and IT systems.

Purpose: Ensures consistent, common-language data (e.g., patient demographics, medications, allergies, laboratory results) is exchanged efficiently to improve patient care.

Structure: Comprised of data classes (e.g., Clinical Notes, Provenance) and granular data elements, including social determinants of health.

Evolution: Updated annually, with USCDI V3 mandated for certified health IT by January 1, 2026, and V4/V5 in development.

Compliance: Mandatory for EHR certification; non-compliance can lead to information-blocking fines.
