# Precision

Question: In machine learning classification, what does precision measure?

- [ ] The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified
- [ ] The overall percentage of correct predictions across all classes
- [ ] The proportion of predicted positives that were actually correct
- [ ] The harmonic mean of true positives and true negatives

  <p>The proportion of predicted positives that were actually correct</p>
  <p>Precision is calculated as TP/(TP+FP), which measures how often the model is correct when it predicts a positive result. It answers the question: "Of all the instances the model labeled as positive, how many were truly positive?" This is particularly important in scenarios where false positives are costly, such as spam detection or medical diagnosis.</p>
