  <p>Centralized decision-making with authority concentrated at the top of the hierarchy</p>
  <p>Command and control (C2) is defined by centralized decision-making, where authority resides at the top levels of the organization. Managers and leaders make decisions that are then communicated downward through a clear chain of command. This approach involves hierarchical structures, direct supervision, formal communication channels, and an emphasis on compliance and obedience. While effective in emergency situations or military operations requiring quick decisions and clear directives, it has been criticized in dynamic environments where agility, creativity, and employee empowerment are valued.</p>
