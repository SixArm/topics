  <p>Scrumban</p>
  <p>Scrumban is a hybrid methodology that merges Scrum's iterative sprint structure and roles with Kanban's continuous flow, visual boards, and work-in-progress limits. This combination allows teams to maintain Scrum ceremonies while gaining Kanban's flexibility to pull work as capacity allows, making it particularly useful for teams transitioning between methodologies or handling both project work and ongoing maintenance.</p>
