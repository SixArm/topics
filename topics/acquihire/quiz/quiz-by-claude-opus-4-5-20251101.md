  <p>To acquire a company primarily for its talented employees</p>
  <p>An acquihire (a portmanteau of "acquisition" and "hire") is a business strategy where a company acquires another company primarily for the talent and expertise of its employees, rather than for its products, services, or other assets. This approach is particularly common in the technology industry, where companies compete for highly skilled and specialized talent that is difficult to recruit through traditional hiring processes.</p>
