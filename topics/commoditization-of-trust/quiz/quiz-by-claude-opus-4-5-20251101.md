  <p>Enabling users to rate and review each other based on their experiences</p>
  <p>Digital platforms have commoditized trust by creating standardized rating and review systems. Instead of relying on personal relationships or reputation built over time, users can now depend on aggregated feedback from other users' experiences. This makes trust quantifiable, transferable, and scalable—essentially turning it into a tradeable commodity that enables strangers to transact with confidence.</p>
