  <p>An incorrect prediction that the condition is absent when it is actually present</p>
  <p>A false negative occurs when a model incorrectly predicts the negative class—for example, predicting that a patient does not have a tumor when they actually do. This type of error can be particularly costly in scenarios like medical diagnosis or fraud detection, where missing a positive case has serious consequences.</p>
