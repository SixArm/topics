# True Negative Rate (TNR)

Question: What does the true negative rate (TNR), also known as specificity, measure in a binary classification model?

- [ ] The proportion of actual positive instances correctly identified as positive
- [ ] The overall accuracy of the model across all predictions
- [ ] The proportion of actual negative instances correctly identified as negative
- [ ] The ratio of false negatives to total predictions

  <p>The proportion of actual negative instances correctly identified as negative</p>
  <p>True negative rate (TNR), also called specificity or correct rejection rate, measures how well a model identifies negative instances. It is calculated as True Negatives divided by (True Negatives + False Positives). This metric is particularly important in applications where the cost of false positives is high, such as medical screening or fraud detection systems.</p>
