  <p>Generating and delivering benefits by solving customer problems and addressing unmet needs</p>
  <p>Value creation fundamentally involves identifying customer pain points and desires, then developing solutions that effectively address those challenges. This creates positive impact by alleviating pain points and improving outcomes for customers, stakeholders, and society. While revenue, competitive positioning, and cost efficiency matter, they are outcomes of successful value creation rather than its core purpose.</p>
