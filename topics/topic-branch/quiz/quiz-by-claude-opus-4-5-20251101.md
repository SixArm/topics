# Topic branch

Question: What is the primary purpose of using a topic branch in Git?

  <p>To isolate changes related to a specific feature or task without interfering with other work</p>
  <p>Topic branches allow developers to work on different features or tasks independently. Changes are isolated to the topic branch and won't affect the main branch or other topic branches until they are explicitly merged. This supports parallel development, easier code reviews, and a clearer history of changes in the codebase.</p>
