# Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)

A Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) is a publicly traded shell company formed specifically to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) with the sole purpose of acquiring an existing private company. Often called "blank-check companies," SPACs have no commercial operations, products, or revenue at the time of their IPO. They exist purely as financial vehicles to take a private company public through a reverse merger. For technology professionals, SPACs are relevant because they have become a significant pathway for tech startups and growth-stage companies to access public markets, often faster and with more pricing certainty than a traditional IPO.

## How a SPAC Works

The SPAC lifecycle follows a structured sequence of phases, each with distinct stakeholders, milestones, and regulatory requirements.

**Formation and Sponsorship.** A group of sponsors — typically seasoned investors, former executives, or private equity professionals — form a shell company and file with the SEC to conduct an IPO. The sponsors fund initial operating expenses and receive a "promote," usually 20% of the post-IPO equity, as compensation for organizing the vehicle.

**IPO and Trust.** The SPAC conducts its IPO, selling units (typically one share of common stock plus a fraction of a warrant) at a standard price of $10 per unit. The gross proceeds are deposited into an interest-bearing trust account held by a third-party trustee. These funds cannot be released until a business combination is completed or the SPAC is liquidated.

**Target Search and Due Diligence.** The SPAC management team identifies, evaluates, and negotiates with potential acquisition targets. This phase must be completed within a defined window, usually 18 to 24 months from the IPO date.

**De-SPAC Transaction.** Once a target is selected, the SPAC announces a definitive merger agreement. Shareholders vote on the proposed business combination. Investors who do not approve may redeem their shares at approximately the original trust value per share. Upon approval, the merger closes, and the formerly private company becomes publicly listed.

**Post-Merger Public Company.** After the de-SPAC, the combined entity trades on a stock exchange under a new ticker symbol. The former target company's management typically runs the ongoing business, while SPAC sponsors may retain board seats or advisory roles.

## Key Participants and Roles

| Participant | Role | Typical Incentive |
|---|---|---|
| SPAC Sponsors | Form the shell company, raise IPO capital, identify and negotiate the acquisition target | Founder shares (promote), usually 20% of post-IPO equity at nominal cost |
| Public Investors | Purchase units in the SPAC IPO, vote on proposed acquisitions, may redeem shares | Upside from a successful merger; downside protection via trust redemption |
| Target Company | Private company that merges with the SPAC to become publicly traded | Access to public capital markets, liquidity for existing shareholders |
| Underwriters | Manage the SPAC IPO process and may advise on the de-SPAC transaction | Underwriting fees, typically 5.5% of gross proceeds (deferred portion paid at merger) |
| PIPE Investors | Provide additional capital at the time of the de-SPAC through a Private Investment in Public Equity | Shares at a negotiated price, often at a discount, to backstop redemptions |
| Trustees | Hold IPO proceeds in trust until a business combination or liquidation | Fiduciary fees |

## SPAC vs. Traditional IPO vs. Direct Listing

| Dimension | SPAC | Traditional IPO | Direct Listing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time to market | 3–6 months (de-SPAC phase) | 6–12+ months | 3–6 months |
| Price discovery | Negotiated between SPAC and target | Bookbuilding with institutional investors | Open market on listing day |
| Capital raised | IPO trust + potential PIPE financing | New shares sold in offering | No new capital raised (existing shares sold) |
| Regulatory complexity | SEC review of proxy/S-4; less roadshow burden | Full S-1 registration, extensive roadshow | SEC review, no underwriter-led roadshow |
| Dilution sources | Sponsor promote, warrants, PIPE | Underwriter discount, greenshoe option | Minimal structural dilution |
| Certainty of valuation | High (pre-negotiated) | Lower (market-dependent pricing) | Market-determined on day one |
| Forward projections | Permitted in proxy materials | Generally prohibited in S-1 | Generally prohibited |
| Investor redemption right | Yes, shareholders can redeem at trust value | No | No |

## Advantages of SPACs

- **Speed to public markets.** The de-SPAC merger process is typically faster than a traditional IPO, enabling companies to capitalize on favorable market conditions or strategic timing.
- **Valuation certainty.** Because the merger price is negotiated in advance, the target company has greater confidence in its valuation compared to the bookbuilding process of a traditional IPO.
- **Forward-looking projections.** SPAC merger proxy materials may include financial projections and forecasts, which are generally not permitted in a traditional IPO prospectus. This is particularly valuable for pre-revenue or early-revenue technology companies.
- **Access to sponsor expertise.** Experienced SPAC sponsors can contribute industry knowledge, operational guidance, and board-level governance to the target company.
- **Investor downside protection.** Public shareholders can redeem their shares at approximately the trust value per share if they do not support the proposed acquisition, creating a built-in floor.
- **Simplified process for target companies.** The target company's management team spends less time on roadshows and can remain focused on operations during the transaction.

## Risks and Drawbacks

- **Sponsor dilution.** The 20% founder promote and outstanding warrants dilute public shareholders, effectively transferring value from investors to sponsors regardless of post-merger performance.
- **Misaligned incentives.** Sponsors face pressure to complete a deal within the deadline, which can lead to acquiring a suboptimal target or overpaying. Their promote vests upon deal completion, not upon long-term value creation.
- **High redemption rates.** If a large percentage of shareholders redeem before the merger, the SPAC may have insufficient capital to complete the transaction without significant PIPE financing, adding complexity and dilution.
- **Post-merger performance.** Academic and market research has shown that many de-SPAC companies underperform traditional IPOs in the first one to two years following the merger, partly due to structural dilution and partly due to target quality.
- **Regulatory scrutiny.** The SEC has increased oversight of SPAC transactions, including proposed rules around enhanced disclosure requirements, liability standards for projections, and accounting treatment of warrants.
- **Lack of transparency.** During the target search phase, investors commit capital without knowing which company will be acquired, creating an information asymmetry between sponsors and public shareholders.

## SPAC Economics and the Promote Structure

The financial mechanics of a SPAC are driven by the sponsor promote. In a typical structure, sponsors purchase founder shares for a nominal amount — often $25,000 — representing 20% of the post-IPO shares outstanding. This means that for every $10 invested by public shareholders, approximately $2 of value is allocated to sponsors before the target company generates any returns.

Warrants add another layer of dilution. Each unit sold in the IPO typically includes a fraction of a warrant (commonly one-third or one-half of a warrant per unit), exercisable at $11.50 per share. When exercised, these warrants issue new shares and further dilute existing holders.

The combined effect of the promote and warrants means that the effective cost to public shareholders is meaningfully higher than the nominal $10 per unit price. Technology professionals evaluating a SPAC transaction — whether as a potential target, an investor, or an advisor — should model the fully diluted share count and the implied enterprise value accordingly.

## SPACs in the Technology Sector

SPACs became a prominent vehicle for technology companies between 2020 and 2022, when hundreds of technology-focused SPACs launched and completed mergers. Categories that attracted significant SPAC activity include:

- **Electric vehicles and autonomous driving.** Companies such as Lucid Motors, Nikola, and several lidar and sensor firms went public via SPACs.
- **Space technology.** Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, and other space-related ventures used SPACs to access public markets.
- **Enterprise software and SaaS.** Several B2B software companies chose the SPAC route for its speed and projection-friendly disclosure format.
- **Fintech and insurtech.** Digital banking, payments, and insurance platforms pursued SPAC mergers to accelerate growth capital access.
- **AI and data analytics.** Early-stage artificial intelligence companies used SPACs to go public before achieving profitability, leveraging the ability to present forward projections.

The subsequent performance of many technology de-SPACs was mixed, leading to increased investor skepticism and tighter SEC scrutiny. By 2023, SPAC issuance volumes had declined sharply from their 2021 peak, though the vehicle remains available for companies with strong fundamentals and credible sponsors.

## Regulatory Landscape

The SEC has taken an increasingly active role in SPAC oversight. Key regulatory developments include:

- **Enhanced disclosure rules.** Proposed rules requiring SPACs to provide more detailed information about sponsor compensation, dilution, conflicts of interest, and the fairness of the de-SPAC transaction.
- **Projection liability.** The SEC has questioned whether the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) safe harbor for forward-looking statements should apply to de-SPAC transactions, potentially exposing sponsors and targets to greater liability for projections.
- **Warrant accounting.** SEC staff guidance in 2021 required many SPACs to reclassify warrants from equity to liabilities, triggering restatements and increasing accounting complexity.
- **Investment Company Act considerations.** The SEC has examined whether SPACs holding IPO proceeds in trust for extended periods could be classified as investment companies, which would impose additional regulatory burdens.

Technology professionals involved in SPAC transactions should work closely with securities counsel to navigate these evolving requirements.

## Summary

A Special Purpose Acquisition Company is a shell entity that raises capital through an IPO to acquire a private company, effectively taking it public through a reverse merger. SPACs offer speed, valuation certainty, and the ability to present forward projections, making them attractive to technology companies seeking public market access. However, the sponsor promote structure, warrant dilution, misaligned incentives, and mixed post-merger performance records represent material risks for investors. Regulatory scrutiny has intensified, and SPAC volumes have moderated from their 2021 peak. Technology professionals evaluating SPACs — whether as target company executives, investors, board members, or advisors — should rigorously model the fully diluted economics, assess sponsor credibility and track record, and account for the evolving regulatory environment before committing to a SPAC transaction.
