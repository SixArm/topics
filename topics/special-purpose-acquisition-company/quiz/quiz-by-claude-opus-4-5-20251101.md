  <p>The capital is returned to investors</p>
  <p>SPACs are required to complete an acquisition within a specified period, typically two years. If the SPAC fails to identify and complete an acquisition within this timeframe, the funds held in the trust account must be returned to the investors. This investor protection mechanism is a key characteristic that distinguishes SPACs from other investment vehicles and provides downside protection for participants.</p>
