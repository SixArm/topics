- [ ] Participating investors receive their investment amount and then also share in the remaining proceeds pro-rata
- [ ] Participating investors can only receive up to 2x their original investment
- [ ] Non-participating investors always receive a higher payout than participating investors

  <p>With participating liquidation preference, investors first receive their initial investment amount back, and then they also participate in the distribution of the remaining proceeds according to their pro-rata ownership share. This is sometimes called "double-dipping." In contrast, non-participating investors receive either their investment amount or their pro-rata share of proceeds—whichever is higher—but not both.</p>
