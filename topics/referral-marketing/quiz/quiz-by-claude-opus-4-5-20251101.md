  <p>People tend to trust recommendations from friends and family more than advertisements</p>
  <p>Referral marketing leverages the personal networks and established trust relationships of existing customers. Because people are inherently more likely to trust recommendations from people they know compared to corporate advertisements, referrals convert at higher rates and often bring in customers who are better aligned with the product or service.</p>
