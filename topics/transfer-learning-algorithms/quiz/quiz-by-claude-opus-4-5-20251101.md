# Transfer Learning Algorithms

Question: What is the primary benefit of using transfer learning in machine learning?

- [ ] It eliminates the need for any training data in the new task
- [ ] It allows reusing knowledge from previously learned tasks, which is especially beneficial when the new task has limited data or computational resources
- [ ] It guarantees that the model will always outperform models trained from scratch
- [ ] It requires training separate models for each new task to ensure optimal performance

  <p>It allows reusing knowledge from previously learned tasks, which is especially beneficial when the new task has limited data or computational resources</p>
  <p>Transfer learning leverages knowledge learned from one task or domain to improve performance on another related task. Instead of training a model from scratch for each new task, transfer learning enables reuse of previously learned knowledge, making it particularly valuable when the new task has limited data or computational resources available.</p>
