  <p>Combining automated testing for repetitive validations with human testing for subjective aspects</p>
  <p>A hybrid strategy that combines automated testing for repetitive validations and regression detection with human testing for creativity, empathy, and complex user scenarios ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining efficiency. Automated tools excel at detecting unintended changes, verifying accessibility compliance, and testing across platforms, but cannot replace human evaluation for subjective aspects like aesthetic appeal and intuitive design.</p>
