# Full Ratchet

Full ratchet is an anti-dilution provision commonly found in venture capital financing agreements. It protects preferred stock investors by adjusting their share price downward if a company later issues equity at a lower valuation. This mechanism ensures that early investors maintain their ownership percentage even when a company experiences a "down round," making it one of the strongest forms of investor protection in startup financing.

## How Full Ratchet Works

When a full ratchet clause is triggered, the conversion price of an investor's preferred shares is retroactively reduced to match the price per share of the new, lower-priced round. The investor does not receive additional cash; instead, their existing preferred shares become convertible into a greater number of common shares, preserving the economic value of their original investment relative to the new valuation.

Consider the following scenario:

- **Series A**: An investor puts in $1 million at $10 per share, receiving 100,000 shares.
- **Series B (down round)**: New shares are issued at $5 per share.
- **Full ratchet adjustment**: The Series A investor's conversion price drops from $10 to $5, meaning their $1 million investment now converts into 200,000 shares instead of 100,000.

The critical point is that the adjustment applies regardless of how many shares are issued in the down round. Even if the company sells a single share at the lower price, the full ratchet provision reprices the entire earlier investment.

## Full Ratchet vs. Weighted Average Anti-Dilution

These are the two primary anti-dilution mechanisms used in venture capital term sheets. They differ significantly in their impact on founders and existing shareholders.

| Factor | Full Ratchet | Weighted Average |
|---|---|---|
| Conversion price adjustment | Drops to the exact price of the new round | Drops to a weighted average of old and new prices |
| Impact on founders | Severe dilution | Moderate dilution |
| Size of new round matters | No; any issuance at a lower price triggers full adjustment | Yes; a smaller round causes less adjustment |
| Investor protection level | Maximum | Partial |
| Prevalence in practice | Less common | More common |
| Negotiation leverage signal | Investor-favorable market | Balanced market |

The weighted average approach factors in both the price and the number of shares issued in the down round, producing a blended conversion price. This is generally considered fairer because a small financing at a low price does not disproportionately punish earlier shareholders.

## When Full Ratchet Provisions Appear

Full ratchet clauses tend to appear in specific market conditions and deal structures:

- **Distressed companies**: When a startup is raising capital from a position of weakness, investors may demand full ratchet as a condition of participation.
- **Early-stage deals with high uncertainty**: Some seed and Series A investors negotiate full ratchet when the company's valuation is speculative.
- **Investor-favorable markets**: During downturns in the venture capital market, investors have more negotiating power and may insist on stronger protections.
- **Bridge financing**: Short-term loans that convert to equity sometimes carry full ratchet provisions as compensation for the additional risk.

## Implications for Founders and Early Employees

Full ratchet provisions create meaningful consequences for company insiders:

- **Significant equity dilution**: Founders and employees holding common stock bear the full brunt of the repricing, because the additional shares granted to protected investors come at their expense.
- **Reduced incentive alignment**: Severe dilution can demotivate founding teams, which is counterproductive to company success.
- **Complicated cap table management**: Retroactive repricing adds complexity to capitalization tables and future fundraising negotiations.
- **Diminished attractiveness to future investors**: Prospective investors in later rounds may view existing full ratchet provisions as a red flag, signaling either poor governance or unfavorable terms that could complicate the capital structure.

## Negotiation Strategies

Founders and their legal counsel can take several approaches when faced with a full ratchet demand:

- **Counter with weighted average**: Propose broad-based weighted average anti-dilution as a more balanced alternative.
- **Add a time limit (sunset clause)**: Negotiate for the full ratchet provision to expire after a set period, such as 12 or 18 months.
- **Include a pay-to-play requirement**: Require investors to participate in the down round proportionally in order to benefit from the anti-dilution protection.
- **Set a price floor**: Establish a minimum conversion price below which the ratchet does not apply.
- **Carve out specific issuances**: Exclude certain share issuances from triggering the ratchet, such as employee stock options, strategic partnerships, or small equity grants.

## Related

Professionals exploring full ratchet provisions should also study weighted average anti-dilution, down round financing, liquidation preferences, pay-to-play provisions, anti-dilution clauses broadly, preferred stock terms, venture capital term sheets, cap table management, dilution mechanics, convertible notes, SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity), and protective provisions in shareholder agreements.

## Summary

Full ratchet is a powerful anti-dilution mechanism that retroactively reprices an investor's shares to match any lower-priced future issuance, providing maximum protection against valuation declines. While it offers significant security for investors, it imposes severe dilution on founders and common shareholders, and its presence in a term sheet often signals either a challenging fundraising environment or strong investor leverage. Most venture capital deals today favor the weighted average approach as a more balanced compromise, but understanding full ratchet remains essential for any technology professional involved in startup financing, fundraising strategy, or equity negotiations.
