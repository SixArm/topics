# Full Ratchet: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

## What Is Full Ratchet?

Full ratchet is an anti-dilution provision commonly found in venture capital financing agreements. It protects investors from equity dilution when a company issues new shares at a price lower than what earlier investors paid. When triggered, this provision reprices all previously issued preferred shares to match the new, lower price—effectively giving earlier investors more shares to maintain their ownership percentage despite the reduced valuation.

This mechanism is considered one of the strongest forms of investor protection available in startup financing. It's typically embedded in the terms of preferred stock and activates automatically during a "down round"—a financing event where the company's valuation decreases from prior rounds.

## How Full Ratchet Works

The mechanics of full ratchet are straightforward but have significant implications:

1. **Initial Investment**: An investor purchases preferred shares at a specific price per share
2. **Down Round Occurs**: The company later raises capital at a lower price per share
3. **Automatic Repricing**: The earlier investor's conversion price adjusts downward to match the new lower price
4. **Share Increase**: The investor receives additional shares (or conversion rights to additional shares) as if they had originally invested at the lower price

### Practical Example

Consider this scenario:

| Round | Valuation | Price Per Share | Shares Issued | Investor |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| Series A | $10 million | $10.00 | 1 million | Investor A |
| Series B | $5 million | $2.50 | 2 million | Investor B |

**Without full ratchet**: Investor A holds 1 million shares worth $2.50 each (now valued at $2.5 million, down from $10 million).

**With full ratchet**: Investor A's shares are repriced to $2.50. Their original $10 million investment now converts to 4 million shares instead of 1 million, preserving their economic position relative to the new valuation.

## Full Ratchet vs. Weighted-Average Anti-Dilution

The two primary anti-dilution mechanisms in venture financing offer different levels of protection:

| Aspect | Full Ratchet | Weighted-Average |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Protection Level** | Maximum investor protection | Moderate investor protection |
| **Calculation** | Matches lowest price exactly | Blends old and new prices based on shares issued |
| **Founder Impact** | Severely dilutive to founders | Less dilutive to founders |
| **Prevalence** | Less common | Industry standard |
| **Negotiating Power** | Favors investors heavily | Balanced approach |
| **Down Round Sensitivity** | Triggered by any lower-priced issuance | Impact proportional to down round size |

### Weighted-Average Formula Consideration

Weighted-average provisions use a formula that factors in both the number of new shares issued and the price difference. This means a small down round has a proportionally small impact, whereas full ratchet treats all down rounds equally harshly regardless of size.

## When Full Ratchet Is Used

Full ratchet provisions typically appear in specific circumstances:

- **High-risk investments**: When investors perceive elevated risk and demand stronger protection
- **Distressed companies**: Firms with uncertain futures seeking capital
- **Investor leverage situations**: When capital is scarce and investors hold negotiating power
- **Bridge financing**: Short-term loans that convert to equity often include full ratchet terms
- **Early-stage investments**: Some seed investors demand full ratchet given uncertainty

## Implications for Stakeholders

### For Founders and Employees

- **Significant dilution risk**: A down round can dramatically reduce founder ownership
- **Motivation concerns**: Stock option holders may see their equity value diminished
- **Fundraising constraints**: Full ratchet terms may deter future investors who recognize the harsh dilution mechanics

### For Existing Investors

- **Strong downside protection**: Ownership percentage remains intact regardless of valuation drops
- **Alignment issues**: May create conflicts with founders whose interests diverge during difficult periods
- **Portfolio considerations**: Aggressive terms can damage founder relationships across multiple investments

### For New Investors

- **Complex cap table**: Full ratchet conversions create ownership changes that must be carefully modeled
- **Founder incentive concerns**: New investors may worry about founder motivation post-dilution
- **Negotiation baseline**: Existing full ratchet terms set expectations for future rounds

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

- Provides certainty for investors regarding ownership protection
- Simple to understand and calculate
- Creates strong incentive for company to maintain or increase valuation
- Offers maximum protection against valuation decline

### Disadvantages

- Punishes founders disproportionately for circumstances beyond their control
- May discourage companies from raising necessary capital during difficult periods
- Can create perverse incentives to delay fundraising
- Often considered overly aggressive in modern venture financing
- May signal lack of confidence in the company's prospects

## Negotiation Considerations

Technology professionals involved in financing negotiations should consider these factors:

**For Companies**:
- Request carve-outs for specific issuances (employee options, strategic partnerships)
- Negotiate sunset provisions that convert full ratchet to weighted-average after certain milestones
- Limit full ratchet to specific time windows
- Include pay-to-play provisions requiring investors to participate in future rounds to maintain protection

**For Investors**:
- Consider the signal full ratchet sends about confidence in the company
- Evaluate whether weighted-average provides sufficient protection
- Assess the impact on founder motivation and retention
- Factor in reputation effects for future deal flow

## Key Takeaways

- Full ratchet is the most aggressive form of anti-dilution protection, repricing shares to match any lower-priced issuance
- The provision heavily favors investors at the expense of founders and other common shareholders
- Weighted-average anti-dilution is more common and considered more balanced
- Full ratchet can create misaligned incentives and discourage necessary fundraising
- Negotiating parties should carefully consider the long-term implications of these provisions on company dynamics and stakeholder relationships

Understanding full ratchet provisions is essential for technology professionals navigating venture financing, whether as founders seeking capital, employees evaluating equity compensation, or investors structuring deals. The choice between full ratchet and weighted-average anti-dilution reflects fundamental assumptions about risk allocation and stakeholder alignment in startup financing.
