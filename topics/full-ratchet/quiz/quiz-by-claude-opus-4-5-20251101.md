  <p>Their shares are repriced to match the lower valuation of the new round</p>
  <p>A full ratchet provision protects investors from dilution by repricing their existing shares to the lower price of a subsequent funding round. This means if a company issues new shares at a lower price than previous rounds, existing investors' shares are adjusted as if they had been issued at that lower price originally, effectively giving them more shares to maintain their investment value relative to the new pricing.</p>
