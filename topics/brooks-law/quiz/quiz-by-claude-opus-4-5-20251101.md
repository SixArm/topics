  <p>Adding people only makes the project later</p>
  <p>Brooks' Law, introduced by Fred Brooks in "The Mythical Man-Month" (1975), states that adding more people to a late project only makes it later. This occurs because new team members require time to get up to speed, and more people create additional communication overhead and coordination complexity, which ultimately slows down progress rather than accelerating it.</p>
