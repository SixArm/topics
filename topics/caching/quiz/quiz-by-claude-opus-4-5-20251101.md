  <p>To store frequently accessed data in high-speed memory for faster retrieval</p>
  <p>Caching is fundamentally about improving performance by storing data or information in a high-speed memory cache so it can be retrieved faster than accessing it from its original source. This technique is used across many systems including web browsers, databases, operating systems, and content delivery networks to reduce access times and improve application performance.</p>
