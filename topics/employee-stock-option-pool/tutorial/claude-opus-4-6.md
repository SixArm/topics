# Employee stock option pool

An employee stock option pool is a reserve of company shares set aside by a startup or established company to grant as stock options to employees, contractors, and advisors. The pool represents one of the most important mechanisms in technology companies for attracting, incentivizing, and retaining talent. By offering equity ownership, companies align individual interests with organizational success, giving team members a direct financial stake in the company's growth. Understanding how option pools work is essential for technology professionals, whether they are founders structuring compensation, executives managing equity budgets, or individual contributors evaluating job offers.

## How an option pool is created

When a company is incorporated, its certificate of incorporation authorizes a fixed number of shares. These authorized shares are initially allocated among founders and early investors. The board of directors then designates a portion of shares, either from the remaining authorized pool or through an increase in authorized shares, as the employee stock option pool. This reserved block of equity is not immediately issued; instead, it sits available for future grants as the company hires and rewards its team. The creation of the pool typically requires board approval and, depending on the company's structure, shareholder consent. The pool is usually established before or during a financing round, since investors want clarity on the dilution impact before they invest.

## Typical pool sizes

The size of an option pool depends on the company's stage, industry norms, hiring plans, and negotiating leverage with investors. Below is a general guide to typical pool sizes at different stages.

| Company Stage | Typical Pool Size (% of fully diluted shares) | Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-seed / Seed | 10% - 15% | Enough to recruit initial key hires and advisors |
| Series A | 15% - 20% | Expanded to cover engineering, product, and leadership hires |
| Series B and beyond | 10% - 15% (refresh) | Pools are topped up to retain existing employees and attract senior talent |
| Pre-IPO | 5% - 10% (refresh) | Smaller additions focused on retention grants and executive recruitment |

Investors often negotiate for a larger pre-money option pool so that dilution from future grants falls on existing shareholders rather than new investors. Founders should model their hiring plan carefully to avoid creating an unnecessarily large pool that dilutes their own ownership.

## How stock options work

When an employee receives a stock option grant, they are given the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a specific number of shares at a predetermined price called the exercise price or strike price. The exercise price is set at the fair market value of the company's common stock on the date of grant, as determined by an independent 409A valuation. If the company's value increases over time, the difference between the current value and the exercise price represents the employee's potential gain. The employee realizes this gain only when they exercise the options and, eventually, sell the resulting shares during a liquidity event such as an acquisition or IPO.

## Vesting schedules

Stock options vest over time to encourage long-term retention. The most common arrangement in technology companies is a four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff.

- **One-year cliff**: No options vest during the first twelve months of employment. If the employee leaves before the cliff date, they forfeit the entire grant.
- **Monthly or quarterly vesting**: After the cliff, options vest in equal increments each month or quarter over the remaining three years.
- **Acceleration clauses**: Some grants include single-trigger or double-trigger acceleration, which partially or fully accelerates vesting upon events such as a change of control or termination without cause following an acquisition.
- **Extended exercise windows**: Standard option agreements give departing employees 90 days to exercise vested options, but some companies offer extended windows of several years to reduce the financial pressure on departing team members.

## Types of stock options

Technology companies primarily use two types of stock options, each with distinct tax treatment.

| Feature | Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) | Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs) |
|---|---|---|
| Eligibility | Employees only | Employees, contractors, advisors |
| Tax at exercise | No ordinary income tax at exercise (but may trigger AMT) | Ordinary income tax on the spread at exercise |
| Tax at sale | Long-term capital gains if holding periods are met | Capital gains on any appreciation after exercise |
| Annual grant limit | $100,000 in value vesting per year | No statutory limit |
| Company deduction | No deduction for the company | Company can deduct the spread as compensation expense |

ISOs are generally preferred by employees due to favorable tax treatment, while NSOs provide more flexibility for the company and are necessary for non-employee recipients.

## The 409A valuation

The exercise price of stock options must be set at or above the fair market value of the company's common stock to avoid adverse tax consequences. The fair market value is established through an independent appraisal known as a 409A valuation, named after Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Companies typically obtain a new 409A valuation annually, after any material event such as a financing round, and before issuing new option grants. A stale or improperly conducted 409A valuation exposes the company and its option holders to significant tax penalties, including immediate taxation and a 20% penalty on the deferred compensation.

## Dilution and cap table impact

Every option granted from the pool represents potential dilution to existing shareholders. Technology professionals should understand how the option pool interacts with the cap table.

- **Fully diluted shares**: The total share count used for ownership calculations includes all outstanding shares, all shares reserved in the option pool (whether granted or not), and all shares issuable upon conversion of convertible instruments.
- **Pre-money vs. post-money pool**: When investors negotiate the option pool as part of the pre-money valuation, the dilution falls on founders and existing shareholders. When the pool is calculated on a post-money basis, the dilution is shared with the new investors.
- **Unallocated pool shares**: Shares reserved but not yet granted still count toward dilution in a fully diluted calculation. An oversized pool unnecessarily reduces founder and employee ownership percentages.
- **Pool refreshes**: As options are granted, the unallocated pool shrinks. Companies periodically increase the pool through board and shareholder approval, typically in connection with new financing rounds.

## Key considerations for technology professionals

Whether evaluating a job offer, negotiating a grant, or planning a company's equity compensation strategy, technology professionals should keep several factors in mind.

- **Percentage ownership matters more than share count**: A grant of 10,000 shares means little without knowing the total fully diluted share count. Always ask for the percentage of the company the grant represents.
- **Exercise price and current valuation**: Compare the exercise price to the latest 409A valuation and the most recent preferred share price from the last funding round to understand the built-in discount or premium.
- **Vesting timeline and cliff**: Understand the vesting schedule and whether any acceleration provisions exist in the event of an acquisition.
- **Exercise cost and tax implications**: Calculate the total cost to exercise the options and the potential tax liability at exercise, particularly for ISOs that may trigger the alternative minimum tax.
- **Liquidity timeline**: Options have value only if the shares can eventually be sold. Assess the company's realistic path to a liquidity event such as an IPO, acquisition, or secondary sale.
- **Post-termination exercise period**: Confirm how long you have to exercise vested options after leaving the company, since a short window can force difficult financial decisions.

## Summary

An employee stock option pool is a foundational element of equity compensation in technology companies. It serves as the reservoir from which companies draw to attract, incentivize, and retain the talent necessary to build and scale their organizations. The pool's size, the terms of individual grants, vesting schedules, exercise prices anchored to 409A valuations, and the tax characteristics of ISOs versus NSOs all interact to determine the real value that employees and other recipients ultimately receive. For technology professionals, developing a thorough understanding of how option pools function is critical to making informed decisions about career opportunities, compensation negotiations, and company-building strategy.
