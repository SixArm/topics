# Employee Stock Option Pool

## What Is an Employee Stock Option Pool?

An employee stock option pool (ESOP) is a reserve of company shares that a startup or established company sets aside specifically to grant as stock options to employees, contractors, and advisors. This equity compensation mechanism serves as a powerful tool for attracting and retaining top talent by giving team members a stake in the company's future success.

When a company incorporates, the founders and early investors receive their allocated shares, and a designated portion of the remaining authorized shares is reserved for the option pool. This pool represents a commitment to sharing ownership with the people who will help build the company.

## Why Companies Create Option Pools

Option pools exist because startups and growth-stage companies often cannot compete with established corporations on base salary alone. By offering equity, companies provide:

- **Alignment of interests** — Employees become partial owners, directly benefiting when the company succeeds
- **Talent attraction** — Equity packages help recruit candidates who might otherwise choose higher-paying positions elsewhere
- **Long-term retention** — Vesting schedules encourage employees to stay with the company
- **Cash conservation** — Equity compensation reduces immediate cash outflow for salaries
- **Upside participation** — Employees can share in significant wealth creation if the company grows substantially

## How Stock Options Work

When an employee receives a stock option grant, they obtain the right—but not the obligation—to purchase a specific number of company shares at a predetermined price called the exercise price (or strike price). This price is typically set at the fair market value of the stock on the grant date.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Grant | The initial award of options to an employee |
| Exercise Price | The fixed price at which shares can be purchased |
| Vesting | The process by which options become exercisable over time |
| Exercise | The act of purchasing shares using vested options |
| Fair Market Value | The current assessed value of company shares |

If the company's stock price rises above the exercise price, the employee can exercise their options, purchase shares at the lower strike price, and potentially realize a profit equal to the difference.

## Vesting Schedules

Vesting determines when employees can actually exercise their options. The most common structure in technology companies is the four-year vest with a one-year cliff:

| Vesting Milestone | What Happens |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Before 1-year cliff | No options vest; leaving means forfeiting all options |
| At 1-year cliff | 25% of options vest immediately |
| After cliff | Remaining 75% vests monthly or quarterly over 3 years |
| 4-year completion | 100% of granted options are fully vested |

This structure accomplishes two goals: it protects the company from granting equity to employees who leave quickly, and it provides ongoing incentive for employees to remain with the company.

## Determining Pool Size

The size of an option pool typically ranges from 10% to 20% of the company's total shares, though this varies based on several factors:

- **Company stage** — Earlier-stage companies often need larger pools to compensate for higher risk
- **Industry norms** — Technology companies typically maintain larger pools than companies in other sectors
- **Hiring plans** — Aggressive growth plans require larger reserves
- **Existing compensation** — Companies offering competitive salaries may need smaller equity pools
- **Investor expectations** — Venture capitalists often require specific pool sizes before investing

## Pool Creation and Dilution

Creating or expanding an option pool dilutes existing shareholders proportionally. This is a critical consideration during fundraising, as the timing of pool creation affects who bears the dilution.

| Scenario | Who Bears Dilution |
|----------|-------------------|
| Pool created before financing | Founders and existing shareholders |
| Pool expanded as part of financing | Founders and existing shareholders (pre-money) |
| Pool expanded post-financing | All shareholders including new investors |

Investors typically require that the option pool be established or "topped up" before they invest, meaning their ownership percentage is calculated after the pool is in place. This is known as including the pool in the pre-money valuation.

## Types of Stock Options

Technology professionals should understand the two primary types of stock options used in the United States:

| Type | Full Name | Tax Treatment | Best For |
|------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| ISO | Incentive Stock Option | Potentially favorable capital gains treatment if holding requirements met | Employees |
| NSO | Non-Qualified Stock Option | Taxed as ordinary income at exercise | Employees, contractors, advisors |

ISOs offer potential tax advantages but come with restrictions, including a $100,000 annual limit on the value of options that can vest and requirements for employment status. NSOs are more flexible but typically result in higher tax burdens.

## Key Considerations for Employees

When evaluating a stock option offer, technology professionals should investigate:

- **Percentage ownership** — What portion of the company do your options represent on a fully-diluted basis?
- **409A valuation** — What is the current fair market value, and when was it last assessed?
- **Liquidation preferences** — How much must the company sell for before common shareholders receive proceeds?
- **Exercise window** — How long after leaving do you have to exercise vested options?
- **Early exercise** — Can you exercise unvested options to start the capital gains clock earlier?
- **Company trajectory** — What is the realistic path to liquidity (acquisition, IPO, or other exit)?

## Common Pitfalls

Several issues frequently cause problems with stock options:

- **Expiration risk** — Options typically expire 90 days after employment ends, requiring cash to exercise or forfeiture
- **Tax surprises** — Exercising options can trigger significant tax liabilities, especially with ISOs and AMT
- **Underwater options** — If the exercise price exceeds current value, options have no immediate value
- **Illiquidity** — Private company shares cannot easily be sold, meaning paper wealth may not convert to cash
- **Dilution** — Future financing rounds reduce the percentage ownership each share represents

## The Employee Perspective

For technology professionals, stock options represent both opportunity and risk. They can generate substantial wealth if the company succeeds, but they may also be worthless if the company fails or sells for less than its total raised capital.

Understanding the mechanics of option pools, vesting schedules, and the financial position of the company helps employees make informed decisions about job offers and when to exercise options. The most valuable approach is to view options as potential upside rather than guaranteed compensation, while still negotiating for fair grants based on role, seniority, and market comparisons.
