# Kent Beck Quotations

Question: According to Kent Beck's famous three-phase approach to software development, what is the correct order of priorities when writing code?

- [ ] Make it fast, make it right, make it work
- [ ] Make it right, make it work, make it fast
- [ ] Make it work, make it fast, make it right
- [ ] Make it work, make it right, make it fast

  <p>Make it work, make it right, make it fast</p>
  <p>Kent Beck's pragmatic philosophy emphasizes that developers should first ensure the code functions correctly (make it work), then clean up the design by removing duplication and improving clarity (make it right), and only then optimize for performance if needed (make it fast). This ordering is deliberate because premature optimization—trying to make code fast before it works correctly or is well-designed—leads to complexity that's difficult to maintain. Beck also emphasizes that most code never needs the third phase; clarity and correctness matter more than speed for the majority of systems.</p>
