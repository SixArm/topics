  <p>To understand how work happens, identify inefficiencies, and optimize the workflow</p>
  <p>Workflow analysis is a systematic examination of activities, tasks, and information flow within a process. Its core purpose is to understand how work actually happens, identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement, clarify roles and responsibilities, and ultimately optimize the workflow. While automation, staffing, and compliance documentation may be outcomes of the analysis, they are not its primary purpose.</p>
