  <p>Value-based pricing</p>
  <p>Value-based pricing sets the price based on what the customer is willing to pay for the product or service, rather than on the cost of producing it. This approach focuses on the perceived value to the customer and is commonly used for premium or luxury products where customers associate higher prices with quality, exclusivity, or specific benefits they receive.</p>
