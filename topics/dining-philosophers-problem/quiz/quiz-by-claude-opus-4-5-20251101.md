Question: What is the primary challenge that the Dining Philosophers Problem illustrates in concurrent systems?

- [ ] Memory allocation and garbage collection
- [ ] Synchronization and deadlock prevention
- [ ] Network latency and packet loss
- [ ] Data encryption and security

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Synchronization and deadlock prevention</p>
  <p>The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic example that highlights the challenge of synchronization and deadlock in concurrent systems. It demonstrates how multiple processes competing for shared resources (represented by chopsticks) can lead to deadlock situations where no process can make progress, and how protocols must be designed to coordinate access and prevent such deadlocks.</p>
