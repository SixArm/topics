# Array data structure

Question: What is the primary advantage of arrays that makes them efficient for accessing and manipulating data?

- [ ] Elements can be of different data types within the same array
- [ ] Arrays automatically resize to accommodate new elements
- [ ] Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, enabling fast address calculation
- [ ] Arrays use linked pointers to connect elements

  <p>Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, enabling fast address calculation</p>
  <p>Arrays store elements in contiguous (adjacent) memory locations, which means accessing any element requires only a simple arithmetic calculation based on its index. This provides O(1) constant-time access to any element, making arrays highly efficient for applications requiring frequent and rapid data retrieval.</p>
