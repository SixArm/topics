  <p>Adopting agile practices superficially without understanding their underlying principles</p>
  <p>Cargo cult agile occurs when organizations implement agile terminology, tools, and ceremonies while missing the fundamental mindset shift required. Teams follow prescribed rituals without understanding the reasons why, resulting in the overhead of practices without the benefits. The term draws from post-WWII cargo cults where communities mimicked behaviors without understanding their purpose.</p>
