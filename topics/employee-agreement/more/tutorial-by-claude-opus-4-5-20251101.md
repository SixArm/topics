# Employee Agreement

## Introduction

An employee agreement is a legal contract that establishes the formal relationship between an employer and an employee. For technology professionals, this document carries particular significance because it often contains provisions affecting intellectual property, trade secrets, and post-employment restrictions that can shape your career trajectory.

This agreement serves as the foundational document governing your employment. It defines compensation, responsibilities, and legal obligations binding both parties. Understanding every clause before signing protects your interests and prevents future disputes.

## Core Components of an Employee Agreement

### Employment Details

The employment details section establishes the basic parameters of your working relationship:

- **Job title and reporting structure** - Your official position and who you report to
- **Start date** - The official commencement of employment
- **Work location** - Primary office, remote status, or hybrid arrangements
- **Employment type** - Full-time, part-time, contractor, or at-will status
- **Work hours** - Expected schedule and overtime policies

Technology roles frequently include provisions for on-call duties, after-hours support, or flexible scheduling arrangements that should be explicitly documented.

### Salary and Benefits

Compensation terms require careful review. This section typically covers:

| Component | What to Verify |
|-----------|----------------|
| Base salary | Amount, payment frequency, currency |
| Bonuses | Performance criteria, timing, discretionary vs. guaranteed |
| Equity | Stock options, RSUs, vesting schedule, cliff period |
| Health insurance | Coverage type, employer contribution, dependents |
| Retirement plans | 401(k) matching, vesting schedule |
| Paid time off | Vacation days, sick leave, holidays |
| Professional development | Training budget, conference attendance, certifications |

For technology professionals, equity compensation deserves particular scrutiny. Understand the vesting schedule, exercise windows, and what happens to unvested shares upon departure.

### Roles and Responsibilities

This section defines your job duties and performance expectations. Key elements include:

- Primary responsibilities and day-to-day tasks
- Performance metrics and evaluation criteria
- Reporting relationships and team structure
- Authority levels and decision-making scope
- Expected deliverables and project involvement

Ambiguity in this section can lead to scope creep or disputes about job performance. Ensure the description accurately reflects the position discussed during interviews.

## Protective Clauses for Employers

### Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality

Confidentiality provisions protect the employer's proprietary information. These clauses typically restrict you from:

- Sharing trade secrets, source code, or proprietary algorithms
- Disclosing customer lists, pricing strategies, or business plans
- Revealing internal processes, methodologies, or technical specifications
- Discussing unreleased products or features publicly

Technology professionals handle sensitive information daily. These obligations usually survive employment termination and can extend indefinitely for true trade secrets.

### Intellectual Property Assignment

IP assignment clauses transfer ownership of work-related inventions to the employer. Critical points to understand:

| Aspect | Employer-Favorable | Employee-Favorable |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Scope | All inventions during employment | Only work created using company resources |
| Timing | 24/7 during employment period | Only during work hours |
| Subject matter | Any field related to company business | Only directly related to job duties |
| Prior inventions | Must be disclosed and may be claimed | Explicitly carved out and protected |

Many states, including California, have laws limiting IP assignment to work created within the scope of employment using company resources. Know your jurisdiction's protections.

**Prior inventions disclosure**: List any existing projects, side work, or intellectual property you want to protect before signing. This prevents future disputes about ownership.

### Non-Compete Agreements

Non-compete clauses restrict your ability to work for competitors after leaving. These vary significantly by jurisdiction:

| Jurisdiction Type | Enforceability |
|-------------------|----------------|
| California, North Dakota, Oklahoma | Generally unenforceable |
| Most other U.S. states | Enforceable if reasonable |
| European Union | Varies by country, often require compensation |

When evaluating a non-compete, consider:

- **Geographic scope** - Is it limited to a reasonable area?
- **Duration** - Typically 6 months to 2 years; longer periods face more scrutiny
- **Industry scope** - Does it cover your entire field or specific competitors?
- **Compensation** - Some jurisdictions require payment during the restricted period

The FTC has moved toward limiting non-competes, but enforcement remains jurisdiction-dependent as of 2025.

### Non-Solicitation Provisions

Non-solicitation clauses restrict two types of post-employment activity:

- **Client/customer solicitation** - Prevents you from pursuing the company's customers or business relationships
- **Employee solicitation** - Prevents you from recruiting former colleagues to a new employer

These provisions are generally more enforceable than non-competes because they target specific relationships rather than broadly restricting employment.

## Termination and Severance

### Termination Conditions

Employment can end through various mechanisms:

| Termination Type | Description | Typical Implications |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| At-will | Either party can end employment without cause | No severance obligation |
| For cause | Termination due to misconduct or policy violation | No severance, possible forfeiture of unvested equity |
| Without cause | Company-initiated layoff or position elimination | Often triggers severance provisions |
| Resignation | Employee-initiated departure | Notice period may apply |
| Constructive dismissal | Employee forced to resign due to hostile conditions | May preserve termination rights |

### Severance Terms

Severance packages for technology professionals often include:

- Salary continuation for a specified period
- Accelerated equity vesting
- Extended health insurance coverage (COBRA subsidy)
- Outplacement services
- Reference letter provisions

Severance is frequently contingent on signing a release of claims and reaffirming post-employment obligations.

## Dispute Resolution

### Arbitration Clauses

Many technology companies require binding arbitration for employment disputes. Understand these implications:

- **Waiver of jury trial** - You give up the right to sue in court
- **Limited discovery** - Less access to company documents during disputes
- **Confidential proceedings** - No public record of disputes
- **Cost allocation** - Who pays arbitrator fees
- **Class action waiver** - Often prohibits joining collective actions

Arbitration can favor employers due to repeat-player dynamics, but it also provides faster resolution and privacy.

### Choice of Law and Venue

The agreement specifies which jurisdiction's laws govern disputes and where legal proceedings occur. This matters significantly for:

- Non-compete enforceability
- IP assignment limitations
- Wage and hour protections
- Wrongful termination standards

## Technology-Specific Considerations

### Open Source Contributions

If you contribute to open source projects, clarify:

- Whether company time can be used for approved contributions
- IP ownership of contributions to projects you maintain
- Company policies on starting new open source projects
- Restrictions on contributing to projects that compete with company products

### Side Projects and Moonlighting

Many technology professionals maintain side projects. Negotiate clear terms regarding:

- Definition of competing products or services
- Use of personal time and equipment
- Disclosure requirements for outside work
- Revenue thresholds that trigger notification

### Remote Work Provisions

Remote and hybrid arrangements should address:

- Equipment provision and ownership
- Home office expense reimbursement
- Data security requirements for home networks
- Expectations for availability and response times
- Policies for working from different states or countries

## Negotiating Your Agreement

### Commonly Negotiable Terms

| Term | Negotiation Leverage |
|------|---------------------|
| Base salary | Market data, competing offers |
| Signing bonus | Compensation for forfeited equity elsewhere |
| Equity grants | Seniority of role, startup vs. public company |
| Vesting acceleration | Acquisition or termination scenarios |
| Non-compete scope | Duration, geographic limits, industry definition |
| Severance terms | Months of salary, equity treatment |
| Start date | Reasonable transition time |

### Terms Rarely Negotiable

- Standard confidentiality obligations
- At-will employment status (in most U.S. states)
- Company-wide benefit structures
- Standard arbitration provisions

### Recommended Approach

- **Request review time** - Never sign on the spot; take the document home
- **Ask questions** - Seek clarification on ambiguous language
- **Document verbal promises** - Get any negotiated changes in writing
- **Consider legal review** - For senior roles or unusual provisions, consult an employment attorney
- **Negotiate before signing** - Leverage is highest before you accept

## Red Flags to Watch For

- **Overly broad IP assignment** - Claims to all inventions regardless of relation to work
- **Perpetual non-compete** - Restrictions without reasonable time limits
- **Unilateral modification rights** - Employer can change terms without consent
- **Vague termination for cause** - Undefined misconduct standards
- **Mandatory arbitration with employer-selected arbitrator** - Structural bias concerns
- **No severance provisions** - Leaves you unprotected in layoffs
- **Penalty clauses** - Financial penalties for leaving before specified dates

## Conclusion

An employee agreement defines your professional relationship with your employer and can impact your career for years after you leave. Technology professionals face unique considerations around intellectual property, non-compete restrictions, and equity compensation that require careful attention.

Read every provision before signing. Understand your obligations and rights. Negotiate terms that protect your interests while remaining reasonable to the employer. When in doubt, consult an employment attorney familiar with technology industry practices.

The time invested in understanding your employee agreement protects your career, your creations, and your future opportunities.
