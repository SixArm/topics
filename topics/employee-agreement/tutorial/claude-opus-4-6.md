# Employee agreement

An employee agreement is a legally binding document that establishes the terms and conditions governing the relationship between an employer and an employee. For technology professionals, this agreement is particularly important because it often addresses sensitive matters such as intellectual property ownership, confidentiality of proprietary systems, and restrictions on future employment. Understanding each component of an employee agreement empowers you to negotiate effectively, protect your rights, and enter your role with clear expectations on both sides.

## Purpose and Importance

An employee agreement serves multiple functions. It creates a shared understanding of the employment relationship, reduces the risk of disputes, and provides legal recourse if either party fails to meet its obligations. In the technology sector, where talent mobility is high and intellectual property is a core business asset, these agreements carry outsized significance.

For employers, the agreement protects trade secrets, codifies performance expectations, and establishes enforceable restrictions. For employees, it guarantees compensation, clarifies duties, and defines the boundaries of post-employment obligations. Without a written agreement, both parties are exposed to ambiguity that can lead to costly litigation.

## Core Sections of an Employee Agreement

Every well-drafted employee agreement contains several foundational sections. The following table summarizes the most common components and their purpose.

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Employment details | States the job title, start date, work location, and employment type (full-time, part-time, contract) |
| Salary and benefits | Specifies base compensation, bonus structures, equity grants, healthcare, retirement plans, and paid time off |
| Role and responsibilities | Enumerates job duties, reporting structure, and performance expectations or goals |
| Non-disclosure and confidentiality | Obligates the employee to protect confidential information, trade secrets, and proprietary data |
| Non-compete and non-solicitation | Restricts the employee from competing with the employer or recruiting its clients and staff after departure |
| Intellectual property assignment | Assigns ownership of inventions, code, designs, and other work product created during employment |
| Termination and severance | Defines the conditions for ending the relationship and any severance pay or continuation of benefits |
| Dispute resolution | Establishes the mechanism for resolving disagreements, such as arbitration or mediation |

## Employment Details

This section records the foundational facts of the employment relationship. It typically includes:

- The employee's legal name and the employer's legal entity name
- Job title and department
- Employment start date
- Primary work location or remote work arrangement
- Employment classification (at-will, fixed-term, or indefinite contract)

Technology professionals should pay particular attention to the employment classification. In the United States, most employment is "at-will," meaning either party can terminate the relationship at any time for any lawful reason. Fixed-term contracts, more common in international or consulting contexts, provide greater job security but less flexibility.

## Salary, Benefits, and Equity

Compensation in the technology industry often extends well beyond base salary. A thorough agreement addresses all forms of remuneration.

- **Base salary**: The fixed annual or hourly rate of pay, along with the pay schedule
- **Bonuses**: Performance-based, signing, or retention bonuses, including the conditions that trigger payment
- **Equity compensation**: Stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), or other equity instruments, along with vesting schedules and exercise windows
- **Benefits**: Health insurance, dental and vision coverage, life insurance, disability insurance, and retirement plan contributions
- **Paid time off**: Vacation days, sick leave, personal days, and company holidays
- **Other perks**: Education stipends, home office allowances, wellness programs, and commuter benefits

Vesting schedules deserve special scrutiny. A standard four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff means the employee earns no equity during the first year and then vests incrementally thereafter. Departure before the cliff results in forfeiture of all unvested equity.

## Role, Responsibilities, and Performance

This section translates the job description into contractual terms. It specifies what the employer expects and how performance will be measured. Key elements include:

- A description of primary duties and deliverables
- The reporting chain and supervisory relationships
- Performance review cadence and evaluation criteria
- Expectations around on-call duty, overtime, or travel

For technology roles, the scope of responsibilities should be defined clearly enough to prevent "scope creep" but broadly enough to accommodate the evolving nature of technical work. Vague language such as "and other duties as assigned" is common but should be balanced by explicit core responsibilities.

## Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality

Confidentiality clauses protect the employer's proprietary information. In technology companies, this information may include source code, algorithms, product roadmaps, customer data, financial projections, and internal tooling.

A well-constructed confidentiality clause defines:

- What constitutes "confidential information"
- The employee's obligations to safeguard that information
- Exceptions, such as information that is publicly available or independently developed
- The duration of the confidentiality obligation, which often extends beyond the termination of employment

Technology professionals should understand that confidentiality obligations are typically enforceable even after leaving the company. Sharing proprietary knowledge with a new employer can expose you to significant legal liability.

## Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation

Non-compete clauses restrict an employee from working for a competitor or starting a competing business for a specified period after leaving the company. Non-solicitation clauses prevent the employee from recruiting the company's employees or pursuing its clients.

| Clause Type | Typical Restriction | Common Duration | Enforceability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Non-compete | Prohibits working for competitors within a geographic area or industry | 6 months to 2 years | Varies widely by jurisdiction; banned or limited in California, Colorado, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and other states |
| Non-solicitation of employees | Prohibits recruiting or hiring former colleagues | 1 to 2 years | Generally enforceable if reasonable in scope |
| Non-solicitation of clients | Prohibits pursuing the employer's customers or accounts | 1 to 2 years | Generally enforceable if limited to clients the employee directly served |

Technology professionals in jurisdictions where non-competes are unenforceable, such as California, should still understand these clauses because they may apply if the governing law provision specifies a different state.

## Intellectual Property Assignment

Intellectual property (IP) assignment clauses are among the most consequential provisions for technology workers. These clauses typically assign to the employer all rights to inventions, software, documentation, and creative works produced during the course of employment.

Key considerations include:

- **Scope of assignment**: Does the clause cover only work created during business hours using company resources, or does it extend to all work related to the employer's business regardless of when or where it was created?
- **Prior inventions**: Most agreements include a schedule where the employee can list pre-existing inventions that are excluded from the assignment
- **Open source contributions**: If you contribute to open source projects, clarify whether those contributions fall within the assignment clause
- **Statutory protections**: Some states, including California, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, and Washington, have statutes that limit the scope of IP assignment to work directly related to the employer's business or created using the employer's resources

Failing to disclose prior inventions or to negotiate carve-outs for personal projects can result in the employer claiming ownership of work you created independently.

## Termination and Severance

This section governs how the employment relationship can end and what happens when it does.

- **Voluntary resignation**: The employee's right to leave, typically with a notice period of two weeks (though this is customary rather than legally required in most U.S. states)
- **Termination for cause**: Dismissal due to misconduct, poor performance, or policy violations, usually without severance
- **Termination without cause**: Dismissal for business reasons such as layoffs or restructuring, often accompanied by a severance package
- **Severance terms**: May include continuation of salary, accelerated equity vesting, extended health benefits (COBRA subsidies), and outplacement services
- **Return of property**: Obligations to return equipment, access credentials, and company data upon departure

Severance packages are frequently conditioned on the employee signing a release of claims, waiving the right to sue the employer. Review any release carefully, ideally with an attorney, before signing.

## Dispute Resolution

Many employee agreements require disputes to be resolved through arbitration rather than litigation. Arbitration is a private process in which a neutral third party renders a binding decision. Some agreements also include mediation as a preliminary step.

Key points to evaluate:

- Whether arbitration is mandatory or optional
- Who selects and pays for the arbitrator
- Whether the arbitration clause includes a class action waiver
- The governing law and venue for any legal proceedings

Mandatory arbitration with a class action waiver is common in technology industry agreements. While arbitration can be faster and less expensive than litigation, it also limits discovery rights and typically offers no right of appeal.

## Negotiation Best Practices

Employee agreements are often negotiable, particularly for senior or in-demand technology roles. Consider the following strategies:

- **Read the entire agreement** before signing, including all exhibits and schedules
- **Identify deal-breakers** such as overly broad non-competes or IP assignment clauses that capture personal projects
- **Request modifications in writing** and ensure all agreed changes are reflected in the final signed document
- **Consult an employment attorney** if the agreement contains unusual provisions or if significant compensation is at stake
- **Document prior inventions** thoroughly on the disclosure schedule to preserve ownership of personal work

## Summary

An employee agreement is the legal foundation of the employment relationship, defining compensation, responsibilities, intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations, and post-employment restrictions. For technology professionals, the most consequential provisions are often the IP assignment clause, the non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions, and the confidentiality obligations, all of which can materially affect career mobility and personal projects. A thorough understanding of each section, combined with thoughtful negotiation and legal counsel when appropriate, ensures that you enter the employment relationship with clarity, fairness, and protection for your professional interests.
