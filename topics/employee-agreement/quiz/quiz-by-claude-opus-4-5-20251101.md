  <p>To establish a legal document outlining the terms, conditions, rights, and responsibilities of employment between employer and employee</p>
  <p>An employee agreement is fundamentally a legal document that defines the employment relationship. It covers critical areas such as employment details, salary and benefits, job responsibilities, confidentiality obligations, termination conditions, non-compete clauses, intellectual property assignment, and dispute resolution procedures. For technology professionals, this is especially important as it governs ownership of code and inventions created during employment, protects proprietary information, and clarifies expectations around competitive work.</p>
