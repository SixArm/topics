  <p>Launching early and iterating, even if the product isn't perfect</p>
  <p>Reid Hoffman's quotation emphasizes the lean startup philosophy: getting your product to market quickly to gather real user feedback, rather than waiting until everything is polished. This approach allows entrepreneurs to learn faster, adapt to customer needs, and avoid wasting time building features nobody wants. The "embarrassment" refers to accepting imperfection as a necessary trade-off for speed and learning.</p>
