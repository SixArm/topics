  <p>To create formal ontologies that enable machines to process and reason about domain knowledge</p>
  <p>OWL (Web Ontology Language) is specifically designed to model and represent knowledge by creating ontologies—formal descriptions of concepts and their relationships within a domain. Built on RDF, OWL provides constructs for representing complex relationships and supports inference engines that can reason about the information and draw logical conclusions from ontologies.</p>
