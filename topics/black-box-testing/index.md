# Black-box testing

Black-box testing is when testers evaluate an application's functionality without knowledge of its internal code structure, implementation details, or system architecture. This approach focuses exclusively on examining inputs and outputs, treating the software as a "black box" where only the external behavior is observable and testable.
In contrast, white-box testing focuses on internal code structure.

Black-box testers design test cases based on software specifications, requirements documents, and user stories rather than source code. Common techniques include equivalence partitioning, where input data is divided into valid and invalid groups; boundary value analysis, which tests values at the edges of input ranges; and decision table testing for complex business logic scenarios. Testers also employ error guessing based on experience and intuition about potential failure points.

Automated tools can simulate user interactions, validate outputs against expected results, and perform continuous testing throughout the development lifecycle. Popular automation frameworks like Selenium for web applications, Appium for mobile testing, and API testing tools facilitate comprehensive black-box test automation.

The primary advantages of black-box testing include its independence from implementation details, making it valuable for detecting missing functionality and usability issues. It closely mimics end-user behavior and can be performed by testers without programming expertise. However, limitations include potential gaps in test coverage since internal code paths remain invisible, and the inability to identify specific root causes of failures.
