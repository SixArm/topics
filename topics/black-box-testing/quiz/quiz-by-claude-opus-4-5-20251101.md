  <p>Examining inputs and outputs without knowledge of internal code</p>
  <p>Black-box testing treats the software as a "black box" where only external behavior is observable. Testers evaluate functionality based on specifications, requirements, and user stories rather than source code, focusing exclusively on what the software does (inputs/outputs) rather than how it works internally. This contrasts with white-box testing, which examines internal code structure.</p>
