  <p>The prospective costs and benefits of future actions</p>
  <p>Rational decision-making should be based on prospective costs and benefits of future actions, not past investments that cannot be recovered. The sunk cost fallacy warns against continuing to invest in a project simply because significant resources have already been spent. Instead, decision-makers should evaluate opportunity costs and future potential, disregarding expenses that are already "sunk" and irretrievable.</p>
