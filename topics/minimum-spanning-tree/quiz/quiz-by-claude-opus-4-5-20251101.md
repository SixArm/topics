# Minimum spanning tree (MST)

Question: What is the primary purpose of a minimum spanning tree (MST) in graph theory?

- [ ] To find the longest path between two vertices in a graph
- [ ] To connect all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight while avoiding cycles
- [ ] To determine the maximum flow through a network
- [ ] To identify all possible cycles within a graph

  <p>To connect all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight while avoiding cycles</p>
  <p>A minimum spanning tree is a subset of edges in a connected, undirected graph that connects all vertices together with the minimum possible total edge weight. The resulting tree has no cycles and contains exactly V-1 edges (where V is the number of vertices). MSTs are widely used in network design, clustering, and optimization problems where minimizing connection costs is essential.</p>
