  <p>Partners maintain separate legal identities and autonomy</p>
  <p>A key characteristic of strategic alliances is that participating organizations remain independent entities while collaborating toward shared goals. Unlike mergers or acquisitions where companies combine into a single entity or one absorbs the other, strategic alliance partners retain their separate legal identities, decision-making authority, and ability to pursue other business strategies or partnerships independently.</p>
