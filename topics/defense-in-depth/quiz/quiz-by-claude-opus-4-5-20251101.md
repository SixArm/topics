Question: What is the primary goal of defense in depth in software security?

- [ ] To encrypt all data using a single strong algorithm
- [ ] To create multiple security layers so the system remains protected even if one layer is compromised
- [ ] To block all external network traffic at the firewall
- [ ] To grant minimal access permissions to all users

  <p>To create multiple security layers so the system remains protected even if one layer is compromised</p>
  <p>Defense in depth implements multiple barriers (perimeter security, application security, access control, data encryption, and monitoring) that an attacker would need to penetrate to reach valuable assets. This layered approach ensures the system can continue to function securely even if one or more layers are breached, rather than relying on any single security measure.</p>
