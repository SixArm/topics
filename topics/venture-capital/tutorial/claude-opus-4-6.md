# Venture capital

Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity financing in which investors provide funding to early-stage or growth-stage companies that demonstrate high growth potential. In exchange for capital, venture capitalists receive an ownership stake in the company and typically take an active role in guiding its strategic direction. Venture capital has been instrumental in launching some of the most transformative technology companies in history, and understanding how it works is essential for any technology professional considering fundraising, joining a VC-backed startup, or evaluating the broader startup ecosystem.

## How Venture Capital Works

Venture capital firms raise money from limited partners (LPs), which include institutional investors such as pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals. The VC firm acts as the general partner (GP), making investment decisions on behalf of the fund. Funds typically have a 10-year lifespan: the first few years are devoted to deploying capital into portfolio companies, and the remaining years focus on growing those investments toward an exit event such as an acquisition or initial public offering (IPO).

VCs generate returns through the "power law" dynamic, meaning a small number of highly successful investments are expected to generate the majority of the fund's returns. Because most startups fail, VCs invest in a diversified portfolio and seek outsized returns from the winners to compensate for losses elsewhere.

## Funding Stages

Venture capital investments are typically structured in sequential rounds, each corresponding to a stage of company maturity. The amount of capital, valuation, and expectations increase with each round.

| Stage | Typical Round Size | Purpose | Investors |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-seed | $50K - $500K | Validate idea, build prototype | Angels, accelerators, pre-seed funds |
| Seed | $500K - $3M | Achieve product-market fit, early traction | Seed-stage VCs, angel syndicates |
| Series A | $3M - $15M | Scale product, build team, prove unit economics | Early-stage VCs |
| Series B | $15M - $50M | Accelerate growth, expand markets | Growth-stage VCs |
| Series C and beyond | $50M - $500M+ | Market dominance, international expansion, pre-IPO | Late-stage VCs, crossover funds, private equity |

Each round involves negotiating a valuation (pre-money and post-money), determining the percentage of equity the investors will receive, and establishing governance terms through a term sheet.

## Key Terms and Concepts

Understanding the vocabulary of venture capital is critical when evaluating deals or participating in fundraising.

- **Term sheet**: A non-binding agreement outlining the key terms of an investment, including valuation, investment amount, board composition, and protective provisions.
- **Pre-money valuation**: The value of the company before the new investment is added.
- **Post-money valuation**: The value of the company after the new investment is added (pre-money valuation plus investment amount).
- **Dilution**: The reduction in existing shareholders' ownership percentage when new shares are issued in a funding round.
- **Liquidation preference**: A provision that determines the order and amount investors are paid in the event of a sale, merger, or liquidation of the company.
- **Anti-dilution protection**: A clause that protects investors from dilution if future shares are issued at a lower valuation (a "down round").
- **Pro-rata rights**: The right for existing investors to participate in future funding rounds to maintain their ownership percentage.
- **Cap table**: A capitalization table that tracks who owns what percentage of the company, including founders, employees, and investors.
- **Carried interest**: The share of profits (typically 20%) that the VC general partners earn from the fund's returns.
- **Vesting**: The process by which founders and employees earn their equity over time, usually over four years with a one-year cliff.

## What VCs Look For

Venture capitalists evaluate companies across several dimensions when deciding whether to invest. While every firm has its own thesis and preferences, the following criteria are commonly assessed.

- **Market size**: VCs look for companies targeting large, growing markets — often described as a total addressable market (TAM) of $1 billion or more.
- **Founding team**: The experience, domain expertise, complementary skills, and resilience of the founders are often the most important factor at the early stages.
- **Product differentiation**: A unique technology, proprietary advantage, or novel business model that creates defensibility against competitors.
- **Traction and metrics**: Revenue growth rate, user acquisition, retention rates, unit economics, and other quantitative evidence of product-market fit.
- **Scalability**: The ability to grow revenue significantly without a proportional increase in costs.
- **Exit potential**: A plausible path to a liquidity event — either through IPO or acquisition — that can generate returns for the fund.

## Advantages and Disadvantages for Founders

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|
| Access to significant capital for rapid growth | Dilution of founder ownership and control |
| Strategic guidance from experienced investors | Pressure to grow quickly, sometimes at the expense of sustainability |
| Network access to customers, partners, and talent | Board seats and governance rights can limit founder autonomy |
| Credibility and validation in the market | Misalignment of timelines — VCs need exits within the fund lifecycle |
| Follow-on funding support from existing investors | Fundraising is time-consuming and distracting from building the product |

## The VC Ecosystem

The venture capital landscape includes several types of participants beyond traditional VC firms.

- **Angel investors**: High-net-worth individuals who invest their personal capital, usually at the earliest stages.
- **Accelerators and incubators**: Programs such as Y Combinator, Techstars, and 500 Global that provide seed funding, mentorship, and cohort-based support.
- **Corporate venture capital (CVC)**: Investment arms of large corporations (such as Google Ventures, Intel Capital, or Salesforce Ventures) that invest in startups for strategic and financial reasons.
- **Micro VCs**: Small funds, often under $50 million, that focus on pre-seed and seed investments.
- **Crossover funds**: Large investment firms (such as Tiger Global or Coatue) that invest in both public and private markets, often entering at the late stage.
- **Secondary markets**: Platforms where existing shareholders can sell their equity before an IPO, providing earlier liquidity.

## Venture Capital and Technology

Venture capital has a particularly strong relationship with the technology sector. The capital-intensive nature of building technology platforms, combined with the potential for exponential growth and winner-take-most dynamics, makes technology companies well suited to the VC model. Historically, venture capital has fueled the creation of companies including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, and SpaceX. Today, VC activity is heavily concentrated in areas such as artificial intelligence, enterprise SaaS, fintech, biotech, climate tech, and cybersecurity. For technology professionals, understanding VC dynamics provides insight into why companies make certain strategic decisions, how compensation structures (especially equity) work, and what drives the startup lifecycle.

Technology professionals interested in venture capital should also explore angel investors and how they differ from institutional VCs, private equity and its relationship to later-stage investing, initial public offerings and the IPO process, term sheets and how to negotiate deal terms, cap tables and equity management, startup valuation methods such as discounted cash flow and comparable analysis, accelerators and incubator programs, employee stock options and how vesting works, and due diligence processes from both the investor and founder perspectives.

## Summary

Venture capital is a form of private equity financing that provides high-growth startups with the capital, strategic guidance, and network access needed to scale rapidly. VCs invest in stages from pre-seed through late-stage rounds, taking ownership stakes and board seats in exchange for funding. The model is built on a power-law dynamic where a few breakout successes drive the majority of returns. For technology professionals, understanding venture capital is valuable whether you are founding a company, joining a startup, or simply seeking to understand the economic forces that shape the technology industry. While VC funding can accelerate a company's trajectory, it also introduces dilution, governance constraints, and pressure to achieve exits within a defined timeline — making it a powerful but consequential strategic choice.
