  <p>An ownership stake in the company and often a board seat</p>
  <p>Venture capitalists provide funding in exchange for equity (ownership stake) in the company, typically accompanied by a seat on the board of directors. Unlike traditional loans, VC funding does not require repayment with interest. Instead, VCs earn returns when the company goes public or is acquired, making their investment high-risk but potentially high-reward.</p>
