  <p>NP-hard</p>
  <p>The traveling salesman problem is classified as NP-hard, meaning it is computationally difficult to solve optimally for large input sizes. This is why exact algorithms become impractical for large numbers of cities, and heuristics such as nearest neighbor or genetic algorithms are used to obtain near-optimal solutions instead.</p>
