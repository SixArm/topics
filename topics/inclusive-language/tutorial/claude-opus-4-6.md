# Inclusive language

Inclusive language is the practice of deliberately selecting words, phrases, and expressions that avoid marginalizing or excluding individuals or groups based on characteristics such as gender, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, religion, or socioeconomic background. For technology professionals, inclusive language is particularly relevant because it shapes documentation, codebases, user interfaces, team communication, and corporate culture. Adopting inclusive language is not about policing speech; it is about making conscious choices that foster clarity, respect, and belonging across diverse teams and user bases.

## Why Inclusive Language Matters in Technology

The technology industry operates globally, with teams and users spanning cultures, languages, and identities. Language embedded in code, documentation, APIs, and user-facing content reaches millions of people. When that language carries bias or exclusion, it can alienate contributors, discourage participation, and erode trust.

Several major organizations have recognized this. In recent years, companies including Google, Microsoft, Apple, and the Linux kernel project have updated their style guides and codebases to replace exclusionary terminology. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) published guidance recommending alternatives to terms like "master/slave" and "whitelist/blacklist." These changes reflect a growing consensus that inclusive language is a professional standard, not merely a preference.

## Benefits of Inclusive Language

- **Promoting inclusivity**: Inclusive language creates an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued, regardless of background or identity. This is especially important in open-source communities and global engineering teams.
- **Reducing bias**: Conscious language choices help counteract unconscious bias and stereotypes that can influence hiring, code reviews, and product design.
- **Improving communication**: Neutral, precise language reduces ambiguity and ensures that all participants understand the conversation without needing to decode culturally specific or loaded terminology.
- **Increasing understanding**: Inclusive language encourages respect for different cultures, backgrounds, and identities, which strengthens cross-functional and cross-cultural collaboration.
- **Building trust**: Teams that communicate inclusively foster psychological safety, making it easier for members to contribute ideas, raise concerns, and take risks.

## Common Terminology Replacements

The following table lists terms commonly found in technology contexts alongside their recommended inclusive alternatives.

| Legacy Term | Inclusive Alternative | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| master/slave | primary/replica, leader/follower, main/secondary | Removes language rooted in human subjugation |
| whitelist/blacklist | allowlist/blocklist, accept/reject | Avoids associating "white" with good and "black" with bad |
| guys, ladies and gentlemen | everyone, team, folks, all | Uses gender-neutral group address |
| sanity check | confidence check, coherence check, quick review | Avoids trivializing mental health conditions |
| dummy value | placeholder value, sample value | Removes potentially demeaning language |
| grandfathered | legacy, exempt, pre-existing | Removes reference to discriminatory grandfather clauses |
| man-hours | person-hours, engineering hours, labor hours | Uses gender-neutral measurement |
| crippled | degraded, limited, reduced | Avoids language that devalues people with disabilities |
| native feature | built-in feature, core feature | Avoids potentially loaded cultural connotations |
| best practices | recommended practices, established practices, our practices | Promotes accountability and acknowledges context-dependence |

## Categories of Inclusive Language

Inclusive language spans several dimensions. Technology professionals should be aware of each category and the principles behind it.

- **Gender-inclusive language**: Use "they/them" as a singular pronoun when gender is unknown or irrelevant. Prefer role titles such as "chairperson" over "chairman" and "firefighter" over "fireman." In user interfaces, offer inclusive options for gender fields or allow free-text entry rather than limiting to a binary choice.
- **Disability-inclusive language**: Use person-first language such as "person with a disability" rather than "disabled person," unless the individual or community prefers identity-first language (as is common in the Deaf and autistic communities). Avoid metaphors that trivialize conditions, such as "blind spot" when "oversight" works equally well.
- **Culturally inclusive language**: Avoid idioms and metaphors that assume a particular cultural context. Phrases like "low-hanging fruit" or "hit the ground running" may not translate well across languages and cultures. Prefer direct, literal language in global documentation.
- **Orientation-inclusive language**: Use "partner" or "spouse" instead of assuming "husband" or "wife." Do not assume heteronormative relationships in user interface design or documentation examples.
- **Socioeconomically inclusive language**: Avoid assumptions about users' access to resources. Phrases like "just buy a new device" or "everyone has high-speed internet" exclude users with limited means.

## Applying Inclusive Language in Practice

Adopting inclusive language requires more than a find-and-replace operation. It involves building awareness and establishing processes that sustain the practice over time.

- **Style guides**: Establish or adopt a writing style guide that includes inclusive language standards. Google's developer documentation style guide, Microsoft's writing style guide, and the Conscious Style Guide are strong starting points.
- **Code review**: Include inclusive language as a criterion in code review checklists. Linters and automated tools can flag known exclusionary terms in code and documentation.
- **User interface audits**: Review labels, error messages, onboarding flows, and help text for assumptions about gender, ability, culture, or access.
- **Onboarding and training**: Incorporate inclusive language guidance into new employee onboarding and ongoing professional development.
- **Feedback mechanisms**: Create channels where team members and users can flag exclusionary language without fear of retaliation. Treat these reports as opportunities to improve, not as personal criticism.
- **Iteration**: Language evolves. Terms considered acceptable today may become outdated. Commit to periodic review and update of terminology across codebases, documentation, and communications.

## Challenges and Considerations

Transitioning to inclusive language is not without friction. Technology professionals may encounter several challenges.

- **Legacy systems and APIs**: Renaming terms in established APIs, database schemas, or configuration files can introduce breaking changes. A phased approach with deprecation notices and aliasing can ease the transition.
- **Resistance to change**: Some team members may view inclusive language as unnecessary or performative. Framing the change in terms of professionalism, clarity, and global reach can help address skepticism.
- **Context dependence**: Not every term has a single correct replacement. The best alternative depends on the domain, audience, and specific usage. "Primary/replica" may suit database terminology, while "leader/follower" may better fit distributed systems.
- **Overcorrection**: Inclusive language should enhance clarity, not obscure meaning. Replacing well-understood technical terms with vague alternatives can harm usability. The goal is precision and respect, not euphemism.

## Summary

Inclusive language is a deliberate, evolving practice of choosing words that respect and include all people. For technology professionals, it applies across codebases, documentation, user interfaces, and team communication. The core principle is straightforward: use language that is precise, respectful, and free of unnecessary bias. By establishing style guides, integrating inclusive language into review processes, and remaining open to feedback and change, technology teams can build products and cultures that welcome the widest possible range of contributors and users.
