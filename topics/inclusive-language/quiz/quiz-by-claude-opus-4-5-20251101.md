# Inclusive language

Question: In technology contexts, which term pair represents an inclusive language alternative to traditionally exclusionary terminology?

- [ ] "Primary/secondary" instead of "server/client"
- [ ] "Accept/reject" instead of "whitelist/blacklist"
- [ ] "Input/output" instead of "read/write"
- [ ] "Enable/disable" instead of "on/off"

  <p>Accept/reject instead of whitelist/blacklist</p>
  <p>The terms "whitelist" and "blacklist" have been identified as exclusionary because they associate "white" with positive/allowed and "black" with negative/blocked. Inclusive alternatives like "accept list/reject list" or "allow list/deny list" convey the same technical meaning without reinforcing racial connotations. This is a widely adopted change in technology documentation and codebases to promote more respectful and welcoming environments.</p>
