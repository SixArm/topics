# Inclusive Language

## Introduction

Inclusive language refers to communication choices that consciously avoid words, phrases, and expressions that marginalize or exclude individuals or groups based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age, or other characteristics. For technology professionals, inclusive language applies across documentation, code comments, variable naming, user interfaces, team communications, and public-facing content.

The goal is straightforward: create a respectful, welcoming environment where all colleagues, users, and stakeholders feel valued. This is not about political correctness—it is about clear, precise communication that does not alienate portions of your audience.

## Why Inclusive Language Matters in Technology

Technology products reach global audiences with diverse backgrounds. The words chosen in interfaces, documentation, and code affect how people perceive both the product and the organization behind it.

**Business Impact:**
- Products using inclusive language have broader market appeal
- Teams practicing inclusive communication report higher collaboration and retention
- Companies face reputational and legal risks from exclusionary language

**Technical Impact:**
- Clearer terminology often results in more precise documentation
- Inclusive naming conventions can improve code readability
- Avoiding jargon-laden or culturally specific idioms makes content more accessible to international teams

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **People-first language** | Describe the person before the characteristic (e.g., "person with a disability" rather than "disabled person") |
| **Avoid assumptions** | Do not presume gender, relationship status, family structure, or ability |
| **Use specificity** | Replace vague or loaded terms with precise alternatives |
| **Respect self-identification** | Use the terms individuals and communities use for themselves |
| **Update legacy terminology** | Replace outdated terms in code and documentation when practical |

## Common Substitutions in Technology

### Technical Terminology

| Avoid | Use Instead | Rationale |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| master/slave | primary/replica, leader/follower, main/secondary | Removes references to human bondage |
| whitelist/blacklist | allowlist/denylist, permit list/block list | Removes racial connotations |
| sanity check | validation check, confidence check, coherence check | Avoids stigmatizing mental health |
| dummy value | placeholder value, sample value | More precise terminology |
| crippled | limited, restricted, reduced functionality | Avoids ableist language |
| grandfathered | legacy, exempt, pre-existing | Removes reference to discriminatory voting laws |

### Gender-Inclusive Language

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| guys, ladies and gentlemen | everyone, folks, team, all |
| he/she (as generic) | they, the user, the developer |
| man-hours | person-hours, staff-hours, engineering hours |
| manpower | workforce, staffing, personnel |
| chairman | chairperson, chair |
| fireman, policeman | firefighter, police officer |

### Ability-Inclusive Language

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| blind to (as metaphor) | unaware of, ignoring |
| deaf to (as metaphor) | ignoring, dismissing |
| lame | inadequate, weak, unconvincing |
| crazy, insane | unexpected, surprising, intense |
| tone-deaf | insensitive, unaware |

## Practical Applications

### In Code and Technical Documentation

- **Variable and function names**: Use `primaryDatabase` instead of `masterDatabase`
- **Configuration files**: Use `allowedIPs` instead of `whitelistedIPs`
- **Comments**: Write "validate input" instead of "sanity check input"
- **Error messages**: Be specific and neutral—"Invalid input format" rather than "Are you blind?"

### In User Interfaces

- **Forms**: Offer inclusive options for gender (including "prefer not to say" or custom input)
- **Avatars**: Provide diverse default options rather than defaulting to one demographic
- **Examples**: Use varied names reflecting different cultures and genders
- **Pronouns**: Allow users to specify pronouns in profiles where relevant

### In Team Communication

- **Meetings**: Say "Has everyone had a chance to speak?" rather than "Do the ladies have anything to add?"
- **Feedback**: Focus on work product, not personal characteristics
- **Documentation**: Use "the developer" or "they" rather than assuming "he"
- **Job postings**: Avoid gendered language like "rockstar" or "ninja" that research shows discourages diverse applicants

## Benefits of Inclusive Language

- **Promoting inclusivity**: Creates environments where everyone feels welcome regardless of background or identity
- **Reducing bias**: Decreases unconscious bias and stereotypes embedded in everyday communication
- **Improving communication**: Ensures all participants understand and feel included in conversations
- **Increasing understanding**: Builds respect for different cultures, backgrounds, and identities
- **Building trust**: Fosters positive relationships among individuals and teams
- **Improving clarity**: Often results in more precise, descriptive terminology

## Implementation Strategy

### For Individuals

1. Audit your own communication patterns
2. Learn preferred terminology from affected communities
3. Accept corrections gracefully and adjust
4. Update documentation and code as you encounter outdated terms

### For Teams

1. Establish style guides with inclusive language standards
2. Add linting rules for terminology in code reviews
3. Update templates and boilerplate text
4. Create a shared glossary of preferred terms

### For Organizations

1. Conduct audits of public-facing content
2. Update brand guidelines and style documentation
3. Provide training resources
4. Include inclusive language in onboarding materials
5. Set timelines for deprecating legacy terminology in codebases

## Common Objections and Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "It's just words" | Words shape perception and culture; small changes compound |
| "This is too much effort" | Most changes are one-time updates; new habits form quickly |
| "Technical terms are standard" | Standards evolve; major projects like Git have already adopted new terminology |
| "No one is actually offended" | You may not hear from those who feel excluded—they often simply leave |
| "This is political" | Clear, respectful communication is professional, not political |

## Industry Adoption

Major technology organizations have already made these transitions:

- **Git/GitHub**: Changed default branch from "master" to "main"
- **Python**: Removed "master/slave" terminology from documentation
- **Django**: Updated documentation and code to use inclusive alternatives
- **Apple, Google, Microsoft**: Published inclusive language guidelines for developers
- **IETF**: Published guidelines recommending alternatives to exclusionary terminology

## Conclusion

Inclusive language is a professional communication standard, not an optional nicety. For technology professionals, it applies to code, documentation, interfaces, and interpersonal communication. The substitutions are straightforward, the benefits are measurable, and the industry has broadly adopted these practices.

Start with awareness, make incremental changes, and build inclusive communication into your standard workflows. The result is clearer communication, broader reach, and a more welcoming environment for everyone who interacts with your work.
