  <p>Using a textual syntax in plain text files</p>
  <p>PlantUML is an open-source tool that allows you to create diagrams using a textual syntax. You write diagram descriptions in plain text files using keywords and symbols, and PlantUML processes these files to generate visual diagrams in formats like PNG, SVG, or PDF. This text-based approach enables version control, easy collaboration, and programmatic diagram generation.</p>
