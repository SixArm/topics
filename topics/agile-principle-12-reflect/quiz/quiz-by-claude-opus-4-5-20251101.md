  <p>Committing to actually implement changes based on insights gained during reflection</p>
  <p>According to the principle, identifying issues alone is insufficient. Teams must be willing to adjust their behavior, try new techniques, or abandon practices that aren't serving them well. This commitment to action—combined with psychological safety for honest feedback—creates a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, enabling teams to self-organize and self-improve.</p>
