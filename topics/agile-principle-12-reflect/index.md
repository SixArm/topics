# Agile principle 12: Reflect

"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."

This principle emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement through adaptation. Teams that embrace this practice examine their processes, collaboration patterns, and outcomes. Rather than simply pushing forward without consideration, they create space for honest assessment of what's working well and what needs adjustment.

The reflection process typically involves the entire team discussing their recent experiences, identifying bottlenecks, celebrating successes, and acknowledging areas for improvement. This isn't merely complaining about problems but actively seeking solutions and experimenting with new approaches. Teams might examine their communication methods, development practices, tool usage, or meeting structures to find opportunities for enhancement.

The key to this principle's effectiveness lies in the commitment to actually implement changes based on insights gained during reflection. It's not enough to identify issues; teams must be willing to adjust their behavior, try new techniques, or abandon practices that aren't serving them well. This requires psychological safety where team members feel comfortable sharing honest feedback without fear of blame or retribution.

This reflection and adjustment creates a culture of learning and adaptation. Teams become more resilient and responsive to changing requirements, technical challenges, and evolving business needs. They develop the ability to self-organize and self-improve rather than relying solely on external management to drive change.
