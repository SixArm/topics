# Agile principle 12: Reflect

"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."

This agile principle emphasizes continuous improvement through regular team reflection and adaptation. Teams typically implement this through retrospective meetings held at the end of each sprint or iteration, where they examine what worked well, what didn't, and what changes they should make moving forward.

The key is making retrospectives actionable rather than just complaint sessions. Successful teams identify specific, measurable improvements and commit to trying them for a set period. They might experiment with new tools, adjust their meeting structures, or modify their definition of done. This continuous cycle of reflection and adjustment helps teams evolve their practices based on real experience rather than assumptions, leading to sustained improvements in productivity and team satisfaction.

Teams also use this principle to address collaboration challenges. For instance, a distributed team at GitHub found through retrospectives that asynchronous communication was causing delays. They adjusted their behavior by establishing core overlap hours and implementing better documentation practices, improving their velocity by 25%.

A real-world example comes from Spotify's engineering teams, who conduct weekly retrospectives where they discuss technical challenges, communication issues, and process improvements. When one team discovered that their code review process was creating bottlenecks, they experimented with pair programming sessions and automated testing tools, ultimately reducing their review time by 40% and improving code quality.

Another practical application involves teams at companies like Netflix, where development teams regularly assess their deployment practices. After experiencing several production issues, one team's retrospective revealed that their manual deployment process was error-prone. They decided to invest time in automated deployment pipelines, which significantly reduced deployment errors and allowed for more frequent releases.
