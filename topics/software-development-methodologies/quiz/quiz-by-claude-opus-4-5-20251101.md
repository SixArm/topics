# Software development methodologies

Question: Which methodology is specifically designed to minimize risk through multiple iterations of planning, designing, building, and testing, making it particularly suited for large, complex projects?

- [ ] Waterfall
- [ ] Rapid Application Development (RAD)
- [ ] Spiral Model
- [ ] Lean Development

  <p>Spiral Model</p>
  <p>The Spiral Model emphasizes risk analysis and mitigation through multiple iterations of planning, designing, building, and testing. Unlike Waterfall (which is linear and sequential), RAD (which prioritizes rapid prototyping), or Lean (which focuses on minimizing waste), the Spiral Model is specifically designed to handle large, complex projects with high levels of risk by addressing potential issues early in each iteration cycle.</p>
