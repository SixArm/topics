  <p>To identify what worked well, what didn't work well, and recommend improvements for the future</p>
  <p>An AAR is a structured review conducted after an event or project is completed. Its core purpose is continuous improvement through honest evaluation—gathering feedback from stakeholders, analyzing strengths and weaknesses (often using SWOT analysis), and developing actionable recommendations. The focus is on learning and improving future performance, not on assigning blame or creating legal documentation.</p>
