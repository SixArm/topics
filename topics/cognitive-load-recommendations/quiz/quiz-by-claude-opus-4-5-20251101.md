  <p>To present information and options gradually, only when needed, to avoid overwhelming users</p>
  <p>Progressive disclosure is a key technique for reducing cognitive load by revealing information and options incrementally rather than all at once. This approach prevents users from being overwhelmed with too many choices or details, allowing them to focus on the immediate task while still having access to additional functionality when they need it.</p>
