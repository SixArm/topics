  <p>Applying scientific principles to study and optimize work processes for increased efficiency</p>
  <p>Scientific management, developed by Taylor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, is fundamentally based on applying scientific methods—such as time and motion studies, standardization, and systematic analysis—to work processes. The goal is to identify the most efficient ways to perform tasks, eliminate waste, and maximize productivity. This approach includes breaking down work into specialized tasks, selecting workers based on aptitude, providing clear instructions, and using incentive systems tied to output.</p>
