  <p>The level of risk that exists before any control measures are implemented</p>
  <p>Inherent risk refers to the vulnerability that exists in a process, activity, or business environment before any mitigating controls or risk management measures are in place. Understanding inherent risk is essential for technology professionals because it provides a baseline for risk assessment, helps prioritize which risks need the most attention, and guides decisions about what controls are necessary to reduce exposure to an acceptable level.</p>
