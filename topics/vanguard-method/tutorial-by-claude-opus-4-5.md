# Vanguard Method: Tutorial

## Overview

The Vanguard Method is a change management approach developed by John Seddon that challenges traditional top-down change initiatives by focusing on understanding work as a system from the customer's perspective. In the context of software engineering and agile change, the Vanguard Method is particularly valuable because it prevents organizations from automating or digitizing fundamentally flawed processes. Its systems thinking foundation and emphasis on understanding demand before designing supply ensure that technology investments address root causes rather than symptoms of systemic problems. For agile change professionals, this methodology provides a rigorous, evidence-based framework for ensuring that change efforts create genuine value.

## Key Concepts

### Systems Thinking Foundation

The Vanguard Method is grounded in systems thinking -- the discipline of understanding organizations as interconnected systems rather than collections of isolated departments or processes. Problems are understood as arising from the design of the system, not from individual failures. This perspective is critical for change professionals because it redirects attention from blaming individuals to redesigning the systems that produce undesirable outcomes.

### Understanding Demand Before Designing Supply

A distinguishing characteristic of the Vanguard Method is its insistence on thoroughly understanding demand -- what customers actually need and how they interact with the organization -- before designing solutions. This prevents the common mistake of building technology solutions that optimize the wrong processes or automate workflows that should not exist in their current form.

### Value Demand vs. Failure Demand

The method introduces the crucial distinction between value demand (requests from customers that the organization exists to serve) and failure demand (requests caused by the system's inability to do something right the first time). Failure demand represents systemic waste -- customers calling back because their issue was not resolved, rework caused by errors, or workarounds needed because the system does not meet actual needs. Understanding this distinction is foundational to effective change.

### Three Phases of the Vanguard Method

**Phase 1: Check (Study the System).** Leaders and teams examine current workflows, identify value and waste, and understand actual customer demand versus organizational assumptions. This phase reveals how existing systems often create failure demand. The study is conducted from the customer's perspective, not from an internal operational perspective.

**Phase 2: Plan (Design Against Demand).** Based on the empirical evidence gathered during Phase 1, teams design changes that address actual demand patterns and remove sources of waste and failure demand. Changes are designed incrementally and measured against purpose and customer value rather than arbitrary targets or internal metrics.

**Phase 3: Do (Implement as Experiments).** Changes are implemented as experiments, maintaining flexibility to adjust based on real-world results. This contrasts with traditional change programs that follow predetermined plans regardless of emerging evidence. The experimental approach ensures that solutions are validated against actual outcomes before being scaled.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Commit to studying the system before changing it.** Resist the organizational pressure to jump directly to solutions. Dedicate time and resources to understanding how work actually flows through the system, from the customer's initial contact to the final resolution of their need.

2. **Study demand from the customer's perspective.** Observe and categorize incoming demand. For each customer interaction, ask: Is this value demand (the customer wants something the organization exists to provide) or failure demand (the customer is contacting us because something went wrong)?

3. **Quantify failure demand.** Measure the proportion of total demand that is failure demand. In many organizations, failure demand can represent 40-80% of total workload. This measurement provides a compelling baseline for change and reveals the magnitude of systemic waste.

4. **Map the end-to-end system.** Document how work flows from customer request to resolution, including all handoffs, decision points, delays, and rework loops. Identify where value is created and where waste accumulates.

5. **Identify root causes of failure demand.** For each category of failure demand, trace the root cause back through the system. Common root causes include inadequate initial response, poor communication between departments, rigid standardized procedures that do not accommodate customer variety, and systems designed around internal convenience rather than customer needs.

6. **Design changes against demand patterns.** Based on your understanding of actual demand, redesign workflows to handle the variety of customer needs effectively. Design systems that absorb variety rather than forcing customers into standardized processes that do not fit their needs.

7. **Remove sources of failure demand.** Prioritize changes that eliminate the root causes of failure demand. Reducing failure demand simultaneously improves customer experience and frees organizational capacity for value-creating work.

8. **Implement changes as experiments.** Roll out changes incrementally and treat each change as an experiment. Define what you expect to happen, measure actual results, and adjust based on evidence. Do not commit to large-scale rollouts before validating that changes work as intended.

9. **Measure against purpose and customer value.** Replace arbitrary targets and internal activity metrics with measures that reflect whether the system is achieving its purpose and delivering what customers value. Ask: Are we solving customer problems effectively? Is failure demand decreasing?

10. **Iterate and expand.** As experiments validate improvements, expand successful changes to broader scope. Continue studying the system, because changes in one area often reveal new improvement opportunities in connected areas.

## Key Takeaway

The central lesson of the Vanguard Method for agile change professionals is that effective change begins with deeply understanding the current system -- especially the patterns of demand it faces and the waste it creates -- before designing solutions. By distinguishing between value demand and failure demand, studying work from the customer's perspective, and implementing changes as evidence-based experiments, organizations avoid the common trap of automating or optimizing broken processes. The result is change that addresses root causes, reduces systemic waste, and creates genuine value for customers and the organization alike.
