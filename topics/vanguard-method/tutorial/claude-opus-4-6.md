# Vanguard Method

The Vanguard Method is a systems-thinking approach to organizational change developed by John Seddon, founder of Vanguard Consulting. It challenges conventional management practices by insisting that leaders study their organization as a system from the customer's perspective before making any changes. Rather than imposing top-down transformation programs or rushing to automate existing processes, the method demands empirical understanding of how work actually flows, what customers truly need, and where systemic dysfunction generates unnecessary demand. For technology professionals, this methodology is particularly valuable because it prevents the common and costly mistake of digitizing broken processes, ensuring that software engineering efforts solve the right problems.

## Origins and Philosophy

John Seddon developed the Vanguard Method in the 1980s and 1990s, drawing heavily on the work of W. Edwards Deming and Taiichi Ohno. Seddon observed that most organizational change programs failed because they addressed symptoms rather than root causes. His central insight was that management thinking itself, not frontline workers or tooling, was the primary source of poor performance. The method emerged from applying systems thinking to service organizations, where traditional manufacturing-oriented lean approaches often fell short.

The philosophy rests on a fundamental premise: you cannot improve what you do not understand. Leaders must engage directly with the work, studying it empirically before designing interventions. This "check-plan-do" sequence deliberately inverts the conventional "plan-do-check" cycle, arguing that planning without first understanding the system produces solutions that entrench existing problems.

## Core Principles

The Vanguard Method is built on several interconnected principles that guide how organizations study and redesign their work.

- **Purpose from the customer's perspective.** Every system exists to serve a purpose, and that purpose must be defined from the outside in. Technology teams often define purpose in terms of deliverables or features, but the Vanguard Method insists on articulating purpose as the customer experiences it.

- **Demand analysis before solution design.** Understanding what customers actually want, and distinguishing that from demand the system itself creates, is the essential first step. No technology investment should proceed without this analysis.

- **Study the work as a system.** Individual processes, departments, or components cannot be understood or optimized in isolation. The method demands that leaders trace work end to end, across organizational boundaries.

- **Management thinking drives system performance.** Policies, targets, procedures, and incentive structures, all products of management thinking, shape how work is done. Changing the work without changing the thinking produces only temporary improvements.

- **Measures derived from purpose.** Metrics should reflect whether the system is achieving its purpose, not whether individuals are hitting arbitrary targets. Activity-based metrics such as tickets closed or lines of code written actively distort system performance.

## The Three Phases

The Vanguard Method proceeds through three distinct phases: Check, Plan, and Do. Each phase has a specific function and set of activities.

### Phase 1: Check

This is the diagnostic phase where leaders study the current system. Teams map actual work flows, observe how demand enters the system, and measure capability against purpose. The critical activity here is classifying demand into value demand and failure demand. Leaders also identify the management conditions, such as targets, functional silos, and standard procedures, that produce the current performance. This phase often reveals that a large proportion of work is waste generated by the system itself.

### Phase 2: Plan

Using evidence from the Check phase, the team redesigns the system. The redesign targets the elimination of failure demand and the removal of systemic waste. New measures are created that relate directly to purpose. Importantly, the redesign is not a comprehensive blueprint but a directional framework that will be tested and refined. Technology decisions made during this phase are grounded in observed demand patterns rather than assumptions or vendor promises.

### Phase 3: Do

Changes are implemented as experiments. Teams test redesigned processes, measure results against purpose, and iterate. This phase maintains flexibility: if an experiment does not produce the expected improvement, it is adjusted or abandoned. The experimental approach contrasts sharply with traditional change programs that commit to a fixed plan and measure compliance rather than outcomes.

## Value Demand vs. Failure Demand

One of the most influential concepts introduced by the Vanguard Method is the distinction between value demand and failure demand. This distinction is critical for technology professionals who are designing systems, building software, or managing service operations.

| Demand Type | Definition | Examples in Technology |
|---|---|---|
| Value demand | Demand that represents what the customer actually wants and the organization exists to provide | A user requesting a new feature that solves a genuine need; a customer placing an order through a well-designed interface |
| Failure demand | Demand caused by a failure to do something or do something right for the customer | A user calling support because the system lost their data; repeated follow-up requests because the first response was incomplete; rework caused by unclear requirements |

Studies applying the Vanguard Method in service organizations routinely find that failure demand accounts for 40% to 80% of all incoming work. In technology contexts, failure demand manifests as bug reports caused by poor upstream processes, support tickets generated by confusing interfaces, and rework driven by misunderstood requirements. Eliminating failure demand at its source, rather than building faster systems to process it, produces dramatic improvements in capacity, cost, and customer satisfaction.

## Vanguard Method vs. Traditional Approaches

The Vanguard Method diverges from conventional change methodologies in several important ways. The following comparison highlights the key differences.

| Dimension | Traditional Approach | Vanguard Method |
|---|---|---|
| Starting point | Plan based on assumptions and benchmarks | Study the system empirically before acting |
| Change sequence | Plan, Do, Check | Check, Plan, Do |
| Unit of analysis | Individual processes or departments | The end-to-end system |
| Role of targets | Central to performance management | Rejected as distorting; replaced with capability measures |
| Measures | Activity and output metrics | Purpose-based measures derived from customer value |
| Implementation | Big-bang rollout or phased program | Experimental, iterative, adjustable |
| Management role | Sponsors and overseers of change programs | Active participants who study and redesign the work |
| Technology role | Enabler of predetermined solutions | Tool selected after system understanding is achieved |
| Attitude to failure demand | Manage it efficiently | Eliminate it at the source |

## Implications for Technology Professionals

The Vanguard Method has direct and practical consequences for how technology teams operate.

- **Requirements gathering changes fundamentally.** Instead of collecting feature requests from stakeholders, technology teams participate in studying the system. Requirements emerge from observed demand patterns and measured capability gaps, not from opinion or assumption.

- **Automation decisions become evidence-based.** The method prevents premature automation. If a process generates significant failure demand, automating it simply produces failure faster. The system must be redesigned first, then technology applied to the redesigned flow.

- **Metrics and dashboards require rethinking.** Activity-based dashboards that track throughput, velocity, or utilization are replaced with capability charts that show whether the system is achieving its purpose over time. Technology teams building reporting tools must understand this distinction.

- **Organizational silos become visible obstacles.** End-to-end system study reveals how functional boundaries create handoffs, delays, and information loss. Technology architecture decisions, such as choosing between monolithic and service-oriented designs, benefit from this systemic perspective.

- **Continuous improvement becomes genuine.** Rather than pursuing improvement through periodic transformation programs, the Vanguard Method embeds learning and adaptation into daily work. Technology teams accustomed to agile retrospectives will recognize this principle, but the Vanguard Method applies it at the system level rather than the team level.

## Criticisms and Limitations

The Vanguard Method is not without its critics. Some common objections include:

- **It requires significant leadership commitment.** The Check phase demands that senior leaders personally study the work, which many executives resist as too time-consuming or beneath their role.
- **It can be slow to start.** Organizations under pressure for rapid results may find the diagnostic phase frustrating, particularly when stakeholders expect immediate action.
- **It challenges deeply held management beliefs.** The rejection of targets, incentives, and functional specialization conflicts with mainstream management practice, creating organizational resistance.
- **Its evidence base is primarily from service organizations.** While the principles are broadly applicable, most published case studies come from local government and service sectors rather than technology companies.

Despite these limitations, the method's emphasis on empirical study and systemic understanding provides a rigorous foundation for change that avoids the waste and disappointment of uninformed transformation programs.

## Related

Technology professionals interested in the Vanguard Method should explore systems thinking as a broader discipline, including the work of W. Edwards Deming on variation and management theory, and Taiichi Ohno's contributions to lean manufacturing. The concepts of value stream mapping, failure demand analysis, and theory of constraints complement the Vanguard Method directly. Practitioners working in agile environments will benefit from comparing the method with Kanban's emphasis on flow and work-in-progress limits, as well as the Cynefin framework's approach to understanding problem complexity. Those in service management should also examine ITIL and DevOps through the lens of systems thinking to understand where those frameworks align with or diverge from the Vanguard Method's principles.

## Summary

The Vanguard Method is a systems-thinking approach to organizational change that insists on empirical study before action. By demanding that leaders understand demand, distinguish value from failure demand, and redesign systems against purpose rather than arbitrary targets, it provides a rigorous alternative to conventional change programs. For technology professionals, the method offers a powerful corrective to the instinct to automate first and ask questions later, ensuring that software and systems investments address genuine customer needs rather than perpetuating systemic dysfunction.
