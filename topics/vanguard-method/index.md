# Vanguard Method

The Vanguard Method is a change management approach in software engineering that emphasizes understanding the true purpose and demand patterns of organizational systems before implementing technological solutions. Developed by John Seddon, this methodology challenges traditional top-down change initiatives by focusing on studying work as a system from the customer's perspective.

What distinguishes the Vanguard Method from other chamge approaches is its systems thinking foundation and emphasis on understanding demand before designing supply. This prevents organizations from automating or digitizing fundamentally flawed processes, ensuring that software engineering efforts address root causes rather than symptoms of systemic problems.

- Phase 1 is where leaders examine current work flows, identify value and waste, and understand actual customer demand versus organizational assumptions. This phase reveals how existing systems often create failure demand - work caused by the system's inability to do something right the first time. 

- Phase 2 involves designing changes based on empirical evidence gathered during system study. The method emphasizes designing against demand patterns and removing sources of waste and failure demand. Changes are implemented incrementally, with continuous measurement against purpose and customer value rather than arbitrary targets or metrics.

- Phase 3 implements changes as experiments, maintaining flexibility to adjust based on real-world results. This contrasts with traditional change programs that follow predetermined plans regardless of emerging evidence.
