  <p>To identify work caused by the system's inability to do something right the first time</p>
  <p>The Vanguard Method emphasizes understanding failure demand—work that exists because the system failed to meet customer needs correctly initially. By identifying failure demand in Phase 1, organizations can address root causes of systemic problems rather than simply automating or digitizing flawed processes. This prevents technology solutions from perpetuating inefficiencies and ensures that software engineering efforts create genuine value from the customer's perspective.</p>
