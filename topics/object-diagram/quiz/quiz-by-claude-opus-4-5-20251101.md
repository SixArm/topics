  <p>A snapshot of object instances and their relationships at a specific point in time</p>
  <p>An object diagram is a structural diagram that shows the actual instances of classes (objects) in a system and the relationships between them at a particular moment. Unlike class diagrams which show the general structure, object diagrams capture the system's state at a specific point in time, making them useful for illustrating examples of how objects interact in real scenarios.</p>
