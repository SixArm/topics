  <p>A psychological construct describing an individual's preference for distributing resources, ranging from prosocial (cooperative) to individualistic to competitive orientations</p>
  <p>Social value orientation (SVO) describes how individuals prefer to distribute resources in social situations—whether they prioritize cooperation and helping others (prosocial), focus on maximizing their own outcomes (individualistic), or seek to outperform others even at a cost (competitive). For technology professionals, understanding SVO is valuable when designing team structures, facilitating collaboration, building products that involve resource sharing or social interactions, and resolving conflicts. Teams with prosocial members tend to exhibit higher trust and cooperation, while awareness of different orientations can help leaders create environments that encourage constructive collaboration.</p>
