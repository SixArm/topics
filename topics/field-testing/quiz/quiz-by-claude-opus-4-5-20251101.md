# Field testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of field testing in software testing automation?

- [ ] To replace all internal testing with production-only testing
- [ ] To conduct automated tests in real-world environments where end users will actually interact with the software
- [ ] To eliminate the need for monitoring tools and test scripts
- [ ] To test software exclusively in controlled laboratory settings

  <p>To conduct automated tests in real-world environments where end users will actually interact with the software</p>
  <p>Field testing exposes applications to genuine user conditions, diverse hardware configurations, varying network conditions, and unpredictable usage patterns that cannot be fully replicated in internal testing environments. This bridges the gap between laboratory testing and real-world application performance, leading to more reliable software products.</p>
