  <p>Amortization expense from intangible assets</p>
  <p>EBITA adds the amortization expense to the EBIT calculation. Amortization represents the gradual reduction in value of intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and goodwill. By including this expense, EBITA provides a more accurate representation of a company's operating profitability by accounting for these intangible asset costs, while still excluding the effects of financing decisions (interest) and tax strategies.</p>
