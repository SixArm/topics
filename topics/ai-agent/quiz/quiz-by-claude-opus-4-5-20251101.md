  <p>It operates autonomously, perceives its environment, reasons about data, and works toward specific goals</p>
  <p>AI agents are defined by their combination of autonomy, sensing capabilities, reasoning mechanisms, learning abilities, and goal-directed behavior. Unlike traditional software that follows rigid instructions, AI agents can operate independently, gather information from their environment, make informed decisions, learn from experience, and take proactive actions to achieve their objectives—all without requiring direct human intervention.</p>
