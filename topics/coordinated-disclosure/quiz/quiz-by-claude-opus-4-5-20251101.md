# Coordinated disclosure

Question: What is the primary purpose of coordinated disclosure in cybersecurity?

  <p>To allow vulnerabilities to be fixed before malicious actors can exploit them</p>
  <p>Coordinated disclosure is a process where security vulnerabilities are reported privately to system owners, giving them time to develop and release fixes before the vulnerability is made public. This protects users, data, and systems from potential harm by ensuring patches are available before malicious actors can exploit the discovered weaknesses.</p>
