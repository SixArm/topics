# Area Under the Curve (AUC)

Question: What does an AUC value of 0.5 indicate about a binary classification model's performance?

- [ ] The model has achieved perfect classification accuracy
- [ ] The model performs no better than random guessing
- [ ] The model has a 50% true positive rate at all thresholds
- [ ] The model correctly classifies half of all positive cases

  <p>The model performs no better than random guessing</p>
  <p>In the context of ROC-AUC, a value of 0.5 indicates that the model has no discriminative ability between the positive and negative classes—it performs equivalent to random chance. An AUC of 1 represents perfect classification, while values below 0.5 suggest the model is performing worse than random (often indicating the labels may be inverted). This is a critical concept for technology professionals to understand when evaluating and comparing binary classification models.</p>
