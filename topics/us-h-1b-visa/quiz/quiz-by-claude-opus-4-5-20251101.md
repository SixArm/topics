  <p>It allows "dual intent," meaning holders can intend to immigrate permanently to the U.S.</p>
  <p>The H-1B visa uniquely permits "dual intent," which means visa holders can have the intention to eventually become permanent U.S. residents while on the visa. This is significant because many other non-immigrant visas require applicants to demonstrate they intend to return to their home country after their temporary stay. This feature makes the H-1B particularly valuable for technology professionals who may want to build a long-term career in the United States.</p>
