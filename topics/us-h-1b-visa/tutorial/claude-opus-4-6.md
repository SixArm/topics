# US H-1B visa

The United States H-1B visa is one of the most significant non-immigrant visa categories in the American immigration system. It allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require a body of highly specialized knowledge and at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent. Created to address shortages of skilled workers in fields such as technology, engineering, healthcare, and finance, the H-1B program has become a cornerstone of how American companies recruit global talent. Understanding its requirements, processes, and limitations is essential for any technology professional considering employment in the United States.

## Eligibility and Specialty Occupations

The H-1B visa is restricted to individuals who will fill a "specialty occupation" position. A specialty occupation is defined as one that requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge along with at least a bachelor's degree or higher in a specific discipline. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) evaluates each petition to determine whether the role genuinely qualifies.

Common specialty occupation fields include:

- **Science** -- research scientists, biologists, chemists, physicists
- **Technology** -- software engineers, data scientists, systems architects, cybersecurity analysts
- **Engineering** -- electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, civil engineers
- **Mathematics** -- statisticians, actuaries, quantitative analysts
- **Finance** -- financial analysts, economists, accountants
- **Healthcare** -- physicians, pharmacists, physical therapists
- **Other professional roles** -- attorneys, architects, university professors

The applicant must hold at least a U.S. bachelor's degree or its foreign equivalent in the relevant field. In some cases, a combination of progressive work experience and education may satisfy this requirement, with generally three years of specialized experience equating to one year of college education.

## Employer Sponsorship and the Petition Process

The H-1B is an employer-sponsored visa, meaning the foreign worker cannot self-petition. The sponsoring employer must initiate and fund the process. The key steps are:

1. **Labor Condition Application (LCA)**: The employer files an LCA with the U.S. Department of Labor, attesting that the foreign worker will be paid the prevailing wage for the occupation in the geographic area and that hiring the worker will not adversely affect the conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.

2. **Form I-129 Petition**: After LCA approval, the employer files Form I-129 (Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker) with USCIS, including supporting documentation such as the job description, the worker's educational credentials, and evidence that the position qualifies as a specialty occupation.

3. **USCIS Adjudication**: USCIS reviews the petition. If approved, the worker applies for the visa stamp at a U.S. consulate or embassy abroad (if outside the U.S.) or changes status domestically (if already in the U.S. on another valid visa).

4. **Premium Processing (Optional)**: Employers can pay an additional fee for premium processing, which guarantees a response from USCIS within 15 business days.

## Visa Cap and Lottery System

Congress has set an annual cap on H-1B visas. Due to demand consistently exceeding supply, USCIS conducts a lottery to select which petitions will be processed.

| Category | Annual Cap | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Regular cap | 65,000 | Available to all qualifying employers |
| Advanced degree exemption | 20,000 | For beneficiaries with a U.S. master's degree or higher |
| Cap-exempt employers | No limit | Universities, nonprofit research organizations, and government research organizations |

The timeline typically follows this pattern:

- **Early March**: USCIS opens the electronic registration period for the upcoming fiscal year.
- **Late March**: The registration window closes and USCIS conducts a random lottery among all registrations.
- **April 1**: Selected petitioners may file their full H-1B petitions.
- **October 1**: The approved H-1B status takes effect for the new fiscal year.

Technology professionals should be aware that the lottery success rate in recent years has hovered between 25% and 35% for any single registration, making the process uncertain and requiring contingency planning.

## Duration of Stay and Extensions

The initial period of stay granted on an H-1B visa is up to three years. This can be extended in increments for a maximum total period of six years. Beyond the six-year limit, extensions are possible under specific circumstances:

- **PERM labor certification or I-140 filed**: If the employer has initiated the green card process by filing a PERM labor certification or an I-140 immigrant petition at least 365 days before the six-year mark, the worker may receive one-year extensions beyond the sixth year.
- **Approved I-140**: If the worker has an approved I-140 but cannot adjust status due to visa number unavailability (common for applicants from India and China), three-year extensions are available.
- **Recapture of time spent abroad**: Time spent physically outside the U.S. during the H-1B validity period can be "recaptured" and does not count toward the six-year limit.

## Dependents and H-4 Visa

H-1B visa holders can bring their immediate family members to the United States under the H-4 dependent visa category. Eligible dependents include:

- **Spouses** of the H-1B holder
- **Unmarried children** under the age of 21

H-4 visa holders may attend school in the U.S. but historically could not work. However, a 2015 regulation allows certain H-4 spouses to apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) if the H-1B holder has an approved I-140 immigrant petition or has been granted an H-1B extension beyond the six-year limit. This work authorization has been subject to ongoing legal challenges and policy reviews, so technology professionals should verify the current status before relying on it.

## Dual Intent

One of the most important features distinguishing the H-1B from many other non-immigrant visas is the concept of "dual intent." H-1B holders are legally permitted to have the intent to immigrate permanently to the United States while simultaneously maintaining their temporary non-immigrant status. This means that:

- Applying for a green card does not jeopardize H-1B status.
- Consular officers cannot deny an H-1B visa solely because the applicant intends to stay permanently.
- H-1B holders can freely pursue employer-sponsored green card processes without the risk of being found to have violated their non-immigrant status.

This dual intent provision is particularly valuable for technology professionals who may begin their U.S. careers on an H-1B but plan to settle permanently.

## Portability and Changing Employers

H-1B visa holders have meaningful job mobility through the "portability" provision established by the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (AC21). Key aspects include:

- **Concurrent filing**: A new employer can file a new H-1B petition on behalf of the worker while the worker is still employed by the original sponsor.
- **Immediate start**: The worker can begin employment with the new employer as soon as the new petition is filed, without waiting for approval.
- **No new lottery required**: A worker already counted against the H-1B cap does not need to go through the lottery again when transferring employers.
- **Green card portability**: Under AC21, if a worker's I-140 has been approved and the I-485 adjustment of status application has been pending for 180 days or more, the worker can change employers and retain their green card priority date, provided the new job is in the same or a similar occupational classification.

## Costs and Fees

The financial burden of the H-1B process falls on the employer, not the employee. Employers are legally prohibited from passing the filing costs to the worker.

| Fee Type | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Base filing fee (I-129) | $780 | Required for all petitions |
| ACWIA training fee | $750 or $1,500 | $750 for employers with 25 or fewer employees; $1,500 for larger employers |
| Fraud prevention and detection fee | $500 | Required for initial petitions and change of employer |
| Public Law 114-113 fee | $4,000 | For employers with 50+ employees where over 50% are H-1B/L-1 workers |
| Asylum program fee | $600 | Required for most petitions |
| Premium processing (optional) | $2,805 | Guarantees 15-business-day response |

These fees are subject to change, and technology professionals should consult the current USCIS fee schedule for the most up-to-date figures.

## Common Challenges for Technology Professionals

Technology professionals navigating the H-1B process frequently encounter several challenges:

- **Lottery uncertainty**: With no guarantee of selection, candidates may need to apply across multiple years or explore alternative visa categories such as the O-1A (extraordinary ability) or L-1 (intracompany transfer).
- **Prevailing wage disputes**: USCIS and the Department of Labor increasingly scrutinize whether offered salaries meet prevailing wage levels, particularly for entry-level positions.
- **Requests for Evidence (RFEs)**: USCIS may issue RFEs questioning whether the role is a genuine specialty occupation, especially for broadly titled positions like "software developer" or "business analyst."
- **Country-specific backlogs**: Technology professionals from India face exceptionally long wait times for employment-based green cards, sometimes spanning decades, due to per-country limits on immigrant visas.
- **Policy changes**: H-1B regulations and enforcement priorities shift with changing administrations, making it critical to stay current on policy developments.

## Summary

The US H-1B visa remains the primary pathway for technology professionals seeking to work in the United States. It offers significant advantages including dual intent, employer portability, and eligibility for dependents, but it also presents substantial challenges including an annual lottery with uncertain odds, multi-step employer-sponsored filing processes, significant costs, and the potential for long green card backlogs depending on country of origin. Successful navigation of the H-1B process requires early planning, close coordination with immigration counsel, and awareness of evolving regulations and policy priorities. For technology professionals with specialized skills and a willing employer sponsor, the H-1B visa provides a structured and well-established route to building a career in the United States.
