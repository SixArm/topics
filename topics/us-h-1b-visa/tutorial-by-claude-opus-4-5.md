## US H-1B Visa: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

The H-1B visa is the primary pathway for technology professionals seeking to work in the United States. This tutorial covers everything you need to understand about the program, from eligibility requirements to strategic considerations for your career.

## What Is the H-1B Visa?

The H-1B is a non-immigrant work visa that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. Created to address skilled worker shortages, it has become the cornerstone visa category for the technology industry, enabling companies to hire software engineers, data scientists, product managers, and other tech professionals from around the world.

The visa is employer-sponsored, meaning you cannot apply independently—a U.S. company must petition on your behalf.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for an H-1B visa, you must meet specific educational and occupational criteria.

**Educational Requirements:**

| Qualification | Acceptability |
|---------------|---------------|
| U.S. Bachelor's degree or higher in a related field | Fully qualifies |
| Foreign equivalent to U.S. Bachelor's degree | Qualifies with credential evaluation |
| 12 years of progressive work experience | May substitute for Bachelor's degree (3 years experience = 1 year education) |
| Combination of education and experience | Evaluated case-by-case |

**Specialty Occupation Criteria:**

The position must require theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge. Common qualifying tech roles include:

- Software Engineers and Developers
- Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers
- Systems Architects
- DevOps and Cloud Engineers
- Product Managers (with technical requirements)
- UX Researchers (with advanced degree requirements)
- Cybersecurity Analysts

## The Application Process

The H-1B process involves multiple steps with specific timing requirements.

**Step 1: Employer Files Labor Condition Application (LCA)**

Your employer must file an LCA with the Department of Labor, attesting to paying prevailing wages and maintaining working conditions. This takes approximately 7-10 business days.

**Step 2: H-1B Registration and Lottery**

USCIS conducts an annual registration period (typically March 1-18). Employers submit electronic registrations for each prospective H-1B worker. If registrations exceed the annual cap, USCIS conducts a random lottery.

**Step 3: Petition Filing**

If selected in the lottery, your employer has 90 days to file the full I-129 petition with supporting documentation.

**Step 4: USCIS Adjudication**

USCIS reviews the petition. Processing times vary:

| Processing Type | Typical Timeline | Additional Cost |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Regular Processing | 3-6 months | None |
| Premium Processing | 15 business days | $2,805 |

**Step 5: Visa Stamping (if abroad)**

After petition approval, you must obtain the visa stamp at a U.S. consulate if you are outside the United States.

## Annual Cap and Lottery System

The H-1B program has numerical limits that create significant competition.

**Cap Structure:**

| Category | Annual Limit | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Regular Cap | 65,000 | Available to all qualifying employers |
| Master's Cap | 20,000 | Additional slots for U.S. advanced degree holders |
| Cap-Exempt | Unlimited | Universities, research institutions, nonprofit research organizations |

**Lottery Statistics:**

In recent years, the selection rate has been approximately 25-30% due to high demand. The lottery is random, and multiple registrations for the same beneficiary are prohibited.

**FY 2024 Lottery Changes:**

USCIS implemented a beneficiary-centric selection process, meaning each unique worker gets one chance in the lottery regardless of how many employers register them. This eliminated the previous advantage of having multiple employer sponsors.

## Duration and Extensions

**Initial Period:**

The H-1B visa is initially granted for up to three years.

**Extensions:**

| Scenario | Maximum Stay |
|----------|--------------|
| Standard H-1B | 6 years total |
| With approved I-140 (green card petition) | 1-year extensions beyond 6 years |
| With pending green card application (365+ days) | 3-year extensions beyond 6 years |

The ability to extend beyond six years is critical for technology professionals whose green card applications face long backlogs.

## Portability: Changing Employers

H-1B portability allows you to change jobs without starting the visa process from scratch.

**Requirements for Portability:**

- Current valid H-1B status
- New employer files a new H-1B petition
- You can begin working for the new employer once the petition is filed (not approved)

**Key Considerations:**

- You must have maintained valid status with your current employer
- The new petition should be filed before your current status expires
- If the new petition is denied, you must stop working for the new employer immediately

Portability provides significant flexibility but requires careful timing and documentation.

## Dependents: H-4 Visa

H-1B holders can bring immediate family members to the United States.

**Eligible Dependents:**

- Spouse (H-4 visa)
- Unmarried children under 21 (H-4 visa)

**H-4 Work Authorization:**

Certain H-4 spouses can obtain Employment Authorization Documents (EADs):

| Eligibility Criteria | Work Authorization |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| H-1B holder has approved I-140 | Eligible for H-4 EAD |
| H-1B holder in 7th+ year extension | Eligible for H-4 EAD |
| Standard H-4 without above criteria | Not work authorized |

The H-4 EAD allows unrestricted employment without employer sponsorship.

## Dual Intent: Path to Permanent Residency

Unlike most non-immigrant visas, the H-1B allows "dual intent"—you can openly pursue permanent residency (green card) while on H-1B status.

**Practical Implications:**

- You can have a pending green card application without jeopardizing H-1B status
- Consular officers cannot deny your visa solely because you intend to immigrate
- You can travel internationally while green card applications are pending

**Common Green Card Pathways for Tech Professionals:**

| Category | Requirements | Typical Timeline |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability) | Sustained national/international acclaim | 1-2 years |
| EB-1B (Outstanding Researcher) | 3+ years research experience, international recognition | 1-2 years |
| EB-2 (Advanced Degree) | Master's or Bachelor's + 5 years experience | 2-10+ years (country-dependent) |
| EB-3 (Skilled Worker) | Bachelor's degree | 2-10+ years (country-dependent) |

For professionals from India and China, employment-based green card backlogs can extend well beyond a decade, making H-1B extensions critical.

## Employer Obligations and Costs

Understanding employer responsibilities helps you evaluate opportunities.

**Prevailing Wage Requirements:**

Employers must pay at least the prevailing wage for your occupation in the geographic area. The Department of Labor defines four wage levels:

| Wage Level | Description | Typical Experience |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Level 1 | Entry-level | 0-2 years |
| Level 2 | Qualified | 2-5 years |
| Level 3 | Experienced | 5-8 years |
| Level 4 | Fully competent | 8+ years |

**Employer Costs:**

| Fee Type | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Base Filing Fee | $780 | All petitions |
| ACWIA Fee | $750-$1,500 | Based on company size |
| Fraud Prevention Fee | $500 | All petitions |
| Asylum Program Fee | $600 | Most petitions |
| Premium Processing | $2,805 | Optional |
| Legal Fees | $2,000-$5,000 | Varies by firm |

Employers cannot legally pass these costs to the employee.

## Strategic Considerations for Tech Professionals

**Timing Your Job Search:**

- Registration typically opens in early March for October 1 start dates
- Begin employer discussions by January to allow time for internal approvals
- Consider cap-exempt employers (universities, research institutions) if lottery odds concern you

**Negotiating with Employers:**

- Confirm the company has H-1B sponsorship experience
- Ask about premium processing availability
- Discuss green card sponsorship timeline and policies
- Understand what happens if your lottery application is not selected

**Maintaining Status:**

- Keep all immigration documents organized and accessible
- Track visa and I-94 expiration dates carefully
- Notify your employer and attorney immediately if your employment situation changes
- Maintain valid status continuously—gaps can have serious consequences

**Backup Planning:**

- Consider O-1 visa if you have extraordinary ability credentials
- Explore L-1 visa if your employer has international offices
- Evaluate whether a Master's degree would improve your lottery odds (Master's cap)

## Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Not selected in lottery | Reapply next year; consider cap-exempt employers; explore O-1 or L-1 alternatives |
| Request for Evidence (RFE) | Work with experienced immigration attorney; provide comprehensive documentation |
| Visa stamping delays | Apply well in advance of travel; consider premium processing for petition |
| Employer instability | Understand portability rights; maintain professional network |
| Long green card wait | Maximize H-1B extensions; explore EB-1 categories if qualified |

## Key Takeaways

The H-1B visa remains the primary work visa for technology professionals, despite its limitations. Success requires understanding the lottery system, maintaining meticulous documentation, and planning strategically for both short-term employment and long-term immigration goals.

Start conversations with potential employers early, work with experienced immigration counsel, and always have contingency plans given the inherent uncertainty in the lottery system. For those selected, the H-1B provides a stable platform to build a U.S. career while pursuing permanent residency.
