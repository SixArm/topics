  <p>To create a product that solves a real problem for customers and is easy and intuitive to use</p>
  <p>Product discovery is fundamentally about identifying and solving real customer problems in a user-friendly way. While roadmaps and prototypes are part of the discovery process, they are means to an end—the ultimate goal is creating a product that addresses genuine customer needs with good usability. This customer-centric focus distinguishes product discovery from other activities like competitive analysis or investor relations.</p>
