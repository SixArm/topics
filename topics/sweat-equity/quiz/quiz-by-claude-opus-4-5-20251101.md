  <p>The value of an individual's time and effort invested in a venture in lieu of monetary investment</p>
  <p>Sweat equity refers to the non-financial contribution of time, effort, and expertise that individuals provide to a project or company instead of cash investment. It is commonly used in startups to compensate early team members who cannot afford to invest money but contribute valuable work. This equity can be granted as company shares, profit sharing, or revenue percentages, and helps startups attract talent when they cannot offer competitive salaries.</p>
