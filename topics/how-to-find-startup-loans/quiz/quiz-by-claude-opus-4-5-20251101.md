  <p>The SBA guarantees a portion of loans provided through partner lenders, making it easier for small businesses to qualify</p>
  <p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers several loan programs for small businesses, including startup loans. Rather than lending directly, the SBA works through partner lenders and guarantees a portion of the loan. This guarantee reduces the risk for lenders, which makes it easier for small businesses and startups to qualify for financing they might not otherwise be able to obtain.</p>
