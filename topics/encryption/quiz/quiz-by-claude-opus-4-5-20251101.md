# Encryption

Question: What is the fundamental difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

- [ ] Symmetric encryption is faster but requires the ciphertext to be stored separately from the key
- [ ] Asymmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while symmetric uses different keys
- [ ] Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric uses different keys (public and private)
- [ ] Symmetric encryption can only be used for data at rest, while asymmetric is only for data in transit

  <p>Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric uses different keys (public and private)</p>
  <p>In symmetric encryption, a single shared secret key is used by both parties to encrypt and decrypt data. In asymmetric encryption (also called public-key cryptography), a pair of mathematically related keys is used: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This distinction is critical for technology professionals because it determines key distribution strategies, performance characteristics, and appropriate use cases—symmetric for bulk data encryption due to speed, and asymmetric for secure key exchange and digital signatures.</p>
