  <p>Change requests are treated as opportunities for improvement rather than disruptions</p>
  <p>Agile change management embraces adaptability and views change as a natural part of the development process. Rather than treating change requests as problems to avoid, teams continuously evaluate and prioritize modifications based on business value and user needs. This approach integrates with agile principles of responding to change over following predetermined plans, enabling teams to deliver value more effectively while meeting evolving requirements and stakeholder expectations.</p>
