  <p>It examines total economic impact throughout the entire lifecycle of product ownership and utilization</p>
  <p>A value-in-use study goes beyond simple purchase price comparisons by measuring the comprehensive economic value customers derive from using a product in their actual operating environment. This includes both direct financial impacts (cost savings, labor reductions) and indirect benefits (improved satisfaction, reduced downtime) across the product's full lifecycle, enabling vendors to justify value-based pricing and articulate concrete value propositions.</p>
