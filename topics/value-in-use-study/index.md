# Value-in-use study

A value-in-use study is a comprehensive research methodology designed to measure and analyze the economic value that customers derive from using a specific product or service in their actual operating environment. Unlike traditional cost-benefit analyses that focus on purchase price comparisons, value-in-use studies examine the total economic impact throughout the entire lifecycle of product ownership and utilization.

The methodology typically involves collecting quantitative data on cost savings, productivity improvements, quality enhancements, and other measurable benefits that customers experience when using the product. Researchers gather information through detailed customer interviews, operational data analysis, and financial documentation review. This approach captures both direct financial impacts, such as reduced material costs or labor savings, and indirect benefits like improved customer satisfaction or reduced downtime.

Value-in-use studies are particularly valuable for B2B companies selling complex products or services where the purchase decision involves multiple stakeholders and significant financial investment. These studies help sales teams articulate concrete value propositions beyond basic product features, enabling them to justify premium pricing and differentiate from competitors. The research also provides marketing teams with credible, customer-validated evidence to support promotional claims and case studies.

The findings from value-in-use studies often reveal that customers achieve returns on investment that far exceed the initial purchase price, sometimes by multiples. This information empowers vendors to price products based on delivered value rather than cost-plus models. Additionally, these studies can identify opportunities for product improvements or new service offerings by highlighting areas where customers struggle to realize full value. The resulting insights strengthen customer relationships and inform strategic business decisions across product development, pricing, and market positioning initiatives.
