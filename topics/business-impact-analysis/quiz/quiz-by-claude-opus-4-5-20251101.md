  <p>To identify and prioritize the impacts of disruptions on critical business functions to inform business continuity planning</p>
  <p>A Business Impact Analysis is a systematic process that assesses the potential consequences of disruptions on an organization's critical functions, processes, systems, and assets. Its goal is to quantify potential effects and establish recovery objectives (RTO and RPO), which then guide the development of comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
