  <p>It is designed to address a particular problem domain or application context</p>
  <p>Unlike general-purpose programming languages such as Java or C++, DSLs are specifically designed to be concise, expressive, and closely aligned with the terminology and concepts used in a target domain. This focused design enables increased productivity, improved communication with domain experts, better maintainability, and greater reuse within that domain.</p>
