  <p>Accelerators are more structured, intensive, and time-limited programs with focused mentoring</p>
  <p>Accelerators differ from incubators in that they are typically more structured, intensive, and time-limited programs (usually three to six months). They provide intensive training and mentoring along with funding, networking, and resources. Incubators, by contrast, are more long-term and flexible, primarily offering office space and support services without the intensive cohort-based training that accelerators provide.</p>
