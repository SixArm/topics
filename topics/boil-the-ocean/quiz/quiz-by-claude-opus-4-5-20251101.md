  <p>An approach that tackles all problems simultaneously without clear priorities, making success virtually impossible</p>
  <p>"Boil the ocean" is a cautionary idiom describing a task or project that is so overly ambitious, broad in scope, or lacking in focus that it becomes virtually impossible to complete. The phrase warns against taking on projects without breaking them into manageable pieces, and emphasizes the importance of setting achievable goals and taking incremental steps rather than attempting to solve everything at once.</p>
