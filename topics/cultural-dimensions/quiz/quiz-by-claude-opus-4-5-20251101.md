  <p>Power Distance</p>
  <p>Power Distance measures the extent to which a society accepts unequal distribution of power and authority. For technology professionals, this dimension is essential when designing software workflows, approval processes, and collaboration tools for global teams. In high power distance cultures, team members may expect hierarchical approval chains and defer to senior leadership, while low power distance cultures favor flat structures and direct communication. Understanding this helps avoid friction in tools like project management systems, code review processes, and communication platforms that cross cultural boundaries.</p>
