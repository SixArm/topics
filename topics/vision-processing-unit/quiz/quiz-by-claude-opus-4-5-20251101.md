  <p>To accelerate and handle computer vision tasks such as object detection and image classification</p>
  <p>A VPU is a specialized hardware component designed specifically to accelerate computer vision workloads. It offloads vision-related processing from the CPU and GPU, using architectures optimized for tasks like facial recognition, object detection, tracking, and image classification. VPUs are commonly used in smartphones, security cameras, autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotics.</p>
