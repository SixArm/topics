  <p>When sketching a user interface, the recommended approach is to begin with rough sketches that use simple shapes and lines. This allows you to quickly explore and visualize design ideas, focusing on capturing the basic arrangement and flow of information rather than getting caught up in details. This iterative approach enables rapid experimentation with different layouts before investing time in more refined digital wireframes or prototypes.</p>
