  <p>Andreessen Horowitz is known for its "founder-friendly" approach to investing, which means they prioritize building relationships with founders and helping them build their businesses rather than just providing capital. The firm maintains a large team of operational experts who provide guidance and support to portfolio companies in areas such as marketing, engineering, and recruiting—differentiating them from firms that take a more hands-off approach.</p>
