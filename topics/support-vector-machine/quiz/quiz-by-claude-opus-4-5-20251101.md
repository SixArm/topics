# Support Vector Machine

Question: What is the primary goal of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) when classifying data?

- [ ] To minimize the number of features used in the model
- [ ] To find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes
- [ ] To cluster data points into groups without labels
- [ ] To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset

  <p>To find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes</p>
  <p>SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes. The algorithm specifically maximizes the margin—the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (support vectors) from each class. This maximum-margin approach helps SVM achieve good generalization to new, unseen data and makes it robust against overfitting.</p>
