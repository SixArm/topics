- [ ] The project becomes later due to increased communication overhead and coordination
- [ ] The project quality improves but the schedule remains unchanged
- [ ] The project cost decreases through economies of scale

  <p>The project becomes later due to increased communication overhead and coordination</p>
  <p>Brooks' Law states that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." This occurs because new team members require time to become productive (ramp-up time), and more people means exponentially more communication channels. The coordination overhead grows faster than the productive capacity added, making the project even more delayed rather than accelerating it.</p>
