  <p>Inferential Statistics</p>
  <p>Inferential statistics is specifically designed to generalize findings from a sample to a larger population. It includes methods such as confidence intervals, t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis, and chi-square tests. Unlike descriptive statistics, which only summarizes the data at hand, inferential statistics enables you to draw conclusions and make predictions about a population beyond the observed data.</p>
