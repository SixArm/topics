# Sequoia Capital

Sequoia Capital is one of the most influential and enduring venture capital firms in the technology industry. Founded in 1972 by Don Valentine in Silicon Valley, the firm has played a pivotal role in shaping the modern technology landscape by backing companies that have grown into some of the most valuable enterprises on the planet. With a portfolio that spans decades and includes names like Apple, Google, Oracle, Airbnb, Zoom, and Stripe, Sequoia Capital has established itself as a defining force in startup financing and entrepreneurial development.

## History and Founding

Don Valentine, a former sales executive at Fairchild Semiconductor and National Semiconductor, founded Sequoia Capital with the conviction that great markets produce great companies. Valentine's philosophy centered on identifying large addressable markets and backing exceptional founders who could capture them. This market-first orientation became a foundational principle of the firm and distinguished it from competitors who prioritized technology or team credentials above all else. Under Valentine's leadership, Sequoia made early investments in Atari, Apple, Cisco Systems, and Oracle, establishing a track record that few venture firms have matched.

## Investment Strategy

Sequoia Capital invests across the full lifecycle of a company, from inception through public offering and beyond. The firm organizes its capital deployment across distinct stages, each with its own risk profile and engagement model.

| Stage | Typical Investment Size | Focus |
|-------|------------------------|-------|
| Seed | $100K – $2M | Pre-product or early product-market fit validation |
| Series A/B | $5M – $50M | Scaling product, building go-to-market operations |
| Growth | $50M – $500M+ | Market expansion, international scaling, pre-IPO positioning |
| Public / Crossover | Varies | Long-term holdings in portfolio companies post-IPO |

Sequoia restructured its fund model in 2021, creating a single open-ended fund structure called the Sequoia Fund. This allowed the firm to hold positions in public companies indefinitely rather than distributing shares to limited partners after an IPO, reflecting a belief that the best returns compound over longer time horizons.

## Sector Focus

While Sequoia is most closely associated with technology, the firm maintains investments across a broad set of sectors:

- **Enterprise Software and Infrastructure**: Cloud computing, developer tools, cybersecurity, and data platforms.
- **Consumer Internet and Mobile**: Social platforms, marketplaces, e-commerce, and consumer applications.
- **Financial Technology**: Payments, lending, insurance, and blockchain-based financial services.
- **Healthcare and Life Sciences**: Digital health platforms, biotech, and medical device companies.
- **Energy and Climate**: Clean energy, sustainability technology, and carbon reduction solutions.

This diversification enables Sequoia to identify cross-sector patterns and apply lessons from one domain to portfolio companies in another.

## Notable Portfolio Companies

Sequoia's portfolio reads as a history of modern technology. The following table highlights a selection of landmark investments and their outcomes.

## Value-Added Services

Sequoia differentiates itself from other venture firms by offering substantial operational support beyond capital. The firm's value-added services include:

- **Talent and Recruiting**: Sequoia maintains a dedicated talent team that helps portfolio companies identify and hire senior executives, engineers, and board members.
- **Sequoia Academy**: An educational program that provides founders and executives with structured training on topics such as company building, leadership, and scaling operations.
- **Network Access**: Portfolio companies gain access to a curated network of industry experts, former founders, and corporate partners who can serve as advisors and customers.
- **Go-to-Market Support**: The firm assists with sales strategy, pricing models, channel development, and international expansion planning.
- **Business Strategy and Governance**: Sequoia partners frequently serve on portfolio company boards and contribute to strategic decisions around fundraising, organizational design, and market positioning.

## Global Presence

Sequoia Capital operates across three major geographies, each functioning with regional leadership and investment autonomy.

| Region | Headquarters | Key Markets |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| United States / Europe | Menlo Park, California | North America, Western Europe |
| India / Southeast Asia | Bengaluru, India | India, Singapore, Indonesia, broader Southeast Asia |
| China (formerly) | Beijing / Shanghai | Greater China (separated into an independent firm, HongShan, in 2023) |

In 2023, Sequoia completed a significant restructuring that separated its China and India/Southeast Asia operations into fully independent entities. The China-focused arm rebranded as HongShan, while the India/Southeast Asia operation became Peak XV Partners. Sequoia Capital now focuses primarily on the United States and Europe. This separation reflected growing geopolitical tensions and regulatory complexity in cross-border investing.

## Investment Philosophy

Sequoia's investment philosophy can be distilled into several core tenets that have remained consistent across decades:

- **Market size matters**: The firm prioritizes companies operating in large or rapidly expanding addressable markets, believing that even mediocre execution in a great market can produce strong returns.
- **Founders first**: Sequoia seeks founders who demonstrate clarity of vision, resilience, and the ability to attract exceptional talent.
- **Long-term compounding**: The firm's restructured fund model reflects a commitment to holding investments for extended periods, capturing value that accrues over years rather than quarters.
- **Pattern recognition**: With fifty years of institutional knowledge, Sequoia applies pattern recognition across industries, business models, and founder archetypes to inform investment decisions.
- **Courage of conviction**: The firm is willing to lead rounds, write large checks, and back contrarian ideas when the evidence supports the thesis.
