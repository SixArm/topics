  <p>It eliminates fixed sprint boundaries, allowing work to flow continuously while using on-demand planning</p>
  <p>Scrumban maintains Scrum's emphasis on planning meetings and retrospectives but eliminates fixed sprint boundaries, allowing work to flow more naturally. Planning occurs on-demand when the backlog reaches a predetermined trigger point, rather than at fixed intervals. This provides more flexibility than traditional Scrum sprints while maintaining predictability for stakeholders.</p>
