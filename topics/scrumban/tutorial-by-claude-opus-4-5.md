# Scrumban: Tutorial

## Overview

Scrumban is a hybrid agile methodology that blends elements of Scrum and Kanban into a flexible framework suited for teams that need the best of both worlds. It emerged as organizations recognized that strict Scrum sprint boundaries could sometimes be too rigid, while pure Kanban might lack the structural guardrails teams need for planning and reflection. Scrumban maintains Scrum's emphasis on regular planning meetings and retrospectives while incorporating Kanban's continuous flow model, visual management, and work-in-progress (WIP) limits.

For agile change technology professionals, Scrumban is a valuable tool for guiding teams through transitions -- whether moving from Scrum toward Kanban, adapting to unpredictable workloads, or seeking a methodology that accommodates both planned feature development and urgent production support.

## Key Concepts

### Continuous Flow with Planning Triggers

Unlike Scrum, which plans work at fixed sprint intervals, Scrumban uses on-demand planning. When the team's backlog reaches a predetermined trigger point (for example, when the number of items in the "To Do" column drops below a threshold), a planning session is convened to prioritize and pull new work items. This approach provides flexibility without abandoning planning discipline.

### Visual Workflow Management

Scrumban uses Kanban boards to make work visible. Columns on the board represent workflow stages such as "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," and "Done." Every team member can see the current state of all work at a glance, which promotes transparency, accountability, and collaboration.

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits

WIP limits are applied to each workflow stage to prevent bottlenecks and maintain a steady delivery pace. By restricting how many items can be in any given stage simultaneously, teams avoid overcommitting and ensure that work flows smoothly through the system.

### Elimination of Fixed Sprint Boundaries

Scrumban removes the strict time-boxing of sprints. Work items flow continuously through the system, and delivery happens as items are completed rather than at the end of a fixed sprint cycle. This is particularly beneficial for teams handling a mix of planned development work and unpredictable requests such as bug fixes or production incidents.

### Retained Ceremonies

While Scrumban eliminates fixed sprint boundaries, it retains key Scrum ceremonies that provide structure and enable improvement. Regular retrospectives help teams reflect on their process, and planning sessions (triggered by backlog thresholds) ensure that work is properly prioritized and understood.

### Pull-Based Work Assignment

Like Kanban, Scrumban uses a pull system where team members pull work from the backlog when they have capacity, rather than having work pushed to them by a manager or process. This respects individual capacity and supports sustainable pace.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

### Step 1: Assess Your Current State

Evaluate your team's current methodology, pain points, and goals. Scrumban is particularly well suited for teams that find Scrum's fixed sprints too rigid, teams transitioning from Scrum to Kanban, maintenance and support teams with unpredictable workloads, and mature teams that have outgrown prescriptive frameworks.

### Step 2: Set Up a Kanban Board

Create a visual board (physical or digital) with columns representing your workflow stages. Start with simple stages: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done. You can refine and add columns as you learn more about your team's actual workflow.

### Step 3: Establish WIP Limits

Set work-in-progress limits for each column. Start conservatively -- for example, limit "In Progress" to the number of team members minus one. WIP limits force the team to finish work before starting new items, which reduces context switching and improves throughput.

### Step 4: Define Planning Triggers

Establish the trigger point for planning sessions. For example, when the "To Do" column drops to three or fewer items, schedule a planning meeting to replenish the queue. This replaces Scrum's fixed sprint planning cadence with a demand-driven approach.

### Step 5: Maintain Key Ceremonies

Keep regular retrospectives (every two weeks or monthly) to review the process and identify improvements. Conduct planning sessions when triggered by backlog thresholds. Optionally, retain daily standups to maintain team communication and identify blockers.

### Step 6: Track Metrics

Measure cycle time (how long each item takes from start to finish), lead time (from request to delivery), throughput (items completed per time period), and WIP levels. Use these metrics to identify trends, detect bottlenecks, and guide process improvements.

### Step 7: Handle Urgent Work

One of Scrumban's strengths is its ability to accommodate urgent work without disrupting the entire system. Create an expedite lane on your board for critical items that must bypass normal flow. Set a strict limit on expedite items (ideally one at a time) to prevent the expedite lane from becoming the default.

### Step 8: Iterate and Evolve

Regularly review your Scrumban implementation. Adjust WIP limits based on observed throughput, refine workflow stages to better reflect your process, and tune planning triggers based on team velocity. Scrumban is designed to evolve with your team's needs.

## Key Takeaway

Scrumban provides agile change professionals with a pragmatic hybrid methodology that combines Scrum's structured ceremonies and planning discipline with Kanban's continuous flow and visual management. It is especially powerful for teams in transition, teams with mixed workloads, and mature teams seeking greater flexibility. The key to successful Scrumban adoption is maintaining discipline around WIP limits and planning triggers while embracing the freedom of continuous flow. Teams must resist the temptation to abandon all structure, as this can lead to chaotic ad-hoc development. When implemented thoughtfully, Scrumban delivers reduced ceremony overhead, better handling of changing priorities, improved cycle time visibility, and a sustainable pace that keeps teams productive and engaged.
