# Scrumban

Scrumban is a hybrid agile methodology that combines elements of Scrum and Kanban to create a flexible framework for software development teams. This approach emerged as organizations sought to leverage the structured sprint planning of Scrum while incorporating the continuous flow and visual management principles of Kanban.

The methodology maintains Scrum's emphasis on regular planning meetings and retrospectives but eliminates fixed sprint boundaries, allowing work to flow more naturally. Teams use Kanban boards to visualize their workflow, with columns representing different stages of development such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Work-in-progress (WIP) limits are applied to prevent bottlenecks and maintain steady delivery pace.

Planning in Scrumban occurs on-demand rather than at fixed intervals. When the backlog reaches a predetermined trigger point, the team conducts a planning session to prioritize and pull new work items. This approach provides more flexibility than traditional Scrum sprints while maintaining the predictability that stakeholders require.

Scrumban particularly benefits teams transitioning from Scrum to Kanban. It accommodates both planned features and urgent bug fixes without disrupting the entire sprint. The methodology also works well for mature teams that have outgrown rigid sprint structures but still need some organizational framework.

The key advantages include reduced overhead from sprint ceremonies, better handling of changing priorities, and improved cycle time visibility. However, teams must be disciplined about maintaining flow and avoiding the trap of reverting to chaotic ad-hoc development.
