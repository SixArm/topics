# Assignment agreement (AA)

An assignment agreement (AA) is a legal contract in which one party, known as the assignor, transfers or assigns certain rights, property, or obligations to another party, known as the assignee. In the technology industry, assignment agreements are foundational instruments used to transfer intellectual property, software licenses, employment-related inventions, domain names, and contractual obligations. Understanding how assignment agreements work is essential for technology professionals involved in software development, startup formation, mergers and acquisitions, or any situation where ownership of intangible assets must change hands.

## How an assignment agreement works

An assignment agreement specifies the terms and conditions of the transfer, including the rights and responsibilities of each party, the consideration (payment or other value) to be exchanged, and any restrictions or limitations on the assignment. The agreement typically includes a description of the property or rights being assigned, the parties involved in the transaction, and any relevant terms or conditions of the transfer. The agreement may also include representations and warranties by the assignor, as well as indemnification provisions to protect the assignee against any claims or liabilities related to the assigned property.

Not all rights or obligations can be assigned. Some may be personal in nature and cannot be transferred to another party. Additionally, some assignments may require the consent of other parties, such as a licensor, landlord, or creditor, before they can be completed. In technology contexts, software license agreements frequently include anti-assignment clauses that prohibit transfer without the licensor's written approval.

## Common types of assignment agreements in technology

Assignment agreements appear across many domains. The following table summarizes the most common types encountered by technology professionals:

| Type | What is assigned | Typical scenario |
|---|---|---|
| Intellectual property assignment | Patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks | Employee or contractor assigns invention rights to the company |
| Software license assignment | Rights to use, distribute, or modify software | Company acquisition transfers license rights to the acquiring entity |
| Domain name assignment | Ownership of an internet domain | Startup sells or transfers a domain to a new owner |
| Contract assignment | Rights and obligations under an existing contract | Outsourcing vendor transfers a service agreement to a successor vendor |
| Lease assignment | Rights under a commercial lease | Company relocates and assigns its office lease to another tenant |
| Data or customer list assignment | Ownership of data assets or customer relationships | Business unit divestiture transfers customer records to the buyer |

## Key elements of an assignment agreement

A well-drafted assignment agreement addresses several critical elements:

- **Identification of parties.** Full legal names and roles of the assignor and assignee.
- **Description of assigned rights.** A precise and comprehensive description of the property, rights, or obligations being transferred.
- **Consideration.** The payment, equity, or other value exchanged for the assignment. Some employment-related assignments are made for nominal consideration or as a condition of employment.
- **Representations and warranties.** Statements by the assignor confirming ownership, authority to assign, and the absence of encumbrances or conflicting obligations.
- **Indemnification.** Provisions that protect the assignee against claims, losses, or liabilities arising from the assigned property.
- **Consent requirements.** Acknowledgment of any third-party consents that must be obtained before the assignment takes effect.
- **Effective date and conditions.** The date the assignment becomes effective, along with any conditions precedent such as regulatory approval or payment.
- **Governing law and dispute resolution.** The jurisdiction whose laws govern the agreement and the mechanism for resolving disputes.

## Assignment agreements in employment and contracting

For technology professionals, the most frequently encountered assignment agreement is the intellectual property assignment embedded in employment or independent contractor agreements. Employers routinely require employees and contractors to assign all inventions, works of authorship, and related intellectual property created during the course of employment or engagement.

Key considerations include:

- **Scope of assignment.** Some agreements assign only work created using company resources or related to the company's business, while others are broader and may cover all inventions made during the employment period.
- **Prior inventions.** Many agreements include an exhibit where the assignor lists pre-existing inventions that are excluded from the assignment.
- **State-specific protections.** Several U.S. states, including California, Delaware, Illinois, and Washington, have statutes limiting the enforceability of overly broad invention assignment clauses, particularly those that claim rights to inventions created entirely on the employee's own time with no company resources.
- **Work-for-hire doctrine.** Under U.S. copyright law, works created by employees within the scope of employment are automatically owned by the employer as "works made for hire." For independent contractors, however, an explicit assignment agreement is typically required to transfer copyright ownership.

## Assignment versus licensing

Technology professionals often encounter both assignment agreements and license agreements. Understanding the distinction is important:

| Characteristic | Assignment | License |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership transfer | Full ownership transfers to the assignee | Ownership remains with the licensor |
| Duration | Permanent (unless otherwise specified) | Typically time-limited or revocable |
| Control | Assignee gains full control over the asset | Licensor retains control and sets usage terms |
| Reversibility | Generally irreversible without a new agreement | Can expire, be terminated, or renewed |
| Typical use case | Startup assigns all IP to the company entity | SaaS vendor licenses software to customers |

The choice between assignment and licensing depends on the strategic objectives of the parties. Assignments are preferred when permanent, unconditional transfer of ownership is desired. Licenses are preferred when the owner wants to retain control while granting usage rights.

## Risks and pitfalls

Technology professionals should be aware of several common risks associated with assignment agreements:

- **Ambiguous scope.** Vaguely worded descriptions of assigned rights can lead to disputes about what was actually transferred.
- **Missing assignments.** Failure to obtain proper assignments from all contributors, especially early-stage contractors, can create ownership gaps that surface during due diligence for funding rounds or acquisitions.
- **Anti-assignment clauses.** Many contracts contain provisions that prohibit or restrict assignment without consent. Attempting to assign such contracts without authorization can result in breach.
- **Chain-of-title issues.** In mergers and acquisitions, incomplete or missing assignment documentation can cloud the chain of title for key intellectual property, creating legal risk and reducing deal value.
- **Cross-border complications.** Different jurisdictions have varying rules about what can be assigned, what formalities are required, and whether moral rights (common in European copyright law) can be waived or transferred.

## Related

Technology professionals working with assignment agreements should also explore related topics including intellectual property law, non-disclosure agreements, non-compete agreements, licensing agreements, work-for-hire doctrine, employee agreements, consulting agreements, joint venture agreements, mergers and acquisitions, due diligence, and confidentiality agreements. Understanding these adjacent areas provides the broader legal and business context needed to negotiate and manage assignment agreements effectively.

## Summary

An assignment agreement is a legal contract that transfers rights, property, or obligations from an assignor to an assignee. In technology, these agreements are most commonly used to assign intellectual property, software licenses, domain names, and contractual obligations. A well-drafted assignment agreement clearly identifies the parties, precisely describes the assigned rights, specifies consideration, and includes appropriate representations, warranties, and indemnification provisions. Technology professionals must pay particular attention to the scope of invention assignments in employment agreements, the distinction between assignment and licensing, and the risks posed by ambiguous language, missing assignments, and anti-assignment clauses. Properly executed assignment agreements protect both parties and provide the legal certainty necessary for business transactions, investment, and growth.
