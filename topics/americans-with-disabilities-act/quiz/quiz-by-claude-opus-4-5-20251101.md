  <p>They must provide reasonable accommodations unless it causes undue hardship</p>
  <p>The ADA requires employers with 15 or more employees to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities, as long as those accommodations do not create an undue hardship for the employer. Reasonable accommodations may include changes to job duties, work schedules, physical work environments, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services such as assistive technology. For technology professionals, this is critical knowledge when designing accessible software, workplace tools, and digital experiences.</p>
