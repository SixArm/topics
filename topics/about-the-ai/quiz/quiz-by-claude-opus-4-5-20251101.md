  <p>To provide direction, editing, and oversight</p>
  <p>While ChatGPT can generate text based on patterns from its training data, it does not have its own thoughts or ideas. A human author must provide guidance and direction, edit the generated content for clarity and correctness, and oversee the process to ensure the final product meets quality standards.</p>
