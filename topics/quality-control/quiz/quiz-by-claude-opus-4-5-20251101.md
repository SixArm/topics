  <p>Quality control focuses on identifying and correcting defects, while quality assurance focuses on preventing defects through processes and standards</p>
  <p>Quality control is reactive—it examines deliverables through inspections and testing to find and fix defects. Quality assurance is proactive—it establishes processes, procedures, and standards to ensure the project is executed correctly from the start, thereby preventing defects from occurring in the first place.</p>
