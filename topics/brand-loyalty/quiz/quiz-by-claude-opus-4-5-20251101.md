  <p>It ensures long-term sales and revenue streams while reducing the impact of competition</p>
  <p>Brand loyalty provides sustained revenue because loyal customers consistently purchase from the same brand over time. Additionally, these customers are less likely to switch to competitors even when similar products are available, which insulates the business from competitive pressure. Loyal customers also provide word-of-mouth recommendations that help attract new customers organically.</p>
