  <p>Springs are elastic elements that expand or contract, while struts are fixed elements that define minimum size or spacing</p>
  <p>Springs act as flexible connectors that push or pull components to maintain optimal spacing and alignment based on available space. Struts, in contrast, are rigid elements that serve as anchors or fixed reference points, defining minimum size or spacing constraints. Together, they enable responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.</p>
