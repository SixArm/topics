  <p>Income approach</p>
  <p>The income approach looks at the startup's future earnings and cash flow using discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis or capitalization of earnings models. It is often considered the most reliable method of startup valuation, though it can be difficult to estimate future earnings accurately. In contrast, the market approach relies on comparable companies, while the scorecard and Berkus methods are hybrid approaches commonly used for early-stage startups with limited revenue data.</p>
