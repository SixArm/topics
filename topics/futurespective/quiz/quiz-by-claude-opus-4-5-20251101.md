  <p>To imagine a range of possible future scenarios and use them to inform current decision-making and planning</p>
  <p>A futurespective is a forward-thinking group activity that helps teams explore and envision possible futures. Unlike a retrospective which looks backward, a futurespective focuses on imagining different scenarios—such as best-case and worst-case outcomes—to better understand potential consequences of current actions and make more informed choices, especially useful for projects with high uncertainty.</p>
