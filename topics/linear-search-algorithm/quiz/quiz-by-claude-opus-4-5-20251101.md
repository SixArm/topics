# Linear search algorithm

Question: What is the time complexity of a linear search algorithm?

- [ ] O(log n) - time increases logarithmically with list size
- [ ] O(1) - time remains constant regardless of list size
- [ ] O(n) - time increases linearly with list size
- [ ] O(n²) - time increases quadratically with list size

  <p>O(n) - time increases linearly with list size</p>
  <p>Linear search iterates through elements one by one until the target is found or the entire list is searched. In the worst case, it must check every element, so the time required grows proportionally with the number of elements (n) in the list. This makes it inefficient for large datasets compared to algorithms like binary search (O(log n)), which is why understanding its time complexity is essential for choosing the right search approach.</p>
