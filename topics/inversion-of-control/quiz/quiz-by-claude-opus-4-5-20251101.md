# Inversion of Control

Question: What is the primary purpose of the IoC container in the Inversion of Control design pattern?

- [ ] To compile source code into executable binaries
- [ ] To directly call methods and tightly couple objects together
- [ ] To instantiate, manage, and control the lifecycle of objects while mediating communication between them
- [ ] To store application data in a persistent database

  <p>To instantiate, manage, and control the lifecycle of objects while mediating communication between them</p>
  <p>The IoC container serves as a mediator that controls the flow of communication between objects. It is responsible for instantiating, managing, and controlling the lifecycle of objects, which enables loose coupling between components. This is in contrast to traditional programming where objects directly call methods on each other, creating tight coupling.</p>
