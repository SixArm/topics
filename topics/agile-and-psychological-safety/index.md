# Agile and psychological safety

Agile requires psychological safety as a cornerstone for success. Psychological safety means team members feel secure to take risks, make mistakes, and voice concerns without fear of negative consequences. In agile methodologies, this concept becomes particularly crucial as teams are expected to adapt quickly, experiment with new approaches, deliberately take risks and make mistakes, and continuously improve. When teams operate with high psychological safety, they demonstrate increased creativity, better problem-solving capabilities, and stronger commitment to collective success.

When psychological safety is present, then stakeholders are more likely to openly discuss technical challenges, admit when they don't understand requirements, and propose innovative solutions. This transparency directly supports agile principles such as individuals and interactions over processes and tools, and responding to change over following a plan. Team members become more willing to participate actively in communications, collaborations, evaluations, reflections, and decisions.

When psychological safety is not present, then stakeholders are more likely to hide problems, avoid necessary risks, decline to explore, skip systems thinking, or fail to communicate critical issues that could derail goals.

Creating psychological safety in agile environments requires intentional leadership practices, including encouraging experimentation, celebrating intelligent failures, and fostering open communication. Scrum masters and product owners play vital roles in modeling vulnerability, asking for feedback, and ensuring all stakeholder voices are heard and evaluated.
