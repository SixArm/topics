  <p>It enables team members to take risks, admit mistakes, and voice concerns without fear of negative consequences</p>
  <p>Psychological safety is a cornerstone of agile success because it allows team members to feel secure when experimenting, making mistakes, and openly discussing challenges. This directly supports agile principles by fostering transparency, encouraging innovation, and enabling continuous improvement. Without psychological safety, stakeholders tend to hide problems, avoid necessary risks, and fail to communicate critical issues that could derail goals.</p>
