  <p>Fixed costs are spread over a larger production volume</p>
  <p>Economies of scale achieve cost advantages because as production volume increases, fixed costs (such as facilities, equipment, and overhead) are distributed across more units of output. This spreading of fixed costs results in a decrease in the average cost per unit, making larger-scale operations more cost-efficient than smaller ones.</p>
