  <p>Analyzing transaction data and identifying suspicious activities to support AML and KYC requirements</p>
  <p>AI in fintech plays a critical role in regulatory compliance by analyzing large volumes of transaction data to detect patterns indicative of money laundering, fraud, or other suspicious activities. This helps financial institutions meet anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulatory requirements more efficiently and accurately than manual review processes.</p>
