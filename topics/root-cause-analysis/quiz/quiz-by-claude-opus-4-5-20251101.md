  <p>To identify underlying causes and prevent similar problems from recurring</p>
  <p>Root cause analysis aims to identify the underlying causes of a problem rather than just treating symptoms. The purpose is to implement targeted solutions that eliminate the root cause and prevent similar problems from happening in the future. This distinguishes RCA from reactive troubleshooting, which focuses on immediate symptom relief rather than long-term prevention.</p>
