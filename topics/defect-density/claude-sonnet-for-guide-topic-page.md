# Defect density

Defect density is a metric in software testing automation that measures the number of defects identified per unit of code, typically expressed as defects per thousand lines of code (KLOC) or defects per function point. This quantitative measure helps organizations assess software quality, evaluate testing effectiveness, and make informed decisions about release readiness.

Calculating defect density involves dividing the total number of defects found by the size of the software component being measured. For example, if 50 defects are discovered in 10,000 lines of code, the defect density would be 5 defects per KLOC.

In automated testing environments, defect density provides objective insights into code quality trends over time. The metric enables teams to compare defect rates across different modules, releases, or development phases, helping identify problematic areas that require additional attention.

Test automation significantly impacts defect density measurement by enabling more comprehensive and consistent defect detection. Automated regression testing can quickly identify new defects introduced during code changes, while continuous integration pipelines can track defect density trends in real-time. However, it's important to note that defect density should be interpreted alongside other quality metrics, as a low defect density doesn't necessarily guarantee high software quality â€“ it might simply indicate insufficient test coverage or ineffective testing strategies.
