# Defect density

Question: How is defect density calculated in software testing?

- [ ] By counting the total number of test cases executed per release cycle
- [ ] By dividing the total number of defects found by the size of the software component (e.g., per KLOC)
- [ ] By measuring the time required to fix each identified defect
- [ ] By comparing the number of automated tests to manual tests

  <p>By dividing the total number of defects found by the size of the software component (e.g., per KLOC)</p>
  <p>Defect density is calculated by dividing the total number of defects found by the size of the software component being measured, typically expressed as defects per thousand lines of code (KLOC) or defects per function point. For example, if 50 defects are discovered in 10,000 lines of code, the defect density would be 5 defects per KLOC.</p>
