  <p>Multi-modal Datasets</p>
  <p>Multi-modal datasets combine data from different modalities, such as text, images, and audio. They are used for tasks that require the model to process and understand information from multiple sources. Examples include the Multi30K dataset and the VQA (Visual Question Answering) dataset. This concept is increasingly important as modern AI systems need to integrate and reason across different types of data to solve complex real-world problems.</p>
