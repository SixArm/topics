  <p>A minor usability issue that, while small individually, can collectively impact user experience</p>
  <p>A paper cut bug refers to small design flaws or inconsistencies—such as misaligned elements, unclear error messages, or lack of visual feedback—that may seem insignificant on their own but accumulate to negatively affect the overall user experience. The term evokes how a single paper cut is minor, but many small cuts become painful.</p>
