  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Utilization of service facilities</p>
  <p>Utilization measures the proportion of time that service facilities are actively serving customers versus being idle. It is a critical metric for capacity planning because it helps organizations determine whether they have too many resources (low utilization, wasted cost) or too few resources (high utilization, long queues). Understanding utilization enables technology professionals to optimize system resources in areas like server capacity, network bandwidth, and processing throughput.</p>
