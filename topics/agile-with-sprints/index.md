# Agile with sprints

Agile sprints are time-boxed iterations that form the backbone of agile software development methodologies, particularly Scrum. These focused work periods typically last between one to four weeks, with two weeks being the most common duration. During each sprint, development teams commit to completing a specific set of features or user stories from the product backlog, creating a potentially shippable product increment by the end of the iteration.

The sprint process begins with sprint planning, where the team selects backlog items and breaks them down into manageable tasks. Throughout the sprint, team members collaborate daily through brief stand-up meetings to share progress, identify obstacles, and maintain alignment. The development work follows agile principles, emphasizing collaboration, adaptive planning, and continuous feedback rather than rigid documentation and lengthy planning phases.

Each sprint concludes with two key ceremonies: the sprint review and sprint retrospective. The sprint review demonstrates completed work to stakeholders, gathering feedback that influences future development priorities. The retrospective allows the team to reflect on their process, identifying what worked well and areas for improvement in upcoming sprints.

The sprint structure provides numerous benefits, including predictable delivery cycles, increased transparency, and rapid response to changing requirements. Teams can adjust their approach based on lessons learned, market feedback, or shifting business priorities without waiting for lengthy development cycles to complete. This iterative approach reduces risk by delivering working software frequently, enabling early detection of issues and ensuring the final product better meets user needs. The time-boxed nature also helps teams maintain focus and momentum while preventing scope creep during development phases.
