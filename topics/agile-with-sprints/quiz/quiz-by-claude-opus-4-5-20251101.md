  <p>To enable predictable delivery cycles, maintain focus, and prevent scope creep</p>
  <p>Time-boxed sprints provide numerous benefits including predictable delivery cycles, increased transparency, and rapid response to changing requirements. The fixed duration helps teams maintain focus and momentum while preventing scope creep during development phases. This iterative approach reduces risk by delivering working software frequently, enabling early detection of issues and ensuring the final product better meets user needs.</p>
