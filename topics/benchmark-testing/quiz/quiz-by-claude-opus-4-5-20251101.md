# Benchmark testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of benchmark testing in technology systems?

- [ ] To verify that software is free of security vulnerabilities
- [ ] To ensure code follows proper naming conventions and style guidelines
- [ ] To compare system performance against a standard reference point and identify areas for improvement

  <p>To compare system performance against a standard reference point and identify areas for improvement</p>
  <p>Benchmark testing (benchmarking) is fundamentally about evaluating the speed, efficiency, and overall performance of a system or application by comparing it against a standard or reference point. This comparison helps identify performance gaps and areas where optimization is needed. While other types of testing focus on security, style, or design compliance, benchmark testing specifically addresses performance measurement and comparison.</p>
