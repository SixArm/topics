  <p>To create a shared understanding of the project vision, goals, and plan among team members</p>
  <p>Liftoff is the initial stage of a project where the team comes together to define and align on the project's goals, objectives, and initial plan. This stage is critical because it sets the foundation for the entire project by ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of what they're working toward. The term conveys that the project is just getting off the ground, and the team needs to work together to achieve alignment before moving forward.</p>
