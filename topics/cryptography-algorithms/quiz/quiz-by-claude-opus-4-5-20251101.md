# Cryptography algorithms

Question: What is the key difference between symmetric key algorithms and asymmetric key algorithms?

- [ ] Symmetric algorithms are slower but more secure than asymmetric algorithms
- [ ] Asymmetric algorithms use a single shared key, while symmetric algorithms use two keys
- [ ] Symmetric algorithms use one key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric algorithms use a public/private key pair
- [ ] Symmetric algorithms can only encrypt text, while asymmetric algorithms can encrypt any data type

  <p>Symmetric algorithms use one key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric algorithms use a public/private key pair</p>
  <p>Symmetric key algorithms (like AES) use the same secret key for both encrypting and decrypting data, making them fast but requiring secure key exchange. Asymmetric key algorithms (like RSA) use two mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This fundamental distinction affects their use cases—symmetric for bulk data encryption due to speed, and asymmetric for secure key exchange and digital signatures.</p>
