# Agile vs Spiral

Question: What is the fundamental difference between how Agile and Spiral methodologies approach risk management?

- [ ] Both methodologies ignore risk management entirely and focus only on delivery speed
- [ ] Agile requires formal risk analysis at each phase, while Spiral relies on organic feedback loops
- [ ] Spiral conducts formal risk analysis at each phase, while Agile addresses risks organically through frequent feedback and adaptation
- [ ] Agile and Spiral use identical risk management processes but differ only in team size requirements

  <p>Spiral conducts formal risk analysis at each phase, while Agile addresses risks organically through frequent feedback and adaptation</p>
  <p>The Spiral model emphasizes systematic risk analysis through its four iterative phases (planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation), making it ideal for large, complex, and safety-critical projects. Agile, in contrast, treats risk management more organically by relying on frequent stakeholder feedback, rapid iteration, and continuous adaptation to address issues as they emerge rather than through formal analysis processes.</p>
