# Agile vs Spiral

Agile and Spiral are two software development methodologies that approach project management and risk mitigation differently. 

The Agile methodology emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery. Agile focuses on responding to change, delivering working software frequently, and maintaining close collaboration with stakeholders.

The Spiral model emphasizes risk analysis through iterative cycles that spiral outward. Each spiral consists of four phases: planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. This methodology is particularly well-suited for large, complex projects where risks need to be identified and addressed systematically throughout development.

The key differences lie in their approach to risk and planning. Spiral methodology conducts formal risk analysis at each phase, making it ideal for projects with safety-critical requirements. Agile treats risk management more organically, relying on frequent feedback and adaptation to address issues as they arise. Spiral requires more extensive documentation and formal processes, while Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation.
