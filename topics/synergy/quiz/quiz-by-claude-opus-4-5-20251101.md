  <p>The phenomenon where combined efforts produce results exceeding individual contributions alone</p>
  <p>Synergy refers to the phenomenon where combined efforts or resources of individuals or elements produce results that are greater than the sum of their individual contributions. This core concept emphasizes that collaboration and cooperation can amplify impact, leading to outcomes—such as greater productivity, efficiency, or innovation—that would not be achievable through individual efforts working in isolation.</p>
