  <p>Nurturing relationships with existing clients to ensure their satisfaction, retention, and long-term success</p>
  <p>An Account Manager (AM) is a company role typically found in sales, customer success, or client services departments. Their core responsibility is to serve as the main point of contact for assigned client accounts, focusing on client relationship management, client success, account planning, conflict management, and renewals—all centered on maintaining and growing existing client relationships rather than acquiring new ones.</p>
