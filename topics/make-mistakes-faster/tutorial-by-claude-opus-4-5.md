## Make Mistakes Faster

"Make mistakes faster" is a philosophy attributed to Andy Grove, the legendary former CEO of Intel. This principle challenges conventional wisdom about failure and reframes mistakes as accelerators of learning and innovation rather than setbacks to be avoided.

## The Core Philosophy

The traditional approach to work emphasizes careful planning to avoid errors. "Make mistakes faster" inverts this thinking: if mistakes are inevitable on the path to success, then the speed at which you make and learn from them determines how quickly you succeed.

This philosophy rests on three fundamental truths:

- **Mistakes are information.** Every failure reveals something that doesn't work, narrowing the path toward what does.
- **Time spent avoiding mistakes is time not spent learning.** Excessive caution creates paralysis.
- **Early mistakes cost less than late ones.** Discovering a flaw in week two is far cheaper than discovering it in month six.

## Why Speed Matters

The velocity of mistake-making directly correlates with the velocity of improvement. Consider two teams working on identical problems:

| Team A | Team B |
|--------|--------|
| Spends 3 weeks planning to avoid errors | Spends 1 week planning, then executes |
| Makes first mistake at week 4 | Makes first mistake at week 2 |
| Learns one lesson per month | Learns three lessons per month |
| Ships refined product at month 6 | Ships refined product at month 3 |

Team B accumulates more learning in half the time. Their product isn't perfect, but they've iterated through more cycles of feedback and improvement.

## Practical Application

Applying this philosophy requires specific behavioral changes:

- **Reduce batch sizes.** Work in smaller increments so failures are contained and lessons are immediate.
- **Shorten feedback loops.** Deploy to production frequently. Show work to users early. Get reviews before code is "ready."
- **Lower the stakes of failure.** Build systems where mistakes are recoverable: feature flags, rollbacks, A/B testing, and staging environments.
- **Document and share failures.** Create blameless post-mortems. Make failure a source of organizational learning, not individual shame.
- **Distinguish reversible from irreversible decisions.** Move fast on reversible decisions; apply more caution only where consequences are permanent.

## Relationship to Fail Fast, Fail Often

"Make mistakes faster" is closely related to the "fail fast, fail often" philosophy popularized in Silicon Valley. Both share the same DNA:

| Concept | Emphasis |
|---------|----------|
| Make mistakes faster | Speed of iteration and learning velocity |
| Fail fast | Quick detection of failures; early termination of bad paths |
| Fail often | Volume of experiments; normalizing failure as routine |

Together, these principles form a cohesive approach: run many experiments, detect failures quickly, extract lessons immediately, and move on without dwelling.

## When This Philosophy Applies

This approach is most powerful in:

- **Product development.** Where user feedback invalidates assumptions constantly.
- **Innovation and R&D.** Where the solution space is unknown.
- **Startups.** Where speed to market and rapid learning determine survival.
- **Software engineering.** Where continuous integration and deployment make iteration cheap.

It applies less directly in contexts where mistakes have severe, irreversible consequences—surgery, aviation, nuclear safety. Even there, however, simulation and training environments allow practitioners to make mistakes faster in safe contexts before operating in high-stakes ones.

## Common Misunderstandings

This philosophy is frequently misinterpreted:

- **It does not mean being reckless.** The goal is rapid learning, not careless execution. Each mistake should teach something.
- **It does not mean ignoring quality.** Speed comes from smaller iterations, not from abandoning standards.
- **It does not mean making the same mistake repeatedly.** The emphasis is on faster, not more. Learning must follow each failure.
- **It does not eliminate planning.** Planning still happens—just in shorter cycles with faster validation.

## Organizational Requirements

For teams to make mistakes faster, organizations must create enabling conditions:

- **Psychological safety.** People must feel safe admitting errors without career consequences.
- **Blame-free culture.** Focus on systemic causes, not individual fault.
- **Infrastructure for experimentation.** Tools that make testing, deploying, and rolling back easy.
- **Metrics that reward learning.** Measure iteration velocity and lessons learned, not just outcomes.

## The Competitive Advantage

Organizations that embrace this philosophy outpace competitors not by being smarter, but by learning faster. In uncertain environments, the ability to rapidly test hypotheses, discover what doesn't work, and converge on what does creates a compounding advantage.

The question isn't whether you'll make mistakes—you will. The question is whether you'll make them fast enough to learn before your window of opportunity closes.
