# Make mistakes faster

## Introduction

"Make mistakes faster" is a principle attributed to Andy Grove, the legendary CEO of Intel, that captures a fundamental truth about learning and innovation in technology. The phrase is not an invitation to be reckless. It is a deliberate strategy for accelerating feedback loops, compressing learning cycles, and building resilience into teams and products. For technology professionals, where the cost of inaction often exceeds the cost of a recoverable error, this mindset transforms how individuals and organizations approach risk, experimentation, and growth.

## Origin and Context

Andy Grove led Intel through some of the most turbulent periods in the semiconductor industry. His management philosophy centered on confronting reality head-on, making decisions with incomplete information, and treating mistakes as data rather than disasters. The phrase "make mistakes faster" emerged from this culture of disciplined urgency. Grove understood that in fast-moving markets, the team that learns quickest wins, not the team that avoids all errors.

The idea gained broader traction alongside the rise of lean startup methodology, agile development, and the Silicon Valley ethos of rapid iteration. Today it is foundational to how high-performing technology organizations operate.

## Core Principles

The "make mistakes faster" philosophy rests on several interlocking principles:

- **Speed of learning matters more than avoidance of failure.** Every mistake contains information. The faster you surface that information, the sooner you can act on it.
- **Small, frequent failures prevent large, catastrophic ones.** By testing assumptions early, you avoid investing months or years into a flawed direction.
- **Psychological safety enables speed.** Teams that punish mistakes slow down. Teams that treat mistakes as learning opportunities accelerate.
- **Iteration beats perfection.** Shipping a rough version and improving it based on real feedback consistently outperforms waiting to ship a polished version based on assumptions.
- **Bias toward action reduces analysis paralysis.** Making a decision, observing the result, and correcting course is often faster than exhaustive upfront analysis.

## Traditional Thinking vs. Make Mistakes Faster

| Dimension | Traditional Approach | Make Mistakes Faster |
|---|---|---|
| Risk attitude | Minimize all risk before proceeding | Accept calculated risk to accelerate learning |
| Decision timing | Delay until certainty is high | Decide early with partial information, then adapt |
| Failure response | Assign blame, avoid recurrence at all costs | Conduct blameless analysis, extract lessons, move on |
| Planning horizon | Lengthy upfront planning phases | Short iterations with frequent checkpoints |
| Quality strategy | Get it right the first time | Get it out, get feedback, get it right quickly |
| Success metric | Absence of errors | Speed of learning and adaptation |
| Team culture | Caution and conformity | Experimentation and psychological safety |

## How Technology Professionals Apply This

### In Software Development

Agile and lean methodologies embed "make mistakes faster" directly into their workflows. Continuous integration, automated testing, feature flags, and canary deployments all exist to make it safe and cheap to fail in small, contained ways. A developer who ships a feature behind a flag, observes real user behavior, and iterates in days has made mistakes faster than a team that spends months in design review before writing a line of code.

### In Product Management

Product managers apply this principle through rapid prototyping, minimum viable products, and structured experiments. Rather than building a complete product based on assumptions about what customers want, they build the smallest thing that tests the riskiest assumption, measure the result, and pivot or persevere based on evidence.

### In Leadership and Decision-Making

Technology leaders apply this principle by setting clear decision-making frameworks, empowering teams to act without seeking approval for every choice, and running blameless retrospectives when things go wrong. The goal is to create an environment where the cost of a mistake is low and the speed of recovery is high.

## The Feedback Loop

The power of making mistakes faster comes from tightening the feedback loop. The cycle looks like this:

- **Hypothesize.** State what you believe to be true and what you expect to happen.
- **Act.** Execute the smallest possible experiment to test the hypothesis.
- **Observe.** Measure the outcome honestly, including outcomes you did not expect.
- **Learn.** Extract the lesson. What did you get wrong? What did you get right?
- **Adjust.** Change your approach based on what you learned, then repeat.

The shorter each cycle, the more cycles you complete in a given period, and the faster you converge on the right answer.

## Common Misconceptions

Several misunderstandings can undermine the intent of this principle:

- **It does not mean being careless.** Making mistakes faster requires discipline, not recklessness. Each experiment should be designed to minimize blast radius while maximizing learning.
- **It does not mean ignoring known risks.** If you already know something will fail, doing it anyway is not learning; it is waste. The principle applies to genuine uncertainty.
- **It does not mean skipping due diligence.** In domains with high stakes and low reversibility, such as security, compliance, or data integrity, the principle applies to how you test, not whether you test.
- **It does not mean tolerating repeated mistakes.** Making the same mistake twice is not faster learning. It is failure to learn from the first instance.

## Conditions for Success

For this philosophy to work, certain conditions must be in place:

- **Psychological safety.** Team members must feel safe reporting mistakes without fear of punishment.
- **Fast feedback mechanisms.** Automated tests, monitoring, observability, and user analytics reduce the time between action and insight.
- **Small batch sizes.** Smaller changes are easier to test, easier to revert, and easier to learn from.
- **Blameless retrospectives.** Post-incident reviews should focus on systemic improvements, not individual fault.
- **Clear boundaries.** Teams need to know which mistakes are acceptable experiments and which cross into unacceptable risk.

These related concepts provide complementary frameworks for turning rapid experimentation into sustained competitive advantage.

## Summary

"Make mistakes faster" is a strategic discipline, not a casual attitude toward error. It recognizes that in technology, where uncertainty is high and change is constant, the speed at which you learn determines how quickly you succeed. By designing small experiments, shortening feedback loops, creating psychological safety, and treating every failure as actionable data, technology professionals and their organizations convert mistakes from setbacks into accelerants. The goal is never to fail for its own sake. The goal is to learn faster than the competition.
