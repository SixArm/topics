# Test data

Question: What is the primary purpose of using test data (test set) in machine learning?

- [ ] To train the model on as much data as possible
- [ ] To provide an unbiased estimate of model performance on unseen data
- [ ] To store the model's hyperparameters for future use
- [ ] To increase the speed of the training process

  <p>To provide an unbiased estimate of model performance on unseen data</p>
  <p>Test data is a separate subset of data used to evaluate how well a trained model can generalize to new, unseen data. It serves as an independent measure of model performance and helps ensure the model is not overfitting—where it memorizes patterns from training data rather than learning meaningful patterns that apply to real-world scenarios.</p>
