  <p>The benefits and solutions provided to customers</p>
  <p>A strong value proposition should focus on the benefits and solutions a company can provide, rather than just the features of its product or service. It should be specific and measurable, highlighting the outcomes and results that customers can expect. This customer-centric approach helps differentiate a company from competitors and communicates unique selling points to potential customers.</p>
