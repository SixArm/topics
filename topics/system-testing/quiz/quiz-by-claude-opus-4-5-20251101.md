  <p>To verify the entire system's behavior and functionality as a whole</p>
  <p>System testing evaluates and verifies the complete system's behavior, ensuring all software components work together correctly and satisfy system requirements. Unlike unit testing (which tests individual components in isolation), system testing examines the integrated system to identify defects and confirm the system operates as expected. This includes functional, performance, security, usability, compatibility, and regression testing.</p>
