# Agile Principle 11: Self-organizing

  <p>Team members closest to the work have the deepest understanding of technical challenges and user needs</p>
  <p>Agile Principle 11 recognizes that developers, testers, and other team members possess the deepest understanding of technical challenges and user needs because they are closest to the actual work. This principle shifts the role of traditional architects and managers from decision-makers to facilitators and coaches, enabling collaborative emergence rather than imposed solutions. Self-organization doesn't mean chaos—it still requires appropriate skills, clear goals, supportive culture, and alignment with business objectives.</p>
