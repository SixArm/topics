# Agile principle 11: Self-organizing

"The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."

This principle recognizes that the people closest to the actual work—the developers, testers, and other team members—possess the deepest understanding of technical challenges and user needs. This principle shifts the role of traditional architects and managers from decision-makers to facilitators and coaches, creating collaborative emergence rather than imposed solutions.

Self-organizing teams operate with minimal external direction, taking collective ownership of decisions about how to structure their code, define requirements, and create system designs. Rather than having architects or managers dictate these elements from above, teams collaborate to evolve solutions that best fit their specific context and constraints. This approach leverages the collective intelligence and diverse perspectives of all team members, leading to more innovative and practical solutions.

The principle acknowledges that software development is inherently complex and unpredictable, making it difficult for any single person or external authority to predetermine the optimal approach. When teams have the freedom to experiment, adapt, and refine their architectural decisions continuously, they can respond more effectively to changing requirements and emerging technical insights.

However, self-organization doesn't mean chaos or absence of guidance. Successful implementation requires teams with appropriate skills, clear goals, and supportive organizational culture. Teams must also maintain communication with stakeholders and align their decisions with broader business objectives.
