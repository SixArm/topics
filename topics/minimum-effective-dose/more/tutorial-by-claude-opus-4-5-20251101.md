## Minimum Effective Dose (MED)

The Minimum Effective Dose (MED) is the smallest amount of input, effort, or intervention required to produce a desired outcome. Originating from pharmacology, this principle has become a foundational concept in technology, product development, project management, and personal productivity.

For technology professionals, understanding MED means recognizing that more effort, more features, and more complexity do not automatically translate to better results. The goal is to identify the precise threshold where additional input stops producing meaningful returns.

## Origins and Core Principle

The concept emerged from medical research, where determining the lowest effective drug dosage minimizes side effects while maintaining therapeutic benefits. Tim Ferriss popularized the term in technology and productivity circles, applying it to fitness, learning, and business optimization.

The core principle states: **anything beyond the minimum effective dose is waste**. Water boils at 100°C. Heating it to 150°C does not make it "more boiled"—it simply wastes energy.

## MED in Software Development

Technology professionals encounter MED decisions constantly. The principle applies across multiple domains:

| Domain | MED Application | Common Waste |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Feature Development | Build only what solves the user problem | Gold-plating, speculative features |
| Testing | Test coverage that catches meaningful bugs | 100% coverage on trivial code |
| Documentation | Docs that answer actual questions | Comprehensive docs nobody reads |
| Meetings | Shortest meeting that achieves the goal | Hour-long meetings by default |
| Code Review | Reviews that catch real issues | Bikeshedding on style preferences |
| Infrastructure | Resources that handle actual load | Over-provisioning "just in case" |

## MED vs. MVP

Minimum Effective Dose and Minimum Viable Product share philosophical roots but serve different purposes:

| Aspect | Minimum Effective Dose | Minimum Viable Product |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Focus | Optimal efficiency for any action | Product validation strategy |
| Scope | Universal principle | Product development specific |
| Goal | Eliminate waste while achieving outcome | Learn from users with minimal investment |
| Timeframe | Applies to every decision | Early product lifecycle |
| Measurement | Outcome achieved vs. input required | User feedback and learning |

An MVP is one application of MED thinking: what is the minimum product that effectively tests our hypothesis?

## Applying MED to Technical Decisions

### Architecture and Design

- Choose the simplest architecture that meets current requirements
- Avoid premature optimization—measure first, optimize the bottleneck
- Select technologies your team knows unless compelling reasons exist to learn new ones
- Design for current scale with clear paths to scale later

### Code Quality

- Write code that is readable and maintainable, not clever
- Refactor when complexity impedes progress, not preemptively
- Add abstractions when you have three concrete examples, not one
- Comment why, not what—the code shows what

### Process and Methodology

- Adopt practices that solve problems you actually have
- Start with lightweight processes and add structure when needed
- Measure what matters, not everything measurable
- Automate repetitive tasks that consume meaningful time

## Benefits of MED Thinking

**Faster delivery**: Eliminating unnecessary work accelerates completion.

**Reduced risk**: Less complexity means fewer failure points.

**Better focus**: Teams concentrate on high-impact activities.

**Resource efficiency**: Time and money go toward outcomes, not busywork.

**Improved sustainability**: Avoiding overwork prevents burnout.

**Clearer priorities**: MED forces explicit decisions about what matters.

## Common Anti-Patterns

Technology professionals frequently violate MED principles through:

- **Premature generalization**: Building frameworks before understanding the problem
- **Feature creep**: Adding capabilities nobody requested
- **Over-engineering**: Designing for hypothetical scale or requirements
- **Meeting inflation**: Defaulting to meetings when async communication suffices
- **Documentation theater**: Writing docs to check boxes rather than help users
- **Metric obsession**: Tracking numbers that do not influence decisions

## How to Find Your MED

1. **Define the outcome precisely**: What specific result do you need?
2. **Identify the critical inputs**: What actions directly cause that outcome?
3. **Start minimal**: Begin with the smallest possible intervention
4. **Measure results**: Did you achieve the outcome?
5. **Adjust incrementally**: Add only if the outcome was not achieved
6. **Stop when effective**: Resist the urge to continue past effectiveness

## MED in Practice: Examples

**Code review**: Instead of reviewing every line, focus on logic errors, security issues, and maintainability concerns. Style issues belong in automated linters.

**Standup meetings**: If a team communicates well asynchronously, daily standups may exceed MED. Consider async updates or less frequent syncs.

**Test automation**: Prioritize tests for critical paths and regression-prone areas rather than pursuing arbitrary coverage percentages.

**Technical documentation**: Document decisions and non-obvious behavior. Skip documenting what the code clearly shows.

**Performance optimization**: Profile first. Optimize the actual bottleneck. One targeted fix often outperforms scattered micro-optimizations.

## Conclusion

The Minimum Effective Dose principle challenges the assumption that more is better. For technology professionals, it provides a framework for making better decisions about where to invest time, energy, and resources.

Mastering MED requires discipline—the discipline to stop when enough is enough, to resist gold-plating, and to accept that good enough often is. The most effective technologists are not those who do the most work, but those who identify and execute the work that matters.
