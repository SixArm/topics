  <p>Achieving desired outcomes with the smallest necessary intervention</p>
  <p>The Minimum Effective Dose principle is about efficiency and effectiveness—using the smallest amount of a stimulus or intervention that produces the desired outcome. This applies across domains including medicine (lowest therapeutic dosage), fitness (minimum exercise for positive impact), and productivity (focusing on essential tasks). The goal is to avoid wasteful efforts and resources while maximizing results.</p>
