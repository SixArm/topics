  <p>C-Corporations are subject to double taxation, where profits are taxed at the corporate level and dividends are taxed again when distributed to shareholders</p>
  <p>Unlike pass-through entities (sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-Corporations) where business income flows directly to owners' personal tax returns, C-Corporations are taxed as separate entities. The corporation first pays corporate income tax on its profits, and then shareholders pay personal income tax on any dividends they receive. This "double taxation" is one of the most significant considerations for technology professionals and founders when choosing a business structure, particularly when planning for venture capital funding or an eventual IPO, as C-Corps remain the preferred structure for investors despite this tax treatment.</p>
