# C-Corporation

A C-Corporation (C-Corp) is a legal business structure under the United States Internal Revenue Code in which a company is taxed as a separate entity from its owners. It is the default corporate designation assigned by the IRS when a business incorporates, and it is the structure used by the vast majority of large public companies, venture-backed startups, and multinational enterprises. For technology professionals, understanding the C-Corporation is essential because it is the entity type most commonly required by institutional investors, and it governs how equity compensation, stock option pools, and fundraising rounds are structured.

## How a C-Corporation Works

A C-Corporation is a distinct legal entity, separate from the individuals who own it. The corporation itself can enter into contracts, own property, incur debt, sue, and be sued. Ownership is represented by shares of stock. Shareholders elect a board of directors, which oversees strategy and appoints officers (such as a CEO and CFO) to manage daily operations.

When a company incorporates, it files articles of incorporation with a state government, most commonly Delaware due to its well-established corporate law and specialized Court of Chancery. The corporation then adopts bylaws, issues stock, and begins operating under the governance framework defined by those documents.

## Key Features

- **Separate legal entity**: The corporation exists independently of its founders and shareholders, which means it persists even if ownership changes.
- **Limited liability**: Shareholders are generally not personally liable for the debts or legal obligations of the corporation. Their risk is limited to the value of their investment.
- **Multiple classes of stock**: C-Corps can issue common stock and various classes of preferred stock, each with different rights regarding voting, dividends, and liquidation preferences.
- **Unlimited number of shareholders**: There is no cap on the number of shareholders, and shareholders can be individuals, other corporations, or foreign nationals.
- **Perpetual existence**: The corporation continues to exist until it is formally dissolved, regardless of changes in ownership or management.
- **Transferability of ownership**: Shares can be bought and sold, making it straightforward to transfer ownership interests.

## Tax Treatment and Double Taxation

The defining characteristic of a C-Corporation from a tax perspective is that it is taxed at the entity level. The corporation files its own federal tax return (IRS Form 1120) and pays corporate income tax on its net profits. When the corporation distributes profits to shareholders as dividends, those shareholders must report the dividends as personal income and pay individual income tax on them.

This creates what is known as **double taxation**: the same income is taxed once at the corporate level and again at the individual level when distributed. The current federal corporate tax rate is 21% (set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017), while qualified dividends are taxed at the individual's capital gains rate, which ranges from 0% to 20% depending on income.

| Tax Event | Who Pays | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Corporate profits | The corporation | 21% federal corporate rate |
| Dividends to shareholders | Individual shareholders | 0%–20% qualified dividend rate |
| Capital gains on stock sale | Individual shareholders | 0%–20% long-term capital gains rate |
| State corporate income tax | The corporation | Varies by state (0%–12%) |

For many technology startups, double taxation is less of a practical concern in the early years because the company reinvests profits rather than distributing dividends. The structural advantages of the C-Corp for fundraising and equity compensation typically outweigh the tax disadvantage.

## C-Corporation vs. Other Business Structures

| Feature | C-Corporation | S-Corporation | LLC (Partnership-Taxed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Taxation | Entity-level (double taxation) | Pass-through to shareholders | Pass-through to members |
| Number of shareholders | Unlimited | Maximum 100 | Unlimited members |
| Shareholder types | Individuals, entities, foreign nationals | U.S. citizens and residents only | Individuals, entities, foreign nationals |
| Stock classes | Multiple classes allowed | One class only | Flexible allocation of profits |
| Venture capital eligibility | Yes (strongly preferred) | Rarely accepted | Sometimes accepted |
| Stock options (ISOs) | Yes | Yes | Not applicable (units/interests instead) |
| IPO readiness | Yes | Must convert before IPO | Must convert before IPO |
| Self-employment tax on profits | No (shareholders are not self-employed) | Varies | Often applies to active members |

## Why Technology Startups Choose C-Corporations

The C-Corporation is the dominant structure for venture-backed technology companies for several concrete reasons:

- **Investor requirements**: Venture capital firms, which are typically structured as limited partnerships, strongly prefer (and often require) portfolio companies to be C-Corps. The pass-through taxation of an S-Corp or LLC would create unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) problems for tax-exempt limited partners such as pension funds and university endowments.
- **Equity compensation**: C-Corps can grant incentive stock options (ISOs), which receive favorable tax treatment for employees. ISOs allow employees to defer tax until they sell the underlying shares, and if holding period requirements are met, gains are taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate rather than as ordinary income.
- **Preferred stock**: Investors in venture rounds receive preferred stock with specific rights such as liquidation preferences, anti-dilution protections, and board seats. The ability to issue multiple classes of stock is essential to structuring these deals.
- **Path to IPO or acquisition**: Public markets and acquirers expect C-Corp structures. Companies organized as S-Corps or LLCs must convert before an IPO, which adds complexity and cost.
- **409A valuations**: C-Corps establish fair market value of common stock through 409A valuations, which is the standard mechanism for pricing stock options granted to employees.

## Formation and Compliance Requirements

Forming a C-Corporation involves several steps and ongoing obligations:

- **Articles of incorporation**: Filed with the state of incorporation (commonly Delaware), specifying the corporation's name, registered agent, number of authorized shares, and par value.
- **Bylaws**: Internal governance document that defines procedures for board meetings, officer roles, voting procedures, and record-keeping.
- **Board of directors**: Must be elected by shareholders. The board is responsible for major corporate decisions, including appointing officers.
- **Annual meetings**: Shareholders and directors must hold annual meetings and document decisions through formal minutes.
- **Annual reports and franchise taxes**: Most states require annual filings and payment of franchise taxes. Delaware charges a franchise tax based on authorized shares or assumed par value capital.
- **Corporate records**: The corporation must maintain records of stock issuances, meeting minutes, board resolutions, and financial statements.
- **State and federal tax filings**: The corporation files IRS Form 1120 annually and applicable state tax returns.

Failure to maintain these formalities can result in loss of limited liability protection (known as "piercing the corporate veil"), penalties, or administrative dissolution.

## Equity Compensation in a C-Corporation

For technology professionals, equity compensation is often the most personally significant aspect of the C-Corp structure. Common equity instruments include:

- **Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)**: Available only in C-Corps (and S-Corps). ISOs offer favorable tax treatment if the employee holds the shares for at least one year after exercise and two years after the grant date.
- **Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs/NQSOs)**: Can be granted to employees, contractors, and advisors. Taxed as ordinary income upon exercise on the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value.
- **Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs)**: Actual shares granted subject to a vesting schedule. Often used for founders at incorporation when the stock value is minimal.
- **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)**: Promises to deliver shares upon vesting. Common at later-stage and public companies. Taxed as ordinary income when shares are delivered.

The employee stock option pool is a critical component of startup capitalization. It is typically established before a funding round, and its size (often 10%–20% of fully diluted shares) is negotiated between founders and investors.

## Summary

A C-Corporation is a separate legal entity that provides limited liability to its shareholders, can issue multiple classes of stock, and is taxed independently from its owners. While it is subject to double taxation and carries more significant compliance obligations than simpler structures, it remains the standard entity type for venture-backed technology companies because it accommodates institutional investors, supports equity compensation programs like incentive stock options, and provides a clear path to public markets or acquisition. For technology professionals, whether as founders, employees receiving stock options, or investors, understanding the C-Corporation structure is fundamental to navigating startup economics and corporate governance.
