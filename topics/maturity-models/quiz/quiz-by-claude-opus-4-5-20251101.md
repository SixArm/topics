  <p>Organizations improve capabilities by progressing through a series of maturity levels</p>
  <p>The essential idea of maturity models is that an organization can improve its capabilities by moving through a series of maturity levels, where each level represents a higher degree of capability and maturity in terms of processes, practices, tools, and resources. This provides a roadmap for improvement and a framework for measuring progress, though the model must be adapted to fit each organization's unique needs.</p>
