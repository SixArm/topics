  <p>Problems to solve rather than lists of tasks to perform</p>
  <p>Agile teams are most effective when they are empowered to solve problems rather than simply executing predefined task lists. This approach encourages autonomy, creativity, and ownership, allowing teams to leverage their expertise to find the best solutions. It also supports the agile principle that teams should decide how to execute work, fostering innovation and continuous improvement.</p>
