# Agile teams checklist

Agile methodologies succeed or fail based on how well teams internalize agile values and translate them into daily practice. A checklist provides a concrete, actionable way to assess whether a team is genuinely operating in an agile manner or merely going through the motions of ceremonies without embodying the underlying principles. The following tutorial breaks down a well-known agile teams checklist, originally attributed to Mountain Goat Software, into practical categories that technology professionals can use for self-assessment, coaching, and continuous improvement.

## Problem Orientation Over Task Lists

One of the most fundamental shifts in agile thinking is moving teams from executing predefined task lists to solving meaningful problems. When teams are given problems rather than prescriptive instructions, they engage their creativity, domain expertise, and collaborative instincts to find the best solutions.

A problem-oriented team asks "what outcome do we need?" before asking "what steps do we follow?" This distinction matters because technology work is inherently complex. The best path forward is rarely obvious at the outset, and teams closest to the work are best positioned to determine how to achieve the desired result. Managers who hand down detailed task lists inadvertently strip teams of ownership and reduce their ability to adapt when circumstances change.

| Approach | Characteristics | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Task-oriented | Manager defines steps, team executes in order, deviations require approval | Predictable but rigid; innovation is suppressed |
| Problem-oriented | Team receives a goal, collaborates on approach, iterates based on learning | Adaptive and creative; higher engagement and ownership |

## Autonomy and Decision-Making

Agile teams must be empowered to make decisions without waiting for managerial approval on routine matters. This does not mean teams operate without guidance. It means that decision authority is distributed to the level where the most relevant information exists.

Key indicators of healthy autonomy include:

- Teams decide how to execute their work, choosing tools, techniques, and workflows that fit the problem at hand.
- Teams are generally able to make decisions without a manager's approval for day-to-day technical and process choices.
- Teams and their decision-makers understand the benefits, challenges, and risks of agile, ensuring that autonomy is exercised responsibly.

When autonomy is absent, teams become bottlenecked on approval chains, velocity drops, and the best engineers disengage. When autonomy is present but unguided, teams may drift from organizational goals. The balance lies in clear strategic direction combined with tactical freedom.

## Continuous Improvement and Learning

Agile is not a destination but a discipline of ongoing refinement. Teams must actively invest in their own growth across multiple dimensions: technical skills, process efficiency, and collaborative effectiveness.

- Teams adopt appropriate practices and improve them over time, rather than treating any single framework as a permanent solution.
- Teams actively seek ways to improve how they work and collaborate, often through retrospectives and experimentation.
- Teams seek to learn relevant, new skills that expand what the team can deliver.
- Teams continue to learn and improve a skill they have already mastered, pursuing depth as well as breadth.
- Teams have all received basic training on agile concepts, establishing a shared vocabulary and mental model.

The distinction between a stagnant team and a thriving one often comes down to whether improvement is treated as an occasional event or as part of the daily rhythm of work.

## Quality and Accountability

Delivering working software at a sustainable pace requires teams to hold themselves to high standards without relying on external enforcement. Agile teams own their quality.

- Teams responsibly deliver high quality work, treating quality as non-negotiable rather than a variable to trade against speed.
- Teams make every effort to fully complete all planned work, honoring their commitments to stakeholders and to each other.
- Teams are responsible for monitoring and managing their own performance, using metrics and feedback rather than waiting for management reviews.
- Teams admit challenges and mistakes openly, creating the transparency necessary for genuine improvement.

Accountability in an agile context is collective. When a defect ships, the team owns it. When a sprint goal is missed, the team retrospects on why. This shared responsibility builds trust both within the team and with stakeholders.

## Responsiveness and Adaptability

The ability to respond to change is a core agile value, and the checklist addresses this from multiple angles:

- Teams welcome rather than resist changing requirements, recognizing that new information is an opportunity to deliver greater value.
- Teams quickly act on stakeholder feedback to improve the product, closing the loop between discovery and delivery.
- Teams start work even when some open issues or questions remain, accepting ambiguity as a natural condition rather than a blocker.

| Behavior | Anti-Pattern | Agile Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Requirement changes | Treating change requests as scope creep to be resisted | Evaluating changes for value and incorporating them willingly |
| Stakeholder feedback | Collecting feedback but deferring action to future sprints | Acting on feedback promptly within the current iteration |
| Ambiguity | Refusing to start until every detail is specified | Beginning work with what is known and iterating as clarity emerges |

## Collaboration and Communication

Agile depends on high-bandwidth communication and a culture of openness. Isolated individuals producing components in silos is antithetical to agile delivery.

- Teams collaborate to finish items, swarming on work rather than protecting individual territories.
- Teams are willing to work outside their specialties to achieve team goals, valuing team success over personal comfort zones.
- Teams openly share new ideas, practices, and experiences with other teams, contributing to organizational learning.
- Teams working on a common product proactively coordinate their work, preventing integration surprises.
- Teams are rarely delayed waiting for work to be completed by another team, indicating healthy dependency management.
- Teams choose and use various ways of communicating, adapting their methods to the situation rather than defaulting to a single channel.

## Psychological Safety and Motivation

The final dimension of the checklist addresses the human foundation that makes everything else possible. Without psychological safety, teams cannot admit mistakes, raise concerns, or challenge assumptions.

- Teams feel safe to express dissenting views, which is essential for avoiding groupthink and catching problems early.
- Teams understand and are motivated by why they are performing their work, connecting daily tasks to meaningful outcomes.
- Teams take pride in their craft, bringing intrinsic motivation that no incentive structure can replicate.

Psychological safety is not about avoiding conflict. It is about ensuring that conflict is productive, that people can disagree without fear of retribution, and that the team's collective intelligence is fully engaged.

## Summary

The agile teams checklist distills the essence of effective agile practice into observable, assessable behaviors spanning problem orientation, autonomy, continuous improvement, quality ownership, adaptability, collaboration, and psychological safety. Rather than measuring agile adoption through ceremony compliance or tool usage, this checklist focuses on the cultural and behavioral indicators that distinguish genuinely agile teams from those merely performing agile rituals. Technology professionals can use it as a periodic self-assessment tool, a coaching framework, or a conversation starter for retrospectives, always with the understanding that the goal is not to check every box perfectly but to identify areas for deliberate, incremental improvement.
