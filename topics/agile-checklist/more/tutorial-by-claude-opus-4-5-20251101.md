## Agile Checklist

The agile checklist is a practical self-assessment tool that helps technology teams evaluate their adoption of agile principles. Developed by Mountain Goat Software, this checklist provides concrete indicators of agile maturity across team dynamics, decision-making, continuous improvement, and delivery practices.

## Purpose and Benefits

An agile checklist serves multiple purposes for technology professionals:

| Purpose | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Self-assessment | Teams can honestly evaluate their current agile practices |
| Gap identification | Highlights areas needing improvement |
| Onboarding tool | Helps new team members understand expectations |
| Retrospective guide | Provides structured topics for team reflection |
| Transformation tracking | Measures progress during agile adoption |

## Core Checklist Categories

The checklist items fall into distinct categories that represent different aspects of agile team behavior.

### Problem-Solving Orientation

Agile teams focus on outcomes rather than outputs. Key indicators:

- Teams have problems to solve rather than lists of tasks to perform
- Teams understand and are motivated by why they are performing their work
- Teams take pride in their craft

This orientation shifts team mindset from task completion to value delivery. When teams understand the problem they're solving, they make better decisions about implementation.

### Autonomy and Decision-Making

Self-organization is fundamental to agile. Healthy teams demonstrate:

- Teams are generally able to make decisions without a manager's approval
- Teams decide how to execute work
- Teams are responsible for monitoring and managing their own performance

| Traditional Teams | Agile Teams |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Wait for manager approval | Make decisions within boundaries |
| Follow prescribed processes | Choose appropriate practices |
| Report status upward | Self-monitor performance |
| Execute assigned tasks | Determine execution approach |

### Adaptability and Change

Embracing change distinguishes agile teams from traditional approaches:

- Teams welcome rather than resist changing requirements
- Teams quickly act on stakeholder feedback to improve the product
- Teams start work even when some open issues or questions remain

This adaptability requires psychological safety and a growth mindset. Teams that fear change or require complete certainty before starting will struggle with agile delivery.

### Collaboration and Communication

Effective collaboration spans both intra-team and inter-team dynamics:

- Teams collaborate to finish items
- Teams working on a common product proactively coordinate their work
- Teams openly share new ideas, practices, and experiences with other teams
- Teams choose and use various ways of communicating
- Teams are rarely delayed waiting for work to be completed by another team

### Continuous Improvement

Learning and improvement are ongoing commitments:

- Teams adopt appropriate practices and improve them over time
- Teams actively seek ways to improve how they work and collaborate
- Teams seek to learn relevant, new skills
- Teams continue to learn and improve a skill they've already mastered
- Teams are willing to work outside their specialties to achieve team goals

### Transparency and Accountability

Open communication builds trust:

- Teams admit challenges and mistakes
- Teams feel safe to express dissenting views
- Teams responsibly deliver high quality work
- Teams make every effort to fully complete all planned work
- Teams and their decision-makers understand the benefits, challenges, and risks of agile

## Using the Checklist

### Individual Assessment

Each team member independently rates each item. Common rating scales:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 1 | Rarely or never true |
| 2 | Sometimes true |
| 3 | Often true |
| 4 | Almost always true |

### Team Discussion

After individual ratings, the team discusses:

- Items with high variance between members
- Items with consistently low scores
- Root causes behind problem areas
- Specific actions to improve weak areas

### Periodic Review

Revisit the checklist regularly:

- During retrospectives
- Quarterly team health checks
- After major team changes
- When onboarding new members

## Common Anti-Patterns

When using the checklist, watch for these warning signs:

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Underlying Issue |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| Task factory | Focus on task lists rather than problems | Lack of product ownership |
| Permission culture | Waiting for approval on decisions | Insufficient trust or unclear boundaries |
| Silo mentality | Teams not sharing or coordinating | Incentive misalignment or competition |
| Blame culture | Hiding mistakes and challenges | Psychological unsafety |
| Skill hoarding | Unwillingness to work outside specialty | Performance metrics punishing learning |
| Analysis paralysis | Refusing to start with uncertainty | Fear of failure |

## Prerequisites for Success

The checklist assumes certain organizational conditions exist:

- **Training**: All team members have received basic agile training
- **Leadership support**: Decision-makers understand agile benefits, challenges, and risks
- **Psychological safety**: Team members feel safe expressing dissenting views
- **Clear purpose**: Teams understand why they are performing their work

Without these foundations, checking boxes becomes mechanical rather than meaningful.

## Relationship to Agile Principles

The checklist items map directly to the twelve principles behind the Agile Manifesto:

| Checklist Theme | Agile Principle |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Welcoming change | Harness change for competitive advantage |
| Stakeholder feedback | Deliver working software frequently |
| Team decision-making | Build projects around motivated individuals |
| Collaboration | Business people and developers work together |
| Quality focus | Continuous attention to technical excellence |
| Simplicity | Maximize work not done |
| Self-organization | Best work emerges from self-organizing teams |
| Continuous improvement | Regular reflection and adjustment |

## Practical Recommendations

For technology professionals implementing this checklist:

- Start with honest self-assessment, not aspirational scoring
- Focus on two or three improvement areas at a time
- Connect checklist items to specific, observable behaviors
- Celebrate progress on previously weak areas
- Involve the entire team in both assessment and action planning
- Treat the checklist as a conversation starter, not a compliance tool

The agile checklist provides a pragmatic framework for evaluating and improving team agility. Its value comes not from achieving perfect scores, but from the conversations and improvements it generates.
