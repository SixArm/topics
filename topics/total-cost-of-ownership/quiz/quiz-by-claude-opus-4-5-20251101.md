  <p>Financing costs, maintenance costs, operating costs, and disposal costs</p>
  <p>TCO is a comprehensive financial metric that calculates the total cost of owning and operating an asset over its entire lifecycle. The formula is: TCO = Purchase Price + Financing Costs + Maintenance Costs + Operating Costs + Disposal Costs. This provides a more complete view than simply looking at the purchase price, helping businesses make informed decisions about acquiring, maintaining, or disposing of assets.</p>
