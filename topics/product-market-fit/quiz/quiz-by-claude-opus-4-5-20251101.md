  <p>High customer retention and loyal users who continue using the product over time</p>
  <p>Customer retention is identified as one of the key indicators of product-market fit. When a product satisfies customers and meets their genuine needs, users become loyal and continue using the product over time. Other supporting indicators include positive customer reviews, increased referrals, and strong conversion rates—all of which demonstrate that the product effectively solves a real problem in the market.</p>
