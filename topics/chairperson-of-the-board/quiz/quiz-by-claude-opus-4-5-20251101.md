  <p>Leading the board of directors and providing oversight and guidance</p>
  <p>The Chairperson of the Board is responsible for leading the board of directors, running board meetings, setting agendas, facilitating communication between the board and organizational leadership, fostering board culture, overseeing board performance, and ensuring compliance with legal and ethical responsibilities. The COB does not manage day-to-day operations—that is typically the CEO's role.</p>
