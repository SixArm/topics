  <p>To provide a text alternative that allows users with visual impairments to understand image content</p>
  <p>The alt attribute is fundamentally an accessibility feature designed to provide a text description of an image so that users who are visually impaired or using assistive technologies like screen readers can understand and interpret the image's content and purpose. While alt text does provide SEO benefits and serves as a fallback when images fail to load, its primary purpose is accessibility compliance as specified by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>
