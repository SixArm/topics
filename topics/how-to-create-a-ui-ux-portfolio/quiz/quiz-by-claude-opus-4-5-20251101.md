  <p>Detailed case studies outlining the problem, your design process, and implemented solutions</p>
  <p>Case studies are essential because they demonstrate your ability to solve real-world problems through effective UI/UX design. They show potential employers or clients not just what you created, but how you approached the problem, your design decisions, and the reasoning behind your solutions. This provides much deeper insight into your capabilities than simply displaying finished work without context.</p>
