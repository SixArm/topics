# Q-learning

Question: What is a Q-value in the context of Q-learning?

- [ ] A table that stores all possible states the agent can encounter
- [ ] The probability of transitioning from one state to another
- [ ] The expected cumulative future reward of taking an action in a state and following the optimal policy thereafter
- [ ] The numerical penalty applied when the agent makes an incorrect decision

  <p>The expected cumulative future reward of taking an action in a state and following the optimal policy thereafter</p>
  <p>The Q-value (Q) represents the expected cumulative future reward of taking action a in state s and then following the optimal policy. Q-values are stored in a Q-table for all state-action pairs and are updated iteratively as the agent interacts with the environment, allowing the agent to learn which actions lead to maximum long-term rewards.</p>
