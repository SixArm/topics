# Training Data

Question: What is the primary purpose of splitting training data into subsets for training and validation?

- [ ] To reduce the overall size of the dataset for faster processing
- [ ] To create duplicate copies of data for backup purposes
- [ ] To monitor model performance and perform hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] To convert unlabeled data into labeled examples

  <p>To monitor model performance and perform hyperparameter tuning</p>
  <p>The validation set is used to evaluate how well the model generalizes during training, allowing practitioners to tune hyperparameters and detect issues like overfitting before deploying the model on unseen test data.</p>
