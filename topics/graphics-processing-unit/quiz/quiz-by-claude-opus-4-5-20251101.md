  <p>Parallel processing architecture with hundreds to thousands of cores</p>
  <p>GPUs are designed with hundreds to thousands of cores that allow them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This parallel architecture is well-suited for computationally heavy tasks because many operations can be processed concurrently, which is essential for the matrix multiplications and other operations common in AI and deep learning algorithms.</p>
