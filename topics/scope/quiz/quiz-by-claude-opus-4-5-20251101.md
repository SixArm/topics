  <p>The specific deliverables, objectives, tasks, and boundaries of a project</p>
  <p>Scope defines the work that needs to be done to accomplish a project's goals by specifying what is included and what is not included. It encompasses project objectives, deliverables, requirements, and limitations—establishing clear boundaries for the project rather than focusing solely on budget, team structure, or timeline.</p>
