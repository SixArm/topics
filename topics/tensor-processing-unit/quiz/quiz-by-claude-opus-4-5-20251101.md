  <p>An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) optimized for matrix multiplication and tensor operations</p>
  <p>TPUs are custom-designed ASICs created specifically to accelerate machine learning workloads. Their primary strength lies in efficiently performing large-scale matrix multiplication and tensor-related computations that are fundamental to training and inference in neural networks and deep learning models. Unlike general-purpose CPUs or GPUs, TPUs are purpose-built for these specific operations, making them highly efficient for AI workloads.</p>
