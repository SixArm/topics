# Agile with retrospectives

Agile retrospectives are structured meetings held at the end of each iteration, where team members reflect on their recent work experience and identify opportunities for improvement. These sessions typically follow a simple framework: examining what went well, what didn't go well, and what actions the team can take to improve in the next sprint.

The retrospective creates a safe space for honest dialogue where team members can voice concerns, celebrate successes, and collaboratively problem-solve. Common formats include the "Start, Stop, Continue" method, where teams discuss what they should start doing, stop doing, and continue doing, or the "Glad, Sad, Mad" approach that focuses on emotional responses to recent events.

Effective retrospectives require skilled facilitation to ensure all voices are heard and discussions remain constructive rather than becoming blame sessions. The facilitator guides the conversation, helps identify patterns in feedback, and ensures the team commits to specific, actionable improvements. Teams often use techniques like dot voting to prioritize which issues to address first.

Successful retrospectives result in concrete action items with clear owners and timelines. Without follow-through on these commitments, retrospectives become mere complaining sessions that erode team morale. When done well, they strengthen team bonds, improve processes, and contribute to higher-quality deliverables and increased job satisfaction.
