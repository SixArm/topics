  <p>Concrete action items with clear owners and timelines</p>
  <p>Without follow-through on commitments from retrospectives, they become mere complaining sessions that erode team morale. Successful retrospectives result in concrete action items with clear owners and timelines, which is what transforms reflection into actual process improvement and contributes to higher-quality deliverables and increased job satisfaction.</p>
