  <p>PPS programs pay affiliates only when a sale is completed through their link, while PPC programs pay for each click regardless of whether a sale occurs</p>
  <p>In pay-per-sale (PPS) affiliate programs, affiliates earn a commission only when a customer makes an actual purchase through their unique affiliate link. In contrast, pay-per-click (PPC) programs compensate affiliates for each click on their affiliate link, regardless of whether that click results in a sale. This distinction is critical for technology professionals evaluating affiliate partnerships, as it directly impacts revenue predictability and aligns incentives differently between merchants and affiliates.</p>
