  <p>Implementation demands commitment, perseverance, risk-taking, and attention to detail</p>
  <p>Implementation is hard because it requires sustained commitment, perseverance, attention to detail, and a willingness to take risks. Many ideas fail not due to their quality but because they lack necessary resources, skills, organizational support, or a culture of accountability. Success comes from careful planning, solid teams, and learning from failures through experimentation.</p>
