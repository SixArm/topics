# How to negotiate

Negotiation is one of the most consequential skills a technology professional can develop. Whether you are discussing compensation for a new role, defining scope with a client, resolving a conflict between engineering and product teams, or closing a vendor contract, the ability to negotiate effectively determines outcomes that compound over the course of a career. Negotiation is not about domination or trickery. It is a structured process of discovering interests, creating value, and reaching agreements that both parties can commit to with confidence.

## Why negotiation matters in technology

Technology professionals frequently underestimate how much of their work involves negotiation. Engineers negotiate deadlines, architects negotiate design trade-offs, managers negotiate headcount, and founders negotiate term sheets. The common assumption that technical merit alone drives decisions is incorrect. Decisions are made by people, and people respond to how proposals are framed, how trade-offs are presented, and how trust is established. Professionals who negotiate well earn more, ship better products, and build stronger teams.

## Preparation

Preparation is the single most important phase of any negotiation. Walking into a discussion without preparation means reacting instead of leading. Thorough preparation gives you clarity on what you want, knowledge of what the other party wants, and the flexibility to navigate toward a good outcome.

- **Define your goals**: Write down your ideal outcome, your acceptable outcome, and your walk-away point before the conversation begins.
- **Research the other party**: Understand their priorities, constraints, reporting structure, and decision-making authority. In a salary negotiation, research the company's compensation bands and recent funding. In a vendor negotiation, research their competitors.
- **Identify your BATNA**: Your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement is your source of power. If you have a strong alternative, you can negotiate from strength. If you do not, work on creating one before negotiating.
- **Anticipate objections**: List the most likely pushbacks and prepare responses. Rehearse them out loud with a trusted colleague if possible.
- **Gather supporting data**: In technology, decisions are often driven by metrics. Bring benchmarks, market rates, performance data, or case studies that support your position.

## Building rapport and trust

Negotiation is a conversation between people, not a transaction between positions. Establishing rapport early creates the conditions for honest exchange and creative problem-solving.

- Listen more than you speak. Ask open-ended questions and let the other party explain their perspective fully before responding.
- Find common ground. Shared goals, mutual frustrations, or aligned incentives provide a foundation for collaboration.
- Show respect for the other party's constraints. Acknowledging that someone has budget limits or organizational pressures does not weaken your position. It signals maturity and makes them more willing to work with you.
- Be direct and honest. Evasiveness erodes trust. State what you want clearly and explain why.

## Setting the agenda

Before diving into specifics, align on what will be discussed and how. An explicit agenda prevents important topics from being skipped and ensures both parties feel the process is fair.

- Propose an agenda collaboratively rather than dictating one.
- Define the scope of the negotiation: what is on the table and what is not.
- Agree on the timeframe for reaching a decision.
- Identify who has decision-making authority. Negotiating with someone who cannot approve the outcome wastes time for both sides.

## Bargaining strategies

Bargaining is the core exchange phase where proposals are made, modified, and refined. The most effective bargaining focuses on interests rather than fixed positions.

| Strategy | Description | Best Used When |
|---|---|---|
| Interest-based bargaining | Focus on underlying needs rather than stated demands. Ask "why" behind each position. | Both parties have complex, multi-dimensional needs. |
| Anchoring | Make the first offer to set the reference point for discussion. | You have strong data supporting your number and want to frame the range. |
| Logrolling | Trade concessions on issues you value less for gains on issues you value more. | Multiple issues are being negotiated simultaneously. |
| Bracketing | Propose a range where your target outcome falls in the middle. | You want flexibility while signaling your expectations. |
| Silence | After making a proposal, stop talking and let the other party respond. | The other party is likely to fill silence with concessions or information. |

Key principles during bargaining:

- Never negotiate against yourself. Make a proposal and wait for a counter.
- Seek win-win outcomes. Expanding the pie is almost always possible when you understand both parties' interests.
- Make concessions strategically. Each concession should be smaller than the last, and each should be exchanged for something of value.
- Avoid ultimatums unless you are genuinely prepared to walk away.

## Common negotiation scenarios for technology professionals

| Scenario | Key Considerations |
|---|---|
| Salary and compensation | Research market rates on Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, or Blind. Negotiate base, equity, signing bonus, and non-monetary benefits as a package, not individually. |
| Project scope and deadlines | Frame trade-offs explicitly: "We can deliver feature A and B by the deadline, or A, B, and C with two additional weeks." |
| Vendor and contract negotiations | Compare competing proposals. Negotiate on total cost of ownership, SLAs, and exit clauses, not just unit price. |
| Cross-team resource allocation | Use data on team capacity and project impact to make your case. Propose pilot programs to reduce perceived risk. |
| Equity and role in a startup | Understand vesting schedules, cliff periods, and dilution. Negotiate for accelerated vesting on acquisition if applicable. |

## Overcoming obstacles

Negotiations frequently stall or become tense. How you handle these moments determines whether you reach agreement or deadlock.

- **When emotions rise**: Pause the conversation. Acknowledge the tension without assigning blame. Say something like "Let's take a step back and revisit what we are both trying to achieve."
- **When you hit an impasse**: Reframe the problem. Introduce new variables or options that were not previously considered. Ask "What would need to be true for this to work for you?"
- **When the other party uses pressure tactics**: Name the tactic calmly. "It seems like there is an artificial deadline here. Can we discuss why that date is important?" This defuses the tactic without creating hostility.
- **When you lack authority**: Be transparent. "I need to discuss this with my team before committing. Can we reconvene on Thursday?" Never agree to terms you cannot deliver.

## Closing the agreement

Reaching a verbal agreement is not the finish line. The final phase of negotiation requires careful documentation and verification.

- Summarize the agreed terms in writing immediately. Email a recap within 24 hours.
- Ensure both parties have the same understanding of every term. Ambiguity in agreements leads to conflict later.
- Identify next steps, owners, and deadlines for implementation.
- Seek legal or managerial review where appropriate before signing.
- Express appreciation. A negotiation that ends with both parties feeling respected builds the relationship for future interactions.

## Mistakes to avoid

- **Failing to prepare**: The most common and most costly error. Preparation is where negotiations are won.
- **Focusing only on price**: Compensation, contracts, and deals have many dimensions. Negotiating on a single axis leaves value on the table.
- **Accepting the first offer**: First offers are rarely final offers. A respectful counter-proposal is expected in most professional contexts.
- **Making it personal**: Attack the problem, never the person. Personal attacks destroy trust and guarantee a worse outcome.
- **Neglecting your BATNA**: Without a credible alternative, you have no leverage. Develop your BATNA before you begin.

## Summary

Negotiation is a learnable, practicable skill built on preparation, empathy, and strategic thinking. The strongest negotiators in technology are not the most aggressive; they are the most prepared, the most curious about the other party's needs, and the most creative in finding solutions that serve both sides. By defining your goals, researching thoroughly, building trust, bargaining on interests rather than positions, and documenting agreements carefully, you will consistently achieve better outcomes in compensation discussions, project planning, vendor contracts, and every other professional context where interests must be aligned.
