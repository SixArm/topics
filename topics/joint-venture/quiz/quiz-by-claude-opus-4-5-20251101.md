  <p>Participants contribute resources and share risks, rewards, and control in a newly formed entity</p>
  <p>A joint venture is specifically characterized by two or more independent entities coming together to form a new entity or partnership where they contribute resources, expertise, and capital while sharing ownership, risks, and rewards proportionally. Unlike mergers, JVs maintain the independence of parent companies while collaborating on specific objectives, and unlike advisory relationships, all parties actively participate in ownership and control.</p>
