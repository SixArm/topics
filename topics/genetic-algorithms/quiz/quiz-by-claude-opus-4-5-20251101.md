# Genetic algorithms

Question: In a genetic algorithm, what is the primary purpose of the mutation operator?

- [ ] To select the fittest chromosomes for reproduction
- [ ] To evaluate how well each solution solves the problem
- [ ] To combine parent chromosomes to create offspring
- [ ] To introduce diversity and prevent premature convergence

  <p>To introduce diversity and prevent premature convergence</p>
  <p>The mutation operator applies small, random changes to individual chromosomes. This introduces genetic diversity into the population, which helps the algorithm explore a broader solution space and prevents the population from converging too quickly on a suboptimal solution. Without mutation, the algorithm might get stuck in local optima.</p>
