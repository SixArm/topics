  <p>To define the structure and content of web pages</p>
  <p>HTML is a declarative markup language that describes the structure and content of a document, rather than specifying how it should be displayed or behave. It uses tags, attributes, and elements to organize content such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Visual styling is handled by CSS, dynamic behavior by JavaScript, and server-side processing by backend technologies.</p>
