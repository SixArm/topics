  <p>To determine whether a user has permission to access a resource or perform an action</p>
  <p>Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or system has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a particular action. This is distinct from authentication (verifying identity), encryption (protecting data confidentiality), or malware detection (security threat prevention). Authorization works alongside authentication—after verifying who you are, authorization determines what you're allowed to do.</p>
