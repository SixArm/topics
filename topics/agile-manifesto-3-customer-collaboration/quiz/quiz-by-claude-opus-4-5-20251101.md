  <p>Prioritizing ongoing dialogue and mutual trust over rigid contractual specifications</p>
  <p>This principle acknowledges that software requirements naturally evolve as stakeholders gain deeper insights into user needs and technical possibilities. Rather than eliminating contracts entirely, it emphasizes that productive customer relationships should transcend contractual boundaries, creating environments where customers feel comfortable providing honest feedback and participating actively in product decisions. The goal is collaboration and shared understanding, not the absence of agreements.</p>
