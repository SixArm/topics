# Agile manifesto 3: Customer collaboration

"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"

This point reshapes how software development teams approach client relationships. Traditional contract-heavy approaches often create adversarial dynamics between development teams and customers, where rigid specifications and change requests become sources of conflict rather than opportunities for improvement.

Customer collaboration prioritizes ongoing dialogue, shared understanding, and mutual trust throughout the development process. Instead of relying solely on detailed contracts that attempt to predict every requirement upfront, agile teams work closely with customers to continuously refine and adapt the product based on evolving needs and market conditions. This collaborative approach acknowledges that software requirements naturally evolve as stakeholders gain deeper insights into user needs and technical possibilities.

The value statement doesn't advocate for eliminating contracts entirely, but rather emphasizes that productive customer relationships should transcend contractual boundaries. When teams focus on collaboration, they create environments where customers feel comfortable providing honest feedback, sharing concerns, and participating actively in product decisions. This leads to better outcomes for both parties, as the final product more accurately reflects actual user needs rather than initial assumptions.

Successful implementation of this value requires establishing regular communication channels, involving customers in sprint reviews and planning sessions, and creating flexible agreements that accommodate change. Teams must foster transparency about progress, challenges, and trade-offs while maintaining clear expectations about scope and deliverables. By prioritizing collaboration over negotiation, agile teams build stronger partnerships that ultimately result in higher-quality software that delivers genuine value to end users and stakeholders alike.
