# Agile Manifesto Value 3 - Customer Collaboration: Tutorial

## Overview

"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation" is the third value statement of the Agile Manifesto. It advocates for ongoing, collaborative relationships with customers throughout the development process, rather than relying solely on formal contracts and fixed specifications to define the relationship.

## The Problem This Value Addresses

In traditional software development, the customer relationship often followed a transactional pattern:

1. The customer defines requirements in a detailed specification
2. Both parties negotiate and sign a contract based on those requirements
3. The development team builds exactly what was specified
4. The customer accepts or rejects the deliverable based on the contract

This approach creates several problems:

- **Adversarial dynamics**: When requirements change, both sides argue about whether the change is "in scope" or "out of scope"
- **Late discovery of misunderstandings**: The customer does not see the product until late in the process, when misalignments are expensive to fix
- **Optimizing for the contract, not the product**: Teams focus on meeting contractual obligations rather than delivering what the customer actually needs
- **Frozen requirements**: The contract incentivizes locking down requirements early, when understanding is at its lowest

## What Customer Collaboration Looks Like

### Continuous Involvement

The customer or their representative is actively involved throughout development—not just at the beginning (requirements) and end (acceptance). This includes:

- Participating in sprint planning to clarify priorities
- Attending sprint reviews to provide feedback on working software
- Being available for questions and clarifications during development
- Helping the team understand the business context behind requirements

### Shared Ownership of Outcomes

Instead of a handoff model where the development team delivers and the customer accepts or rejects, both parties share responsibility for the product's success. The customer brings domain knowledge and business priorities. The development team brings technical expertise and delivery capability.

### Flexible Scope

The specific features and details of the product are expected to evolve as both parties learn more. The customer can change priorities, add new requirements, and remove features that are no longer needed without triggering a contract dispute.

### Honest Communication

Both parties communicate openly about progress, risks, challenges, and trade-offs. The development team does not hide problems, and the customer does not hide changing priorities.

## The Role of Contracts

This value does not eliminate the need for contracts. Contracts remain important for:

- Establishing the commercial terms of the relationship
- Defining high-level scope and expectations
- Providing legal protection for both parties
- Setting boundaries around budget and timeline

The shift is in how contracts are structured. Agile-friendly contracts tend to:

- Define outcomes rather than detailed specifications
- Allow for scope flexibility within agreed boundaries
- Include provisions for regular check-ins and course corrections
- Focus on time-and-materials or capacity-based models rather than fixed-price, fixed-scope agreements

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Embed the customer in the team**: If possible, have a customer representative (product owner) working directly with the development team on a daily basis.
2. **Establish regular review cadences**: Hold sprint reviews or demos every one to two weeks where the customer sees working software and provides feedback.
3. **Create a shared backlog**: Maintain a single, visible product backlog that both the customer and the development team can see and discuss.
4. **Build trust incrementally**: Start with a small engagement to demonstrate value and build confidence before committing to larger scope.
5. **Negotiate agile-friendly contracts**: Work with legal teams to craft agreements that support flexibility and collaboration rather than rigid deliverables.

## Common Pitfalls

- **No customer involvement**: Claiming to be agile while the customer is absent from sprint reviews and planning sessions
- **Proxy customers**: Having someone who does not have decision-making authority represent the customer, leading to delayed decisions and rework
- **Scope creep without boundaries**: Using "collaboration" as an excuse for unlimited scope changes without discussing trade-offs in budget or timeline
- **One-way collaboration**: Expecting the customer to be available on demand without reciprocating with transparency and responsiveness

## Key Takeaway

Building the right product requires ongoing dialogue with the people who will use it and pay for it. Contracts provide a necessary framework, but the relationship between the development team and the customer should be defined by collaboration and shared purpose, not by adversarial negotiation over specifications.
