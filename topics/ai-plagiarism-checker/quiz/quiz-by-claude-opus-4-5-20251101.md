  <p>To highlight similar sections and provide links to the original sources</p>
  <p>The originality report generated by an AI plagiarism checker identifies and highlights text sections that appear similar to existing sources, and provides links to those original sources. This allows users to review the flagged content and determine whether revisions or proper citations are needed, rather than making automatic corrections or blocking publication.</p>
