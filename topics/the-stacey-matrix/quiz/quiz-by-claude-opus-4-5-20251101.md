  <p>Level of certainty about requirements and level of agreement among stakeholders</p>
  <p>The Stacey Matrix is a strategic decision-making framework that helps teams navigate complex projects by categorizing them based on these two dimensions. This creates four zones (Simple, Complicated, Complex, and Chaos) that guide teams in selecting appropriate management approaches and practices based on how well requirements are understood and how much stakeholders agree on the direction.</p>
