# Data Structure-Oriented Design

Question: What is the primary starting point when using Data Structure-Oriented Design (DSD) for software development?

- [ ] Writing unit tests that define expected system behavior
- [ ] Designing the user interface and user experience flows
- [ ] Defining the data structures that will represent the data
- [ ] Identifying the external APIs the system will integrate with

  <p>Defining the data structures that will represent the data</p>
  <p>In Data Structure-Oriented Design, the design process begins with the definition of the data structures that will be used to represent the data. The designer then identifies the operations needed on the data and designs algorithms to manipulate those structures. This data-first approach enables the creation of efficient, scalable software by carefully optimizing how data is stored and processed.</p>
