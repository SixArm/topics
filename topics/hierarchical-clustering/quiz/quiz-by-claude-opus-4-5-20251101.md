# Hierarchical clustering

Question: What is the key distinguishing feature of hierarchical clustering compared to other clustering algorithms like k-means?

- [ ] It requires specifying the number of clusters beforehand
- [ ] It only works with categorical data
- [ ] It produces a dendrogram showing cluster relationships at multiple levels of granularity
- [ ] It can only be used for image segmentation tasks

  <p>It produces a dendrogram showing cluster relationships at multiple levels of granularity</p>
  <p>Hierarchical clustering creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) that shows how data points are grouped at different levels, from individual points up to a single cluster containing all data. This allows analysts to choose the appropriate level of granularity for their needs without having to prespecify the number of clusters, unlike algorithms such as k-means.</p>
