# Definition of Customer Value (DoCV)

Customer value in agile software engineering represents the measurable benefit or worth that software features, functionality, or solutions deliver to end users and stakeholders. It encompasses both tangible outcomes like increased efficiency, cost savings, or revenue generation, and intangible benefits such as improved user experience, enhanced satisfaction, or reduced frustration. Customer value serves as the primary driver for prioritization decisions throughout the development process.

In agile methodologies, customer value is continuously assessed and refined through direct collaboration with users, regular feedback loops, and iterative delivery cycles. Teams focus on delivering working software that addresses real customer needs rather than simply meeting technical specifications or predetermined requirements. This value-centric approach ensures that development efforts remain aligned with business objectives and user expectations.

The concept extends beyond individual features to encompass the overall user journey. Agile teams evaluate customer value through various metrics including adoption rates, task completion efficiency, customer satisfaction scores, and user key performance indicators. Value can be relative and contextual, varying based on user personas, market conditions, and organizational priorities.

Maximizing customer value requires balancing competing priorities, technical constraints, and resource limitations while maintaining focus on delivering the highest value features first.
