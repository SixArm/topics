  <p>The measurable benefit or worth that software delivers to end users and stakeholders</p>
  <p>Customer value encompasses both tangible outcomes (increased efficiency, cost savings, revenue generation) and intangible benefits (improved user experience, enhanced satisfaction, reduced frustration).
