  <p>There are no qualified U.S. workers available to fill the position</p>
  <p>U.S. immigration law requires employers to demonstrate that there are no qualified U.S. workers available to fill the position before they can sponsor a foreign national for a work visa. This labor market test helps protect domestic workers while still allowing employers to access global talent when needed.</p>
