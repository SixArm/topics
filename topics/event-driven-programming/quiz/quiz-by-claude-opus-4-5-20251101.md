  <p>Event loop</p>
  <p>In event-driven programming, the application contains an event loop that waits for events to occur. When an event occurs, the event loop dispatches it to the appropriate event handler function for processing. This mechanism is fundamental to the event-driven paradigm and enables applications to respond to user actions, system signals, and messages in real-time.</p>
