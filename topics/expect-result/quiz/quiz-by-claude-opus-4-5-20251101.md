# Expect result

Question: What is the primary risk of incorrectly defining expected results in automated testing?

- [ ] Slower test execution performance
- [ ] Increased storage requirements for test data
- [ ] False positives or false negatives that undermine testing reliability
- [ ] Incompatibility with modern automation frameworks

  <p>False positives or false negatives that undermine testing reliability</p>
  <p>Incorrectly defined expected results directly impact the effectiveness of automated testing by producing false positives (tests pass when they should fail) or false negatives (tests fail when they should pass). This undermines the entire testing process's reliability because teams cannot trust the test results to accurately reflect whether the software is functioning correctly.</p>
