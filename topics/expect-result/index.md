# Expect result

When you expect a result, this means the software should produce specific output when a specific test case is executed. These results serve as benchmarks against which actual test outputs are compared to determine whether the software is functioning correctly. They form the foundation of automated test validation and are essential for creating reliable, repeatable testing processes.

When developing automated tests, testers must carefully define expected results based on business requirements, functional specifications, and user stories. These expectations can include specific data values, system behaviors, user interface changes, database states, or performance metrics. For example, an expected result might be that a login form accepts valid credentials and redirects users to a dashboard, or that a calculation function returns a specific numerical value when given particular inputs.

The accuracy of expected results directly impacts the effectiveness of automated testing. Incorrectly defined expectations can lead to false positives or false negatives, undermining the testing process's reliability. Therefore, expected results must be thoroughly reviewed and validated against requirements before implementation.

Modern automation frameworks typically store expected results in various formats, including configuration files, test data sheets, or directly within test scripts. This allows for easy maintenance and updates as requirements evolve. The comparison between expected and actual results is usually performed automatically by the testing framework, which generates detailed reports highlighting any discrepancies.

Regular review and updating of expected results help maintain test accuracy and relevance as the software evolves, ultimately contributing to higher software quality and reduced defect rates in production environments.
