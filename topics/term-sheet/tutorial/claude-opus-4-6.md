# Term sheet

A term sheet is a non-binding document that outlines the key terms and conditions of a proposed investment deal between an investor and a company seeking funding. It serves as the foundation for negotiations and, once both parties reach agreement, becomes the blueprint for drafting a legally binding investment agreement. Term sheets are most commonly encountered during venture capital financings, but they also appear in mergers and acquisitions, real estate transactions, and partnership agreements. For technology professionals—whether founders raising capital, CTOs evaluating strategic investors, or engineers receiving equity—understanding the term sheet is essential to protecting your interests and making informed decisions about the future of your company.

## Purpose and Legal Status

A term sheet is not a contract in the traditional sense. Most of its provisions are non-binding, meaning neither party is legally obligated to complete the deal on those terms. However, certain clauses—typically confidentiality, exclusivity (no-shop), and governing law—are binding even if the deal falls through. The term sheet exists to align expectations before both sides invest significant time and legal expense in drafting definitive agreements. It reduces the risk of costly surprises during due diligence and final documentation.

## Key Components

The term sheet covers a wide range of deal terms. The following are the most critical components that technology professionals should understand:

### Valuation

Valuation determines what percentage of the company the investor will own after the investment. Two figures matter:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Pre-money valuation | The agreed-upon value of the company before the new investment is added |
| Post-money valuation | The pre-money valuation plus the amount of the new investment |

For example, if a company has a pre-money valuation of $8 million and receives $2 million in funding, the post-money valuation is $10 million, and the investor owns 20% of the company. The option pool—shares reserved for future employee equity grants—is often included in the pre-money valuation, which effectively dilutes existing shareholders rather than the new investor.

### Investment Amount and Structure

The term sheet specifies the total capital being invested and the form the investment takes. Common structures include:

- **Preferred equity**: The most common form in venture capital, granting investors preferential rights over common stockholders
- **Convertible note**: A short-term debt instrument that converts into equity at a future financing round, often with a discount or valuation cap
- **SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)**: Similar to a convertible note but without interest or a maturity date, commonly used in early-stage rounds
- **Debt financing**: Straight loans with defined repayment terms and interest rates

### Liquidation Preferences

Liquidation preferences determine the order in which investors and shareholders get paid in the event of a sale, merger, or dissolution of the company. This is one of the most consequential terms for founders and employees holding common stock.

| Type | How It Works |
|------|-------------|
| 1x non-participating preferred | Investor gets their money back first (1x their investment), then remaining proceeds are split among common shareholders. Investor may convert to common if that yields a higher return. |
| 1x participating preferred | Investor gets their money back first, then also participates pro rata in the remaining proceeds alongside common shareholders ("double dipping"). |
| Multiple liquidation preference (e.g., 2x, 3x) | Investor gets 2x or 3x their investment back before any proceeds flow to common shareholders. Heavily favors investors and is generally unfavorable to founders. |

### Anti-Dilution Protection

Anti-dilution provisions protect investors if the company raises future rounds at a lower valuation (a "down round"). The two main mechanisms are:

- **Full ratchet**: The investor's conversion price is adjusted downward to match the new, lower price per share. This is aggressive and significantly dilutes founders and employees.
- **Weighted average**: The conversion price is adjusted based on a formula that accounts for how many new shares are issued and at what price. This is more common and more balanced. It can be calculated on a broad-based or narrow-based basis, with broad-based being more founder-friendly.

### Board Composition and Governance

The term sheet typically specifies the composition of the board of directors after the investment. A common early-stage structure includes:

- One or two seats for founders or management
- One seat for the lead investor
- One independent seat agreed upon by both parties

Board control is a significant governance issue. Founders should pay close attention to whether the term sheet grants investors effective veto power over major decisions through board seats, protective provisions, or both.

### Protective Provisions

Protective provisions give investors veto rights over specific company actions, regardless of their board representation. Common protective provisions require investor consent for:

- Issuing new shares or creating new classes of stock
- Changing the company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws
- Declaring dividends or making distributions
- Selling the company or substantially all of its assets
- Incurring debt above a specified threshold
- Changing the size of the board

### Information Rights

Information rights define what financial and operational data the investor is entitled to receive. Typical provisions include quarterly and annual financial statements, annual budgets, and capitalization table updates. Investors may also negotiate inspection rights, allowing them to examine the company's books and records.

### Pro Rata Rights and Preemptive Rights

Pro rata rights (also called preemptive rights) give existing investors the right to participate in future funding rounds to maintain their ownership percentage. This is valuable to investors because it protects them from dilution in subsequent rounds. For founders, granting pro rata rights to too many investors can limit flexibility in structuring future financings.

### Vesting and Founder Restrictions

Term sheets frequently address founder equity vesting. Investors may require that founder shares be subject to a vesting schedule—typically four years with a one-year cliff—even if the founders have been working on the company for some time. This protects the company and investors if a founder departs early. Related restrictions may include non-compete and non-solicitation clauses.

### Exclusivity and Confidentiality

These are typically the only binding provisions in the term sheet:

- **No-shop clause (exclusivity)**: Prevents the company from soliciting or negotiating with other investors for a defined period, usually 30 to 60 days, giving the lead investor time to complete due diligence
- **Confidentiality**: Requires both parties to keep the terms of the negotiation private

## Common Pitfalls for Technology Professionals

Technology professionals should watch for several issues when reviewing a term sheet:

- **Overemphasis on valuation**: A high headline valuation can be misleading if it comes with aggressive liquidation preferences, heavy anti-dilution protection, or excessive investor control provisions. A lower valuation with cleaner terms may yield better outcomes for founders and employees.
- **Option pool manipulation**: Investors may insist on a large option pool carved out of the pre-money valuation, which effectively lowers the true pre-money valuation and increases investor ownership.
- **Cumulative dividends**: Some term sheets include provisions for cumulative dividends on preferred stock, which accrue over time and are paid out before common shareholders receive anything in a liquidity event.
- **Drag-along rights**: These provisions allow majority shareholders (often investors) to force minority shareholders to participate in a sale of the company, potentially on terms unfavorable to founders and employees.
- **Redemption rights**: These allow investors to demand the return of their investment after a specified period if no liquidity event has occurred, which can put severe financial pressure on the company.

## Negotiation Best Practices

- Engage experienced legal counsel before signing or even responding to a term sheet
- Prioritize economic terms (valuation, liquidation preferences, anti-dilution) and control terms (board seats, protective provisions) as the most impactful areas
- Benchmark proposed terms against market standards for your stage, geography, and industry
- Negotiate the option pool size based on a realistic hiring plan rather than accepting an arbitrary percentage
- Clarify all definitions, especially around what constitutes a "liquidation event" or "change of control"
- Understand the interplay between terms—a seemingly minor provision can have outsized effects when combined with others

Understanding venture capital fund mechanics and the investor's perspective will also strengthen your ability to negotiate effectively.

## Summary

A term sheet is the critical document that frames an investment negotiation, establishing the economic and governance terms that will shape the relationship between investors and the company. While non-binding in most of its provisions, it sets the trajectory for the final legal agreements and determines how value, control, and risk are distributed. Technology professionals must look beyond the headline valuation to carefully evaluate liquidation preferences, anti-dilution mechanisms, board composition, protective provisions, and other terms that directly affect founder and employee outcomes. Engaging qualified legal counsel and understanding market norms are essential steps in navigating term sheet negotiations successfully.
