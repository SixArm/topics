## Term Sheet: A Comprehensive Guide for Technology Professionals

A term sheet is a foundational document in startup financing that outlines the key terms and conditions of a potential investment deal between an investor and a company seeking funding. While non-binding, it serves as the blueprint for negotiations and ultimately forms the basis for legally binding investment agreements.

## What is a Term Sheet?

A term sheet is a concise document—typically 5-10 pages—that summarizes the principal terms of a proposed investment. It is usually prepared by the investor (venture capital firm, angel investor, or private equity fund) after initial due diligence and indicates serious interest in funding a company.

The term sheet serves three critical purposes:

- **Establishes negotiation framework**: Creates a starting point for deal discussions
- **Signals commitment**: Demonstrates the investor's genuine interest in proceeding
- **Saves resources**: Prevents both parties from investing in expensive legal documentation before agreeing on fundamentals

## Key Components of a Term Sheet

### Valuation Terms

Valuation determines what percentage of your company the investor will own in exchange for their capital.

| Term | Definition | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Pre-money valuation | Company value before investment | Higher pre-money = less dilution for founders |
| Post-money valuation | Company value after investment (pre-money + investment) | Determines investor ownership percentage |
| Price per share | Investment amount divided by shares issued | Sets benchmark for future rounds |
| Option pool | Reserved equity for future employees | Often negotiated to come from pre-money, diluting founders |

### Investment Structure

The term sheet specifies how capital will be provided and in what form:

- **Equity**: Direct purchase of preferred stock
- **Convertible notes**: Debt that converts to equity at a future financing event
- **SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)**: Y Combinator's streamlined convertible instrument
- **Convertible preferred stock**: Most common structure for VC investments

### Liquidation Preferences

Liquidation preferences determine the order and amount investors receive when the company is sold or liquidated.

| Type | Description | Founder Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1x Non-participating | Investor gets their money back OR converts to common stock | Most founder-friendly |
| 1x Participating | Investor gets their money back AND their pro-rata share of remaining proceeds | Less favorable to founders |
| 2x+ Participating | Investor gets 2x (or more) their investment back AND participates | Most investor-friendly |

### Anti-Dilution Protection

Anti-dilution provisions protect investors if the company raises future funding at a lower valuation (a "down round").

- **Full ratchet**: Investor's conversion price adjusts to match any lower future price—highly punitive to founders
- **Weighted average (broad-based)**: Conversion price adjusts based on a formula considering shares outstanding—industry standard and more balanced
- **Weighted average (narrow-based)**: Similar to broad-based but excludes certain shares from calculation—less favorable to founders

### Board Composition and Governance

| Element | Typical Structure |
|---------|------------------|
| Board seats | Investors typically request 1-2 seats proportional to ownership |
| Board observer rights | Non-voting attendance rights for smaller investors |
| Protective provisions | Veto rights over major decisions (sale, new fundraising, executive hiring) |
| Voting thresholds | Percentage required for specific corporate actions |

### Founder and Employee Terms

- **Vesting schedules**: Standard is 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff for founders with unvested shares
- **Acceleration**: Single or double trigger acceleration on change of control
- **Non-compete/non-solicit**: Restrictions on founders during and after employment
- **Key person provisions**: Conditions tied to specific individuals remaining with the company

### Information and Participation Rights

Investors typically negotiate for:

- Quarterly and annual financial statements
- Annual budgets and operating plans
- Attendance rights at board meetings
- Pro-rata rights to invest in future rounds
- Right of first refusal on secondary sales

## Economic vs. Control Terms

Understanding the distinction between economic and control terms is essential for negotiations.

| Economic Terms | Control Terms |
|----------------|---------------|
| Valuation | Board composition |
| Liquidation preference | Protective provisions |
| Anti-dilution provisions | Voting rights |
| Dividends | Information rights |
| Option pool size | Drag-along/tag-along rights |
| Participation rights | Founder vesting |

**Strategic insight**: Founders often focus heavily on valuation while investors may prioritize control terms. Both matter significantly for long-term outcomes.

## Red Flags to Watch For

When reviewing a term sheet, be cautious of:

- **Participating preferred with high multiples**: Can significantly reduce founder proceeds in moderate exits
- **Full ratchet anti-dilution**: Severely punishes founders in down rounds
- **Excessive protective provisions**: Too many veto rights can paralyze decision-making
- **Unrealistic option pool demands**: Large pre-money option pools dilute existing shareholders
- **Overly broad founder vesting resets**: Can put founders at risk of losing equity
- **Redemption rights**: Allow investors to force buyback of their shares
- **Cumulative dividends**: Compound over time and reduce founder proceeds at exit

## Negotiation Best Practices

**Before negotiating:**
- Research comparable deals in your sector and stage
- Understand your BATNA (best alternative to negotiated agreement)
- Prioritize which terms matter most to your situation
- Consult experienced legal counsel

**During negotiation:**
- Focus on the 3-5 terms that matter most
- Trade economic terms for control terms strategically
- Get multiple term sheets when possible to create leverage
- Maintain relationships—you'll work with these investors for years

**Key principle**: Not all terms are equally negotiable. Valuation and board composition are often flexible; standard protective provisions and information rights are typically non-negotiable.

## Timeline and Process

| Stage | Typical Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| Initial meetings to term sheet | 2-6 weeks |
| Term sheet negotiation | 1-2 weeks |
| Due diligence | 2-4 weeks |
| Legal documentation | 2-4 weeks |
| Closing | 1 week |

**Total**: 2-4 months from first meeting to funding

## Standard vs. Founder-Friendly Terms

| Term | Standard | Founder-Friendly |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Liquidation preference | 1x non-participating | 1x non-participating with cap |
| Anti-dilution | Weighted average (broad-based) | Weighted average with pay-to-play |
| Board composition | 2 founders, 1 investor, 2 independent | Founder majority |
| Protective provisions | Standard set | Narrowly defined |
| Founder vesting | 4 years, 1-year cliff | Credit for time served |

## Conclusion

A term sheet represents the critical juncture where investment terms are established. For technology professionals—whether founders, executives, or early employees—understanding these documents is essential for protecting your interests and building sustainable companies.

The most successful negotiations result from preparation, understanding investor motivations, and focusing on terms that genuinely matter for your company's specific situation. While valuation captures headlines, the control terms and downside protections often determine outcomes in realistic exit scenarios.
