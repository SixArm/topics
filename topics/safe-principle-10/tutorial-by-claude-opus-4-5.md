# Organize Around Value: Tutorial

## Overview

"Organize around value" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) Principle 10. This principle challenges the traditional organizational model -- built on functional expertise and departmental silos -- and advocates instead for structuring the enterprise around the flow of value to customers. In the digital age, the only sustainable competitive advantage is the speed with which an organization can respond to customer needs with innovative solutions. Organizing around value is how that speed is achieved.

This tutorial provides change technology professionals with a comprehensive understanding of value-based organizational design, its contrast with traditional structures, and practical strategies for leading this transformation.

## Key Concepts

### The Legacy of Functional Organization

Most enterprises today are still organized around principles developed during the industrial era. Teams are structured by functional specialty: separate departments for development, testing, operations, design, product management, security, and so on. This structure was designed for efficiency through specialization.

However, in software and technology organizations, functional silos create significant problems:

- **Dependencies and handoffs:** Work must pass between departments, each handoff introducing delay, information loss, and risk of misalignment.
- **Waste:** Queues form at departmental boundaries. People wait for other departments to complete their part.
- **Delayed feedback:** End-to-end cycle times are long because work moves sequentially through specialized groups.
- **Diffused accountability:** No single team is responsible for delivering customer value end-to-end.

### Value Streams

A value stream is the series of steps an organization uses to deliver a solution that provides a continuous flow of value to a customer. SAFe identifies two types:

- **Operational value streams:** The steps used to deliver a product or service to a customer. For example, the end-to-end process of fulfilling a customer order.
- **Development value streams:** The steps used to build the solutions that enable operational value streams. For example, the process of developing and deploying a new software feature.

Organizing around value means structuring teams, budgets, and management around these value streams rather than around functional departments.

### Agile Release Trains (ARTs)

In SAFe, the primary organizational construct for value delivery is the Agile Release Train (ART) -- a long-lived team of agile teams (typically 50-125 people) that plans, commits, develops, and deploys together. ARTs are cross-functional, containing all the skills needed to define, build, test, and deliver value.

ARTs are aligned to value streams, ensuring that each train is focused on delivering value to specific customers or market segments rather than performing a functional specialty.

### Business Agility Through Reorganization

SAFe recognizes that markets and customer demands change. When they do, the enterprise must be able to quickly and seamlessly reorganize around the new value flow. This means:

- Teams and ARTs can be reformed, redirected, or restructured with minimal disruption.
- People identify with their value contribution rather than their functional department.
- Budgets flow to value streams, not to projects, making reallocation faster and simpler.

### Cooperation Across Functions

Organizing around value does not mean eliminating functional expertise -- it means structuring the organization so that functional experts work together in cross-functional teams rather than in isolated departments. Communities of practice and Centers of Excellence can maintain and develop functional expertise while people do their daily work within cross-functional value stream teams.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Identify your value streams.** Map both your operational and development value streams. Understand how value flows from concept to customer, who is involved, and where handoffs and delays occur.

2. **Assess current organizational alignment.** Compare your current organizational structure to your value stream map. Identify where functional silos create handoffs, queues, and delays in value delivery.

3. **Form cross-functional Agile Release Trains.** Create long-lived teams of teams aligned to development value streams. Ensure each ART has all the skills needed to deliver value end-to-end: product management, design, development, testing, DevOps, and any other required disciplines.

4. **Shift budget allocation to value streams.** Move from project-based funding (which is temporary and requires re-justification) to value stream-based Lean budgets (which are persistent and adaptable). This reduces funding overhead and enables faster response to changing priorities.

5. **Establish cross-functional team norms.** When people from different functional backgrounds come together on value-aligned teams, they need new working agreements, shared goals, and collaborative practices. Invest in team formation and coaching.

6. **Create Communities of Practice.** To maintain and develop functional expertise, establish communities of practice where specialists across different value stream teams can share knowledge, set standards, and mentor each other.

7. **Align management to value streams.** Ensure that reporting lines, performance management, and leadership structures align with value streams. If developers report to a VP of Engineering who optimizes for engineering metrics rather than customer value, the organizational misalignment will persist.

8. **Prepare for reorganization.** Build organizational muscle for change. Practice restructuring teams and ARTs in response to changing market conditions. The goal is to make reorganization a routine activity, not a traumatic event.

9. **Measure value delivery, not functional output.** Track metrics that reflect end-to-end value delivery: customer satisfaction, lead time, business outcomes. Avoid metrics that reinforce functional silos, such as "lines of code written" or "test cases executed."

10. **Communicate the rationale for change.** Reorganizing around value is a significant change for people who identify with their functional departments. Communicate clearly why this change is necessary, how it benefits customers and the organization, and how individuals will continue to grow their expertise in the new structure.

## Key Takeaway

Organizing around value is the structural foundation for Business Agility. Traditional functional organizations optimize for departmental efficiency at the expense of end-to-end value delivery. In a world where competitive advantage depends on speed of response to customer needs, this trade-off is no longer acceptable. Change technology professionals must lead the transformation from functional silos to value stream-aligned organizations, creating cross-functional teams and ARTs that can deliver customer value end-to-end. This reorganization is not a one-time event but an ongoing capability -- the ability to sense market changes and reorganize quickly around new value flows is itself a competitive advantage. The goal is an organization where every team, budget, and decision is oriented toward delivering the most value to customers as quickly and sustainably as possible.
