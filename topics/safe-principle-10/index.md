# Organize around value

"Organize around value" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 10.

Many enterprises today are organized around principles developed during the last
century. In the name of intended efficiency, most are organized around
functional expertise. But in the digital age, the only sustainable competitive
advantage is the speed with which an organization can respond to the needs of
its customers with new and innovative solutions. These solutions require
cooperation amongst all the functional areas, with their incumbent dependencies,
handoffs, waste, and delays. Instead, Business Agility demands that enterprises
organize around value to deliver more quickly. And when market and customer
demands change, the enterprise must quickly and seamlessly reorganize around
that new value flow.
