  <p>To enable faster response to customer needs, which is the only sustainable competitive advantage in the digital age</p>
  <p>SAFe Principle 10 states that organizing around functional expertise creates dependencies, handoffs, waste, and delays. In the digital age, the only sustainable competitive advantage is the speed with which an organization can respond to customer needs with new and innovative solutions. Business Agility demands that enterprises organize around value to deliver more quickly and be able to seamlessly reorganize when market and customer demands change.</p>
