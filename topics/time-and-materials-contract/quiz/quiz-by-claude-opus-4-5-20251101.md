  <p>When the scope of work is difficult to define or flexibility is required</p>
  <p>A T&M contract is specifically designed for situations where the scope of work cannot be precisely defined upfront or when the buyer needs flexibility to make changes as the project progresses. Unlike fixed-price contracts, T&M allows buyers to adjust requirements during the project, which is particularly valuable for complex projects or those where actual costs are difficult to estimate in advance.</p>
