# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Question: What is the primary traversal strategy used by Depth-First Search (DFS)?

- [ ] Explores nodes level by level, visiting all neighbors before moving deeper
- [ ] Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- [ ] Randomly selects the next node to visit from all unvisited nodes
- [ ] Always visits the node with the smallest value first

  <p>Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking</p>
  <p>DFS starts at a selected node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This distinguishes it from Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores nodes level by level. DFS can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack data structure, and is commonly used for tasks like finding paths, cycle detection, topological sorting, and finding connected components.</p>
