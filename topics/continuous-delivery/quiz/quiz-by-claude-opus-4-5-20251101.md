  <p>To ensure software changes are released in a timely, predictable, and reliable manner</p>
  <p>Continuous Delivery is a software development approach that automates the entire software release process—including continuous integration, testing, and deployment—with the goal of releasing software changes in a timely, predictable, and reliable manner. This is achieved through a pipeline of stages (build, test, deploy, release) and requires high collaboration among development, testing, and operations teams.</p>
