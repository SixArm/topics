# Hyperparameter tuning

Question: What is the primary purpose of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning?

- [ ] To learn parameters directly from the training data during model fitting
- [ ] To find the optimal set of hyperparameters that maximize model performance
- [ ] To reduce the size of the training dataset for faster processing
- [ ] To convert categorical variables into numerical representations

  <p>To find the optimal set of hyperparameters that maximize model performance</p>
  <p>Hyperparameter tuning (also called hyperparameter optimization) is the process of systematically searching for the best combination of hyperparameters—settings that are defined before training begins and cannot be learned from the data directly. By evaluating different hyperparameter configurations using validation data and performance metrics, practitioners can identify the optimal settings that yield the best model performance and generalization ability.</p>
