  <p>Bottom-Up Estimating</p>
  <p>Bottom-Up Estimating breaks down the project into smaller tasks or work packages, estimates the effort and resources required for each individual component, then rolls up the estimates to obtain an overall project estimate. This technique provides high accuracy because it accounts for the specific details of each task, making it particularly valuable for complex projects where detailed planning is essential.</p>
