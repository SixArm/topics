  <p>It helps teams understand how changes in one area can affect the broader system and anticipate consequences</p>
  <p>Systems thinking brings a holistic perspective to agile practices by emphasizing the relationships between components, stakeholders, and processes. Rather than viewing software development as isolated tasks, this approach considers dynamic interactions across the entire ecosystem, helping teams anticipate how modifications might ripple throughout the system and design solutions that strengthen rather than fragment the whole.</p>
