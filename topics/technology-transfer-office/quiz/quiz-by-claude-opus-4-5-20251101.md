  <p>To ensure discoveries and inventions are used for the benefit of society</p>
  <p>A Technology Transfer Office's primary goal is to ensure that discoveries and inventions arising from an institution's research activities are used for the benefit of society. While TTOs engage in patenting, licensing, startup support, and marketing, these are all functions that serve this broader societal benefit mission rather than being ends in themselves.</p>
