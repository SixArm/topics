  <p>They deliberately introduce failures to test system resilience and learn through experimentation</p>
  <p>Netflix's "chaos engineering" approach, including tools like Chaos Monkey, deliberately introduces failures into their production systems to test resilience. This embodies the agile principle of learning through experimentation and helps ensure their microservices architecture can handle real-world failures gracefully, supporting their ability to deploy thousands of changes per day.</p>
