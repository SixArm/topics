  <p>Manpower, Methods, Machines, Materials, Measurements, Mother nature</p>
  <p>The cause-and-effect diagram (also called Ishikawa or fishbone diagram) uses six standard categories known as the "6 Ms" to organize potential causes: Manpower (people), Methods (processes), Machines (equipment), Materials (inputs), Measurements (data), and Mother nature (environmental conditions). These categories provide a structured framework for brainstorming and help ensure comprehensive root cause analysis.</p>
