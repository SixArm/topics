Question: According to SAFe Principle 2, what is the key insight about optimizing individual components within a system?

- [ ] Optimizing each component separately leads to overall system efficiency
- [ ] Component optimization should always take priority over system-level concerns
- [ ] Optimizing a component does not optimize the system
- [ ] Individual components operate independently and can be improved in isolation

  <p>Optimizing a component does not optimize the system</p>
  <p>Deming observed that systems are complex with many interrelated components, and optimizing individual components does not optimize the overall system. To improve, everyone must understand the larger aim of the system. This principle applies both to the system under development and to the organization that builds it.</p>
