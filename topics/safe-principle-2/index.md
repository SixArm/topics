# Apply systems thinking

"Apply systems thinking" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 2.

Deming observed that addressing the challenges in the workplace and the
marketplace requires an understanding of the systems within which workers and
users operate . Such systems are complex, and they consist of many interrelated
components. But optimizing a component does not optimize the system. To improve,
everyone must understand the larger aim of the system. In SAFe, systems thinking
is applied to the system under development, as well as to the organization that
builds the system.
