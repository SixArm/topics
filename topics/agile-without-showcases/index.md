# Agile without showcases

Agile methodology traditionally emphasizes regular demonstrations of working software through showcases, but some teams are exploring alternative approaches that move away from formal presentation formats. This shift often stems from concerns about showcase fatigue, time constraints, or the artificial nature of preparing demonstrations that may not reflect genuine user experiences.

The absence of showcases places greater emphasis on other communication channels. Teams rely more heavily on collaborative tools, informal check-ins, and embedded feedback mechanisms within the software itself. Product owners and stakeholders must become more proactive in testing and reviewing work as it progresses, rather than waiting for formal review sessions.

Continuous integration and deployment practices become even more critical, allowing stakeholders to interact with features in real-time rather than waiting for scheduled demonstrations. This approach can create more authentic feedback loops, as users engage with functionality in their natural work environment rather than in a controlled presentation setting.

However, this approach risks losing the collaborative energy and shared understanding that showcases typically provide. The ceremony of gathering stakeholders together creates opportunities for cross-functional discussion and alignment that might otherwise be missed. Teams choosing this path must be particularly deliberate about providing strong communication practices, creating alternative forums for stakeholder engagement and team celebration, and high levels of trust.
