# Agile without showcases

Question: What becomes more critical when teams eliminate formal showcases from their Agile process?

- [ ] Reducing stakeholder involvement to minimize feedback overhead
- [ ] Scheduling longer sprint planning meetings to compensate
- [ ] Continuous integration and deployment practices that allow stakeholders to interact with features in real-time
- [ ] Documenting all requirements upfront before development begins

  <p>Continuous integration and deployment practices that allow stakeholders to interact with features in real-time</p>
  <p>When teams move away from formal showcases, CI/CD practices become even more critical because they allow stakeholders to interact with features in their natural work environment as development progresses. This creates more authentic feedback loops compared to controlled presentation settings, and compensates for the loss of scheduled demonstration sessions.</p>
