  <p>The few essential areas where a business must excel to achieve its mission and goals</p>
  <p>Critical Success Factors are derived from a company's goals, objectives, and mission. They represent the key performance areas that must be monitored and managed to achieve desired results. Unlike comprehensive task lists or standard procedures, CSFs focus specifically on the vital areas that determine organizational success or failure, such as customer satisfaction, quality, innovation, employee well-being, cost efficiency, or brand reputation.</p>
