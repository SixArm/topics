  <p>Red, Green, Refactor</p>
  <p>The TDD cycle follows a specific order: First, write a failing test (Red), then write the minimum code to make the test pass (Green), and finally improve the code quality through refactoring (Refactor). This sequence ensures that tests drive the design, code is always tested, and code quality is continuously improved.</p>
