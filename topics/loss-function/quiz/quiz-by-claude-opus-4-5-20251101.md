# Loss Function

Question: What is the primary purpose of a loss function in machine learning?

- [ ] To visualize the decision boundary of a classifier
- [ ] To quantify the discrepancy between predicted outputs and actual target values, guiding model optimization
- [ ] To increase the number of parameters in a neural network
- [ ] To split data into training and test sets

  <p>To quantify the discrepancy between predicted outputs and actual target values, guiding model optimization</p>
  <p>A loss function measures how far the model's predictions are from the actual ground truth values. This quantified error guides optimization algorithms like gradient descent to iteratively adjust the model's parameters, continuing until further updates no longer significantly reduce the loss.</p>
