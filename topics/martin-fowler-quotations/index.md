# Martin Fowler quotations

"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." Clear, expressive code helps future developers and reduces the cognitive burden of understanding complex systems.

"If you're afraid to change something it is clearly poorly designed." Fowler advocates for creating software architectures that embrace change rather than resist it. Well-designed systems should be flexible and modifiable, allowing teams to adapt quickly to evolving requirements without fear of breaking existing functionality.

"Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior." This continuously improves code quality through small, incremental changes that maintain functionality while enhancing design and readability.

"The most important aspect of software development is communication." Fowler recognizes that software engineering is fundamentally a collaborative human endeavor. Effective communication between team members, stakeholders, and users is essential for building software that truly meets needs and expectations.

"You can't have a methodology that is divorced from the people who are going to use it." This insight reflects Fowler's understanding that successful software development processes must be tailored to the specific context, skills, and culture of the team implementing them.

"Continuous integration doesn't get rid of bugs, but it does make them dramatically easier to find and remove." Fowler promoted practices that enable early detection of problems, allowing teams to address issues when they're still small and manageable rather than letting them compound into larger, more expensive problems.
