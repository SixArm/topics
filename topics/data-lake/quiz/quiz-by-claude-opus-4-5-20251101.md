  <p>Data lakes store data in its native format without upfront processing or transformation</p>
  <p>Unlike traditional data warehouses that require data to conform to a predefined schema before loading (schema-on-write), data lakes allow raw, unstructured, and structured data to be ingested in its native format. This schema-on-read approach enables businesses to quickly store data from various sources and analyze it later without worrying about upfront data quality or schema requirements.</p>
