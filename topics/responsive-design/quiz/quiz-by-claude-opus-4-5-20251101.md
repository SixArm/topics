  <p>CSS media queries</p>
  <p>Responsive design is achieved through the use of flexible and fluid layout grids, and by using CSS media queries to adjust the layout and style of the website or application based on the size and orientation of the screen. Media queries allow developers to apply different CSS rules depending on device characteristics, enabling a single codebase to adapt to any screen size.</p>
