# Flat design

Question: What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes flat design from skeuomorphic design?

- [ ] Heavy use of shadows, gradients, and textures to simulate real-world materials
- [ ] Focus on three-dimensional visual effects and realistic depth perception
- [ ] Minimalism with two-dimensional elements, eliminating shadows, gradients, and textures
- [ ] Complex decorative embellishments to enhance visual richness

  <p>Minimalism with two-dimensional elements, eliminating shadows, gradients, and textures</p>
  <p>Flat design emerged as a response to skeuomorphic design by embracing minimalism and removing unnecessary visual complexity. Unlike skeuomorphic design which uses shadows, gradients, and textures to simulate real-world materials and depth, flat design favors simple shapes, bold colors, and clean two-dimensional visuals to create clarity and simplicity in user interfaces.</p>
