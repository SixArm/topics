  <p>How software components are deployed on hardware infrastructure and how they interact</p>
  <p>A deployment diagram shows the configuration and arrangement of runtime processing nodes, components, and artifacts in a distributed system. It depicts the physical architecture of a system, illustrating the relationship between hardware nodes (such as servers or workstations) and software components (such as web applications or databases), along with the connections between them.</p>
