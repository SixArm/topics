  <p>Generating a large quantity of ideas without immediate judgment</p>
  <p>During ideation, the emphasis is on divergent thinking and quantity over quality. The goal is to create a free-flowing environment that encourages diverse thinking and the emergence of innovative ideas. Judgment and evaluation are suspended during this phase to allow exploration of a wide range of perspectives and potential solutions. Evaluation and refinement come in a subsequent phase.</p>
