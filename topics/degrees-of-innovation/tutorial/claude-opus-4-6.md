# Degrees of innovation

Innovation is not a monolithic concept. It spans a spectrum of magnitude, from small refinements to paradigm-shifting breakthroughs. Understanding the degrees of innovation helps technology professionals classify their work, set appropriate expectations for risk and reward, calibrate investment strategies, and communicate effectively with stakeholders. The three widely recognized degrees are incremental innovation, breakthrough innovation, and radical innovation. Each carries distinct characteristics regarding scope, risk, timeline, and organizational impact.

## The Three Degrees

The innovation spectrum is typically divided into three tiers based on the magnitude of change introduced.

**Incremental innovation** refers to small improvements or enhancements made to existing products, services, processes, or systems. It involves making iterative changes, refining existing features, or optimizing performance. Incremental innovations are typically aimed at increasing efficiency, reducing costs, improving user experience, or addressing minor issues. While incremental innovations are not disruptive, they contribute to the continuous improvement and evolution of existing offerings.

**Breakthrough innovation** involves significant advancements or disruptions within a particular industry or domain. It goes beyond incremental improvements and introduces novel approaches, features, or functionalities that create substantial value or address unmet needs. Breakthrough innovations represent a leap forward, challenging existing norms and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. They have the potential to disrupt markets, create new business models, or revolutionize industries.

**Radical innovation** represents a complete departure from existing practices, products, or technologies. It involves introducing entirely new concepts, ideas, or paradigms that fundamentally change the way things are done. Radical innovations often disrupt entire industries, displacing existing solutions or creating entirely new markets. They require significant shifts in thinking, entail high risks, and have the potential for significant rewards. Examples include the introduction of personal computers, the advent of the internet, and the emergence of blockchain technology.

## Comparison of Degrees

| Dimension | Incremental | Breakthrough | Radical |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scope of change** | Refinement of existing offerings | Major advancement within a domain | Complete paradigm shift |
| **Risk level** | Low | Moderate to high | Very high |
| **Time horizon** | Short-term (weeks to months) | Medium-term (months to years) | Long-term (years to decades) |
| **Investment required** | Modest | Significant | Substantial, often uncertain |
| **Market impact** | Sustains current market position | Disrupts segments of a market | Creates or destroys entire markets |
| **Knowledge base** | Builds on existing knowledge | Extends and recombines knowledge | Requires fundamentally new knowledge |
| **Failure tolerance** | Low tolerance needed | Moderate tolerance needed | High tolerance essential |
| **Example** | Annual smartphone camera improvements | Touchscreen replacing physical keyboards | The invention of the internet |

## When to Pursue Each Degree

Choosing the right degree of innovation depends on organizational context, market conditions, and strategic objectives.

- **Pursue incremental innovation** when the market is mature, customers are satisfied with the core product, and the goal is to maintain competitive parity or improve margins. Most of an organization's innovation portfolio should be incremental because it delivers reliable, compounding returns.
- **Pursue breakthrough innovation** when market signals indicate unmet customer needs, emerging technologies enable new possibilities, or competitors are beginning to shift the landscape. This degree requires dedicated teams, longer funding cycles, and executive sponsorship.
- **Pursue radical innovation** when an organization has the appetite for high-risk, high-reward bets and the patience to sustain long development timelines. Radical innovation often emerges from research labs, skunkworks teams, or startup ecosystems rather than from mainline product groups.

## The Innovation Portfolio

Technology leaders benefit from maintaining a balanced portfolio across all three degrees. A common allocation model is the 70-20-10 rule:

- **70% of resources** directed toward incremental innovation, ensuring the core business remains competitive and efficient.
- **20% of resources** directed toward breakthrough innovation, exploring adjacent opportunities and next-generation capabilities.
- **10% of resources** directed toward radical innovation, placing strategic bets on transformational ideas that could redefine the business.

This distribution acknowledges that most value in the near term comes from incremental work, while long-term survival often depends on breakthrough and radical efforts. The exact ratios should be adjusted based on industry dynamics, organizational maturity, and competitive pressure.

## Organizational Implications

Each degree of innovation places different demands on organizational structure, culture, and processes.

- **Incremental innovation** fits well within existing teams and standard development workflows. Agile methodologies, continuous integration, and iterative release cycles are natural enablers.
- **Breakthrough innovation** often requires cross-functional teams with dedicated mandates, shielded from the pressures of day-to-day operations. Design thinking, rapid prototyping, and customer co-creation are effective approaches.
- **Radical innovation** demands a high tolerance for ambiguity, failure, and long feedback loops. Organizations may need to create separate entities, partner with research institutions, or acquire startups to access the talent and mindset required.

A critical leadership challenge is protecting breakthrough and radical initiatives from being starved of resources by the more predictable incremental projects that dominate short-term metrics.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-indexing on incremental innovation.** Organizations that focus exclusively on small improvements risk being blindsided by competitors or new entrants who pursue higher-order innovation.
- **Mislabeling the degree.** Calling an incremental improvement a breakthrough erodes credibility and sets unrealistic expectations. Honest classification enables better planning.
- **Applying the wrong process.** Using rigid, milestone-driven project management for radical innovation stifles creativity. Conversely, using open-ended exploration for incremental work wastes resources.
- **Ignoring the transition path.** Breakthrough and radical innovations must eventually be operationalized. Without a clear path from prototype to production, even the most promising ideas stall.

## Summary

Degrees of innovation provide a practical taxonomy for classifying the magnitude of change an innovation introduces. Incremental innovation refines what exists, breakthrough innovation advances what is possible, and radical innovation redefines what is imaginable. Technology professionals who understand these distinctions can make better decisions about resource allocation, risk management, team structure, and strategic planning. A balanced innovation portfolio that spans all three degrees positions an organization to compete effectively today while preparing for the disruptions of tomorrow.
