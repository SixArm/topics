# Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)

Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is the world's most widely used framework for IT Service Management (ITSM). It provides a set of best practices for aligning IT services with the needs of a business, ensuring that technology supports its core goals.

The Four Dimensions: To ensure a holistic approach, ITIL 4 considers four key areas for every service:

- Organizations and People: Roles, responsibilities, and culture.
- Information and Technology: The tools and data required.
- Partners and Suppliers: External relationships.
- Value Streams and Processes: How activities coordinate to create value.

Versions:

- ITIL 3 (The Service Lifecycle): Organized around five stages: Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Transition, Service Operation, and Continual Service Improvement.
- ITIL 4 (The Service Value System): Focuses on the Service Value System (SVS) and the Service Value Chain, integrating modern practices like Agile, DevOps, and Lean.
