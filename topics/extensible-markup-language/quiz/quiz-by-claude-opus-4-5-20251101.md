  <p>To store and transport data in a structured, shareable format</p>
  <p>XML is designed to store and transport data, not to display it. Unlike HTML, which focuses on presentation, XML describes and structures data using a tree-like hierarchy of tags and attributes, making it easy to share and exchange between different applications, platforms, and programming languages.</p>
