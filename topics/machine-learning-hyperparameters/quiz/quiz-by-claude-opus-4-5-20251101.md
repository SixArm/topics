# Machine learning hyperparameters

Question: What distinguishes hyperparameters from a model's learned parameters (such as weights)?

- [ ] Hyperparameters are always numeric values while learned parameters can be categorical
- [ ] Hyperparameters are set before training begins and are not learned from the data
- [ ] Hyperparameters are optimized using backpropagation during training
- [ ] Hyperparameters are automatically determined by the size of the dataset

  <p>Hyperparameters are set before training begins and are not learned from the data</p>
  <p>Hyperparameters control various aspects of the training procedure and must be configured by the user or determined through a search process (such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization) before the learning process starts. In contrast, model parameters like weights are learned directly from the training data during the optimization process. Understanding this distinction is fundamental because it determines how you approach model configuration versus model training.</p>
