  <p>Authentication verifies identity, Authorization grants permissions, Accounting tracks usage, Auditing reviews logs for compliance</p>
  <p>The AAAA framework follows a logical security flow: Authentication first confirms who a user is through credentials like passwords or biometrics. Authorization then determines what resources that verified user can access based on their privileges. Accounting tracks and records what the user does with those resources, including time spent and actions performed. Finally, Auditing regularly reviews these activity logs to ensure compliance with security policies and detect potential breaches.</p>
