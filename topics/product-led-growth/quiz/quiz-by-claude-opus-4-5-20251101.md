  <p>The product itself through user adoption, satisfaction, and word-of-mouth referrals</p>
  <p>PLG is a business strategy that puts the product at the center of customer acquisition and retention. Instead of relying on traditional marketing and sales tactics, PLG creates a product so compelling that it "sells itself" and drives growth through user adoption, satisfaction, and word-of-mouth referrals. Companies like Slack, Zoom, and Dropbox have achieved rapid growth using this product-first approach.</p>
