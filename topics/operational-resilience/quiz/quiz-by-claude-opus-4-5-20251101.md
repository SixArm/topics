  <p>To continue operating even in the face of unexpected disruptions or failures</p>
  <p>Operational resilience is fundamentally about an organization's ability to maintain operations during disruptions, recover from them, and adapt to changing circumstances. This includes creating contingency plans, establishing redundant systems, and cultivating a culture of resilience. It's especially critical in industries like financial services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure where even brief disruptions can have serious consequences.</p>
