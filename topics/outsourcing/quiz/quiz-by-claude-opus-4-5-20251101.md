  <p>Data security breaches and intellectual property theft</p>
  <p>While outsourcing offers benefits like cost savings and access to expertise, a major risk is that outsourcing providers may not have the same level of security measures as in-house teams. This can leave businesses vulnerable to data breaches, intellectual property theft, and other security risks—making security due diligence essential when selecting outsourcing partners.</p>
