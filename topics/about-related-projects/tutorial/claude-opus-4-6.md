# About related projects

Related projects are companion open source repositories that cover startup strategy, tactics, and tools. These resources collectively form an interconnected knowledge base for technology professionals working in product development, software architecture, team management, and business strategy. Each project is a free libre open source git repository that provides focused, practical guidance on a specific topic. Understanding how these projects relate to one another helps professionals build a holistic view of the disciplines that drive successful technology organizations.

## Why related projects matter

Technology work does not happen in isolation. A software architect making an architecture decision record needs to understand key performance indicators to measure success. A product manager building a pitch deck needs a business model canvas to ground their strategy. A team lead establishing ways of working benefits from knowledge of crucial conversations and company culture. Related projects serve as a web of interconnected references, allowing professionals to follow threads from one domain into adjacent ones, deepening expertise across disciplines.

## Architecture and engineering projects

These projects support the technical foundation of software and systems work:

- **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** captures the reasoning behind significant architectural choices, providing a historical record that helps teams understand why systems were built a particular way.
- **Decision Record (DR) template** offers a generalized format for recording any important decision, not limited to architecture, making it useful across departments.
- **Functional specifications tutorial** guides teams through writing clear functional specs that bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.
- **System quality attributes (SQAs)** defines measurable characteristics such as performance, reliability, security, and maintainability that determine whether a system meets its goals.
- **Queueing theory** provides the mathematical foundation for understanding bottlenecks, throughput, and wait times in systems ranging from server infrastructure to customer service workflows.

## Strategy and planning projects

These projects address how organizations define direction and communicate vision:

- **Business model canvas (BMC)** provides a one-page framework for mapping out key business components including value propositions, customer segments, revenue streams, and cost structures.
- **Intent plan** helps teams articulate what they intend to achieve and why, aligning stakeholders before committing to detailed execution plans.
- **Pitch deck quick start** accelerates the creation of investor-ready presentations by providing structure and guidance on what to include and how to present it.
- **Strategic Balanced Scorecard (SBS)** translates organizational strategy into measurable objectives across financial, customer, internal process, and learning perspectives.
- **Value Stream Mapping (VSM)** visualizes the flow of materials and information through a process, identifying waste and opportunities for improvement.

## Measurement and metrics projects

Effective organizations measure what matters. These projects provide frameworks for defining and tracking success:

- **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)** helps teams select and define the metrics that best reflect progress toward strategic objectives.
- **Key Risk Indicator (KRI)** focuses on early warning metrics that signal when risks are increasing, enabling proactive management.
- **Objectives & Key Results (OKR)** provides a goal-setting methodology that connects ambitious objectives to measurable results.
- **Outputs vs. outcomes (OVO)** clarifies the critical distinction between what a team produces and the impact that production has on users and the business.
- **SMART criteria** ensures that goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

## Team and culture projects

Building effective teams requires intentional effort around communication, norms, and shared values:

- **Company culture** explores how organizational values, behaviors, and practices shape the work environment and influence outcomes.
- **Crucial conversations** provides techniques for navigating high-stakes discussions where opinions vary and emotions run strong.
- **Icebreaker questions** offers practical tools for building rapport and psychological safety in new or evolving teams.
- **Ways of Working (WOW)** establishes explicit agreements about how a team collaborates, communicates, and makes decisions.
- **TEAM FOCUS** provides a structured teamwork framework for aligning team efforts around shared priorities.
- **Code of conduct guidelines** defines expected behavior standards that create inclusive, respectful professional environments.

## Decision and process frameworks

These projects equip professionals with structured approaches to thinking and acting:

- **OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)** is a decision cycle framework originally developed for military strategy, widely applied in business for rapid, iterative decision-making.
- **Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM)** clarifies who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed for each task or deliverable.
- **Maturity models (MMs)** provide staged frameworks for assessing and improving organizational capabilities over time.
- **Oblique strategies** offers lateral thinking prompts that break teams out of conventional patterns when solving problems.
- **Social value orientation (SVO)** examines how individuals weigh their own outcomes against the outcomes of others, which is relevant to negotiation and collaboration.

## Governance and compliance projects

These projects address the contractual and ethical dimensions of professional work:

- **Coordinated disclosure** provides guidelines for responsibly reporting and managing security vulnerabilities.
- **Statement of Work (SOW) template** offers a structured format for defining project scope, deliverables, timelines, and terms between parties.

## How to use related projects effectively

Professionals get the most value from these resources by following a deliberate approach:

- **Start with your immediate need.** If you are preparing a pitch, begin with the pitch deck quick start and business model canvas. If you are setting up a new team, start with ways of working and company culture.
- **Follow the connections.** Each project naturally references concepts covered in others. An OKR initiative benefits from understanding KPIs, SMART criteria, and outputs vs. outcomes.
- **Adapt to your context.** These are templates and frameworks, not rigid prescriptions. Modify them to fit your organization's size, industry, and maturity level.
- **Contribute back.** As open source projects, they benefit from community contributions including corrections, examples, and translations.

## Related

Professionals exploring these related projects should also study topics such as agile methodology and its various frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe), lean startup principles, design thinking, project management fundamentals including work breakdown structures and critical path analysis, software development life cycle models, stakeholder management, risk management frameworks, and organizational change management. These adjacent disciplines provide the broader context in which the related projects operate and deepen a professional's ability to apply them effectively.

## Summary

The collection of related projects represents a curated, interconnected set of open source resources spanning architecture, strategy, measurement, teamwork, decision-making, and governance. Each project focuses on a specific tool or framework that technology professionals encounter throughout their careers. Used together, they form a comprehensive reference library that supports everything from day-to-day team operations to long-term strategic planning. Their open source nature ensures accessibility and encourages continuous improvement through community participation.
