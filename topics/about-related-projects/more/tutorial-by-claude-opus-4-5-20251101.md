## Categories of Related Projects

The projects fall into several functional categories, each addressing different aspects of technology leadership and management.

| Category | Focus Area | Key Projects |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Decision Making | Capturing and communicating architectural and business decisions | Architecture Decision Record, Decision Record Template, OODA Loop |

| Documentation | Specifications and agreements | Functional Specifications, Statement of Work, Intent Plan |

## Decision-Making Frameworks

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

ADRs document significant architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They create a historical record that helps new team members understand why systems are built a certain way and prevent revisiting settled debates.

### Decision Record Template

A generalized version of ADRs applicable beyond software architecture. Decision Records capture any significant organizational or project decision, making them valuable for cross-functional teams.

### OODA Loop

The Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop provides a mental model for rapid decision-making under uncertainty. Originally developed for military strategy, it applies directly to fast-moving technology environments where competitive advantage depends on speed.

## Strategic Planning Tools

### Business Model Canvas

The BMC provides a single-page visual framework for describing, designing, and pivoting business models. It covers nine building blocks: customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure.

### Objectives and Key Results (OKR)

OKRs connect ambitious goals (Objectives) to measurable outcomes (Key Results). This goal-setting methodology, popularized by Intel and Google, aligns individual, team, and organizational priorities.

### SMART Criteria

SMART ensures goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This framework transforms vague intentions into actionable targets.

### Strategic Balanced Scorecard

The SBS extends financial metrics to include customer, internal process, and learning perspectives. It provides a holistic view of organizational performance.

## Performance Measurement

### Key Performance Indicators (KPI)

KPIs are quantifiable measures that evaluate success against strategic objectives. Effective KPIs are specific, measurable, and directly tied to business outcomes.

### Key Risk Indicators (KRI)

KRIs provide early warning signals for potential risks. They enable proactive risk management by identifying trends before they become critical issues.

### Maturity Models

Maturity models assess organizational capability across defined levels. They provide roadmaps for improvement and benchmarks for comparison against industry standards.

## Team Collaboration Resources

### Ways of Working (WOW)

WOW documents team agreements about communication, decision-making, and collaboration. Explicit working agreements reduce friction and accelerate team formation.

### Company Culture

This resource explores how organizational values, beliefs, and behaviors shape outcomes. Understanding culture enables intentional design of high-performing environments.

### Crucial Conversations

Frameworks for handling high-stakes discussions where emotions run strong and opinions differ. These skills prove essential for technology leaders navigating complex organizational dynamics.

### TEAM FOCUS Framework

A structured approach to teamwork that addresses common dysfunctions and provides concrete practices for improvement.

### Icebreaker Questions

Practical questions for building rapport in new teams or cross-functional groups. These facilitate psychological safety and open communication.

## Documentation Standards

### Functional Specifications Tutorial

Guidance on writing clear, complete functional specifications that bridge business requirements and technical implementation.

### Statement of Work Template

SOW templates define project scope, deliverables, timelines, and terms. They establish clear expectations between parties and reduce disputes.

### Intent Plan

Intent plans communicate purpose and desired outcomes while allowing flexibility in execution. They enable autonomous decision-making aligned with strategic direction.

### Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM)

RAM clarifies who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed for each task or decision. The RACI model eliminates ambiguity about roles.

## Specialized Frameworks

### Coordinated Disclosure

Guidelines for responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities. Essential for organizations handling sensitive systems or data.

### Code of Conduct Guidelines

Templates and guidance for establishing behavioral expectations in professional and open-source communities.

### Queueing Theory

Mathematical frameworks for understanding waiting lines and system capacity. Applicable to service design, infrastructure planning, and user experience optimization.

### Value Stream Mapping

VSM visualizes the flow of materials and information required to deliver value. It identifies waste and opportunities for process improvement.

### Outputs vs. Outcomes

Distinguishes between what teams produce (outputs) and the value delivered (outcomes). This distinction shifts focus from activity to impact.

### Social Value Orientation

Explores how individual preferences for cooperation versus competition affect team dynamics and negotiation outcomes.

### Oblique Strategies

Creative thinking prompts that break conventional thought patterns. Useful when teams face novel challenges or feel stuck.

### Pitch Deck Quick Start

Templates and guidance for creating investor presentations. Covers essential elements and common pitfalls.

### System Quality Attributes

SQAs define non-functional requirements like performance, security, and maintainability. They ensure systems meet operational needs beyond feature functionality.

## How to Use These Resources

- **Start with immediate needs**: Select projects addressing current challenges rather than attempting comprehensive adoption
- **Fork and customize**: These templates work best when adapted to organizational context
- **Combine complementary tools**: OKRs pair well with KPIs; ADRs complement functional specifications
- **Iterate based on feedback**: Treat these as living documents that evolve with organizational learning

## Selecting the Right Framework

| If You Need To... | Consider Using |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Document technical decisions | Architecture Decision Record |
| Set team goals | OKR + SMART Criteria |
| Improve process efficiency | Value Stream Mapping |
| Measure organizational capability | Maturity Models |
| Establish team norms | Ways of Working |
| Define project scope | Statement of Work |
| Track business health | KPI + Strategic Balanced Scorecard |
| Manage security disclosures | Coordinated Disclosure |

## Benefits of Open-Source Resources

These repositories offer distinct advantages over proprietary alternatives:

- **Transparency**: Full visibility into methodology and reasoning
- **Customization**: Freedom to modify for specific organizational needs
- **Community**: Contributions and improvements from practitioners worldwide
- **Cost**: No licensing fees or vendor lock-in
- **Longevity**: Not dependent on any single vendor's business model

## Conclusion

This collection of related projects provides technology professionals with a comprehensive toolkit for strategy, decision-making, measurement, and collaboration. By leveraging these open-source resources, teams can adopt proven practices while maintaining the flexibility to adapt them to their unique contexts. The interconnected nature of these frameworks means that mastering one often creates natural pathways to applying others, building organizational capability incrementally over time.
