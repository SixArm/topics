  <p>To document significant architectural decisions along with their context and consequences</p>
  <p>Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are a key documentation practice for capturing important architectural choices made during a project. They record the decision, the context in which it was made, the options considered, and the rationale for the chosen approach. This helps teams understand why certain technical decisions were made, facilitates onboarding of new team members, and provides a historical record that can be referenced when revisiting or reconsidering architectural choices in the future.</p>
