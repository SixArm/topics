# About Related Projects: Tutorial

## Overview

The Agile Change Guide is part of a broader ecosystem of open-source projects created by the author, Joel Parker Henderson. These related projects cover startup strategy, tactics, and tools across a wide range of disciplines, from architecture decision records and functional specifications to objectives and key results, value stream mapping, and more. This tutorial introduces these related resources, explains how they connect to agile change work, and provides practical guidance for leveraging them in your professional development.

## Key Concepts

### The Interconnected Nature of Agile Change Work

Agile change does not happen in isolation. Effective change management requires knowledge that spans technology, business, strategy, communication, and organizational design. The related projects reflect this reality by covering a broad range of complementary topics:

- **Decision-making frameworks.** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), Decision Records (DRs), and the OODA loop provide structured approaches to making and documenting decisions.
- **Strategic planning.** Business model canvas (BMC), strategic balanced scorecard (SBS), and objectives and key results (OKRs) help organizations align their activities with strategic goals.
- **Performance measurement.** Key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs) provide the metrics needed to track progress and identify risks.
- **Project execution.** Statements of work (SOWs), responsibility assignment matrices (RAMs), and SMART criteria help teams define, assign, and execute work effectively.
- **Team and culture.** Company culture, ways of working (WOW), TEAM FOCUS, and code of conduct guidelines address the human and organizational dimensions of change.
- **Communication and collaboration.** Crucial conversations, icebreaker questions, and social value orientation provide tools for better human interaction.
- **Technical practices.** Functional specifications, system quality attributes, value stream mapping (VSM), and queueing theory connect agile change to technical and process improvement disciplines.

### Open Source as a Learning Model

All of the related projects are free, libre, and open source. This means you can read, use, adapt, and contribute to any of them. Open-source knowledge resources have several advantages for professional learning:

- **Accessibility.** Anyone can access the content, regardless of budget or organizational affiliation.
- **Currency.** Open-source projects can be updated continuously, reflecting the latest thinking and best practices.
- **Community.** Contributors from diverse backgrounds improve the quality and breadth of the content.
- **Transparency.** The full history of changes is visible, allowing you to see how the content has evolved.

### Building a Personal Knowledge System

The related projects can serve as building blocks for a personal knowledge system. Rather than trying to learn everything at once, you can focus on the topics most relevant to your current challenges and expand your knowledge over time.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Audit your knowledge gaps.** Review the list of related projects and identify the topics where you have the least knowledge or experience. Prioritize these for learning.

2. **Start with what is most relevant.** If you are currently working on organizational change, start with objectives and key results (OKRs), ways of working (WOW), or company culture. If you are focused on technical decisions, begin with architecture decision records (ADRs) or system quality attributes.

3. **Clone the repositories.** Clone the repositories for the projects you want to study. This gives you local access to all the content and allows you to annotate, experiment, and practice.

4. **Integrate practices into your daily work.** Do not just read about ADRs or OKRs -- start using them. Create an architecture decision record for your next significant decision. Write a statement of work for your next project. Use SMART criteria for your next set of goals.

5. **Share what you learn.** When you discover a useful practice or framework from one of the related projects, share it with your team. Propose a lunch-and-learn or a working session to introduce the concept.

6. **Contribute back.** If you find errors, have suggestions, or develop improvements to any of the related projects, contribute through pull requests or issues on GitHub. This helps the community and deepens your own understanding.

7. **Build cross-disciplinary fluency.** Use the related projects to build competence across technology, business, and organizational dimensions. The most effective agile change professionals are those who can operate fluently across these domains.

8. **Create your own resource library.** Curate a personal collection of the most useful frameworks, templates, and guides from the related projects. Organize them for easy reference and update them as your practice evolves.

## Key Takeaway

The related projects represent a rich ecosystem of knowledge that extends and complements the Agile Change Guide. For agile change technology professionals, these resources offer practical frameworks, templates, and insights that can be applied directly to your work. By exploring these projects, integrating their practices into your daily work, and contributing your own improvements, you build a comprehensive toolkit for driving effective change. The breadth of these resources reflects the reality that agile change is an interdisciplinary endeavor -- and the most impactful professionals are those who invest in learning across domains.
