# Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers

"Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 8.

Lean-Agile leaders understand that ideation, innovation, and employee engagement
are not generally motivated by individual incentive compensation. Such
individual incentives can create internal competition and destroy the
cooperation necessary to achieve the larger aim of the system. Providing
autonomy and purpose, minimizing constraints, creating an environment of mutual
influence, and better understanding the role of compensation are keys to higher
levels of employee engagement. This approach yields better outcomes for
individuals, customers, and the enterprise.
