  <p>Buy-in implies genuine belief and support while compliance may lack true commitment</p>
  <p>Buy-in represents a genuine belief in the value and importance of a project or decision, creating shared ownership and commitment. Compliance, in contrast, means someone may follow a directive without actually supporting it, which can lead to resentment and resistance over time. For technology professionals, understanding this distinction is critical when leading initiatives—securing true buy-in from stakeholders leads to better collaboration and project success, while mere compliance can undermine long-term outcomes.</p>
