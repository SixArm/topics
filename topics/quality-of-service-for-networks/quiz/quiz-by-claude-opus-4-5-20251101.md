# Quality of Service (QoS) for networks

Question: What is the primary purpose of Quality of Service (QoS) in network management?

- [ ] To increase the total bandwidth capacity of a network
- [ ] To encrypt network traffic for enhanced security
- [ ] To prioritize and manage network traffic so critical applications receive necessary resources to meet performance requirements
- [ ] To reduce the physical hardware costs of network infrastructure

  <p>To prioritize and manage network traffic so critical applications receive necessary resources to meet performance requirements</p>
  <p>QoS enables network administrators to ensure that time-sensitive and mission-critical applications—such as VoIP, video streaming, and online gaming—receive sufficient network resources, while preventing less critical traffic from degrading their performance. This is achieved through mechanisms like traffic shaping, congestion avoidance, and packet scheduling implemented in routers, switches, and firewalls.</p>
