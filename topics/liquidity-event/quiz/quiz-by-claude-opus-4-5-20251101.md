  <p>To convert ownership stakes into cash or liquid assets</p>
  <p>A liquidity event is a financial event that provides the opportunity for investors, employees, and other stakeholders to sell their ownership or equity interest in a company for cash or other liquid assets. For startups, this is often a major goal, as it allows early investors and employees to realize returns on their investments and equity stakes. Common examples include IPOs, mergers, acquisitions, and share repurchases.</p>
