# Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

Question: What is the defining characteristic that makes a Markov Model "hidden"?

- [ ] The model uses encryption to protect the state data
- [ ] The transition probabilities between states are unknown
- [ ] The underlying states are not directly observable
- [ ] The output symbols are randomly generated

  <p>The underlying states are not directly observable</p>
  <p>In a Hidden Markov Model, the "hidden" refers to the fact that the system's internal states cannot be directly observed. Instead, we only observe the outputs (emissions) that the system produces based on those hidden states. The model infers the most likely sequence of hidden states from the observable output sequence using learned transition and emission probabilities.</p>
