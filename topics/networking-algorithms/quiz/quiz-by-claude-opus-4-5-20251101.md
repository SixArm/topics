# Networking algorithms

Question: Which networking algorithm category is primarily responsible for determining the optimal path for data packets to travel across a network?

- [ ] Congestion Control Algorithms
- [ ] Load Balancing Algorithms
- [ ] Routing Algorithms
- [ ] Error Detection and Correction Algorithms

  <p>Routing Algorithms</p>
  <p>Routing algorithms, such as RIP (Routing Information Protocol), are specifically designed to determine the best path for data traffic in a network. While congestion control manages network traffic flow, load balancing distributes traffic across servers, and error detection ensures data integrity, routing algorithms are the fundamental category responsible for path selection and directing packets from source to destination.</p>
