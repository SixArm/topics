  <p>"Plans are worthless. Planning is essential." ~ Dwight D. Eisenhower</p>
  <p>Eisenhower's quotation emphasizes that while specific plans often become obsolete due to changing circumstances, the planning process itself builds understanding, identifies risks, develops contingencies, and prepares teams to adapt. This insight is fundamental to agile and adaptive project management approaches where the value lies in continuous planning rather than rigid adherence to a fixed plan.</p>
