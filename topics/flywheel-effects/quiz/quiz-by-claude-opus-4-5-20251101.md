  <p>Small, continuous efforts compound over time to build momentum and create a positive feedback loop</p>
  <p>The flywheel effect is based on the principle that every action taken can have a cumulative effect on overall performance. As a business continues to take consistent, small actions that contribute to its success, momentum builds, creating a positive feedback loop that reinforces and amplifies its efforts. This approach, exemplified by Amazon's customer-centric strategy, emphasizes sustained incremental improvements rather than single large initiatives.</p>
