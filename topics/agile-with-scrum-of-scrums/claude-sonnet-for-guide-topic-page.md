# Agile with Scrum of Scrums

Agile with Scrum of Scrums represents a scaled approach to software engineering that extends the traditional Scrum framework to coordinate multiple teams working on large, complex projects. This methodology addresses the challenges of inter-team communication and dependency management in enterprise-level software development.

In the Scrum of Scrums model, each individual Scrum team operates autonomously with their own Product Owner, Scrum Master, and development team members. These teams follow standard Scrum practices including sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. However, the framework introduces an additional coordination layer where representatives from each team participate in regular Scrum of Scrums meetings, typically held two to three times per week.

During these coordination meetings, team representatives address four key questions: what has their team accomplished since the last meeting, what will they accomplish before the next meeting, what impediments are blocking progress, and what work might impact other teams. This structure enables early identification of dependencies, conflicts, and integration issues across multiple development streams.

Scrum of Scrums particularly benefits organizations developing large software systems requiring coordination between multiple specialized teams, such as front-end, back-end, infrastructure, and quality assurance teams. By maintaining agile principles while adding necessary coordination mechanisms, this scaled approach enables organizations to deliver complex software products efficiently while managing the inherent challenges of distributed development efforts.
