  <p>To coordinate across multiple teams and identify inter-team dependencies, conflicts, and integration issues</p>
  <p>Scrum of Scrums meetings serve as a coordination layer where representatives from each team address what their team has accomplished, what they will accomplish next, what impediments exist, and what work might impact other teams. This structure enables early identification of dependencies, conflicts, and integration issues across multiple development streams while allowing individual teams to maintain their autonomy and standard Scrum practices.</p>
