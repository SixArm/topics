  <p>Internationalization prepares the product to handle regional differences, while localization adapts content for specific target markets</p>
  <p>Internationalization (i18n) involves planning, analyzing, designing, and developing software to handle various character sets, date/time formats, and other regional differences. Localization (l10n) then takes that internationalized product and adapts it for specific markets through translation, cultural adaptation, and formatting adjustments. Testing and maintenance are shared steps that apply to both processes.</p>
