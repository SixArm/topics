# Load testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of integrating automated load testing into CI/CD pipelines?

- [ ] To replace the need for unit testing and code reviews
- [ ] To eliminate the requirement for production environment monitoring
- [ ] To detect performance regressions early and maintain consistent quality standards
- [ ] To reduce the number of developers needed on a project

  <p>To detect performance regressions early and maintain consistent quality standards</p>
  <p>Integrating automated load testing into CI/CD pipelines enables continuous performance validation throughout the development lifecycle. This allows teams to identify performance degradations as soon as they are introduced, rather than discovering issues after deployment. Early detection reduces the cost and effort of fixing performance problems and ensures the application consistently meets defined performance criteria.</p>
