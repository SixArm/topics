  <p>No-code platforms eliminate the need for any coding, while low-code platforms may still require some coding for complex functionality</p>
  <p>Low-code platforms provide visual development environments with drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built components, but some coding may still be necessary for complex functionality. No-code platforms take this further by eliminating the need for any coding or programming—users build applications entirely through configuration rather than writing code.</p>
