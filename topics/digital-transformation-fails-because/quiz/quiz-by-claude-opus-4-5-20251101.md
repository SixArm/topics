  <p>Lack of committed leadership and clear direction</p>
  <p>Inadequate leadership is often cited as the primary root cause of digital transformation failure because leaders are responsible for championing the transformation, providing strategic alignment, allocating resources, making timely decisions, and fostering a culture that embraces change. Without committed leadership, other issues like resistance to change, misaligned strategy, and insufficient capabilities tend to follow. Technology selection and budget are secondary concerns that effective leadership can address.</p>
