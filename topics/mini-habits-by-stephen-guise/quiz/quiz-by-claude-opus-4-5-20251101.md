  <p>Creating small, easy-to-achieve goals that require minimal willpower and build momentum over time</p>
  <p>Guise argues that traditional goal-setting strategies relying on motivation and willpower often fail because they require significant effort that is difficult to sustain. Instead, mini habits are designed to be so small (completable in less than two minutes) that they become almost effortless, creating a positive feedback loop of success that builds momentum toward larger goals.</p>
