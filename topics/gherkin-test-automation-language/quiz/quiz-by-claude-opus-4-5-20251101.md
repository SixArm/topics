  <p>To structure test scenarios by establishing context, describing actions, and specifying expected outcomes</p>
  <p>In Gherkin, the Given-When-Then format serves a specific purpose: "Given" establishes the initial context or preconditions, "When" describes the action or event that triggers the behavior, and "Then" specifies the expected outcome or result. This structure makes test scenarios readable by all stakeholders while providing a clear, logical flow for behavior-driven development.</p>
