# Gherkin - test automation language

Gherkin is a plain-text language designed for writing test scenarios in behavior-driven development (BDD) frameworks, most notably Cucumber. Gherkin bridge providing a human-readable format for describing software behavior. The language uses simple English keywords to structure test cases, making them accessible to stakeholders, business analysts, developers, and testers alike.

Scenarios are written in a Given-When-Then format. "Given" establishes the initial context or preconditions, "When" describes the action or event that triggers the behavior, and "Then" specifies the expected outcome or result. Additional keywords like "And" and "But" can be used to extend these steps, while "Background" allows for common setup steps across multiple scenarios within a feature file.

Gherkin scenarios are organized into feature files that describe a particular functionality or user story. Each feature contains one or more scenarios that outline different ways the feature should behave under various conditions. This approach encourages teams to think about software requirements from the user's perspective and helps ensure that development efforts align with business objectives.

The real power of Gherkin lies in its integration with automation frameworks like Cucumber, which can execute these human-readable scenarios as automated tests. Step definitions written in programming languages like Rust, Java, Ruby, or JavaScript connect the plain-text steps to actual code that interacts with the application under test. This combination enables teams to maintain living documentation that serves both as specification and as executable tests, ensuring that the software behavior remains consistent with stakeholder expectations.
