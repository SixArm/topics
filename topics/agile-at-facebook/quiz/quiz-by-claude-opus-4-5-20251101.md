  <p>Data-driven decision making through A/B testing integrated into sprint cycles</p>
  <p>Facebook's agile approach prioritizes speed and experimentation by deploying multiple versions of features simultaneously to different user segments, gathering real-time performance data within each sprint. This allows teams to make informed decisions quickly rather than relying on lengthy planning phases, exemplifying their "move fast and break things" philosophy.</p>
