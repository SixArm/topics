# Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

Question: What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) from narrow AI?

- [ ] AGI requires more computational power than narrow AI
- [ ] AGI can understand and generate human language
- [ ] AGI can perform any intellectual task a human can do across a wide range of domains
- [ ] AGI uses deep learning algorithms exclusively

  <p>AGI can perform any intellectual task a human can do across a wide range of domains</p>
  <p>The defining characteristic of AGI is its versatility and human-like cognitive abilities across multiple domains. Unlike narrow AI, which excels at specific tasks, AGI aims to understand, learn, and apply knowledge comparable to human intelligence across any intellectual task. While language understanding is one capability of AGI, the fundamental distinction is its generalization ability—being able to adapt, learn, and perform well in various tasks rather than being limited to a single domain.</p>
