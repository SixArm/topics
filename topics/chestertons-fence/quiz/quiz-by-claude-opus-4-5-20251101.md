  <p>Understand why something exists before changing or removing it</p>
  <p>Chesterton's fence is a principle of cautionary conservatism stating that before changing or removing something, you should first understand why it exists. Even if a practice or system seems pointless, it likely served some purpose that may not be immediately apparent. For technology professionals, this means investigating the history and rationale behind existing code, configurations, or processes before refactoring or removing them—helping avoid unintended consequences.</p>
