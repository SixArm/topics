# Quick sort algorithm

Question: What is the fundamental strategy that quick sort uses to sort an array?

- [ ] Repeatedly finding the minimum element and placing it at the beginning
- [ ] Merging sorted halves of the array together
- [ ] Selecting a pivot and partitioning elements into sub-arrays based on comparison to the pivot
- [ ] Comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order

  <p>Selecting a pivot and partitioning elements into sub-arrays based on comparison to the pivot</p>
  <p>Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a "pivot" element, then partitioning other elements into two sub-arrays—those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. These sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This partitioning approach is what distinguishes quick sort from other sorting algorithms like selection sort, merge sort, or bubble sort.</p>
