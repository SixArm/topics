  <p>Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next phase</p>
  <p>The Waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequential approach where development flows downward through distinct phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, maintenance). Each phase must be fully completed before the next one begins, which is why it's called "Waterfall." This rigid structure makes it suitable for projects with well-understood, stable requirements, but can be inflexible when changes are needed.</p>
