# Security testing

Question: What is the primary difference between vulnerability testing and penetration testing?

- [ ] Vulnerability testing verifies encryption algorithms, while penetration testing checks authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Vulnerability testing scans for known security holes, while penetration testing simulates actual attacks to assess security effectiveness
- [ ] Vulnerability testing checks user access controls, while penetration testing verifies network settings
- [ ] Vulnerability testing and penetration testing are identical processes with different names

  <p>Vulnerability testing scans for known security holes, while penetration testing simulates actual attacks to assess security effectiveness</p>
  <p>Vulnerability testing focuses on scanning systems for known vulnerabilities and security holes in a systematic way. Penetration testing goes further by actively simulating an attack on the system to identify potential vulnerabilities and assess how well existing security measures hold up under realistic attack conditions. Understanding this distinction is crucial for technology professionals because both approaches serve complementary purposes in a comprehensive security testing strategy.</p>
