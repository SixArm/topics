# Seed round

A seed round is the earliest formal round of equity financing that a startup raises from external investors. It typically occurs after founders have validated a concept, built an initial product or prototype, and need capital to move from idea-stage to early traction. Seed funding bridges the gap between bootstrapping or friends-and-family contributions and a full Series A raise, providing the resources a young company needs to prove its business model, acquire early customers, and demonstrate growth potential.

## Purpose and Timing

A seed round is designed to fund the transition from concept to viable business. At this stage, a startup usually has a minimum viable product or working prototype, some early user feedback, and a founding team in place, but lacks the revenue or track record to attract larger institutional investment.

Founders pursue a seed round when they need capital to accomplish specific milestones that will make the company attractive for subsequent funding. These milestones commonly include achieving product-market fit, building out a core team, generating initial revenue, and establishing key performance metrics that Series A investors will evaluate.

The timing varies by industry and business model. Software startups may raise a seed round within 6 to 18 months of founding, while hardware or biotech ventures may take longer due to prototyping and regulatory requirements.

## Typical Funding Amounts and Sources

Seed rounds vary considerably in size depending on the market, geography, and the startup's needs. The following table outlines general ranges and their corresponding investor profiles.

| Funding Range | Common Sources | Typical Context |
|---|---|---|
| $50,000 - $500,000 | Angel investors, angel syndicates | Pre-product or early prototype stage |
| $500,000 - $2,000,000 | Seed-stage venture capital firms, accelerator follow-on | Post-MVP with early traction |
| $2,000,000 - $5,000,000 | Institutional seed funds, multi-stage VC firms | Competitive markets, capital-intensive models |

Common sources of seed capital include:

- **Angel investors** — High-net-worth individuals who invest personal funds, often providing mentorship alongside capital.
- **Seed-stage venture capital firms** — Funds specifically structured to invest at the earliest institutional stage, such as Precursor Ventures, Hustle Fund, or First Round Capital.
- **Accelerators and incubators** — Programs like Y Combinator, Techstars, and 500 Global that provide small amounts of capital in exchange for equity, plus structured mentorship.
- **Crowdfunding platforms** — Equity crowdfunding through platforms such as Republic or Wefunder, used increasingly as a complement to traditional seed raises.

## Deal Structure and Terms

Seed rounds can be structured in several ways, each with distinct legal and financial implications.

| Structure | Description | When Typically Used |
|---|---|---|
| SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) | Converts to equity at a future priced round; no interest or maturity date | Most common for early seed raises; standard Y Combinator instrument |
| Convertible note | Debt instrument that converts to equity at the next priced round; includes interest rate and maturity date | Common when investors want downside protection |
| Priced equity round | Formal stock issuance with a set valuation and defined share price | Used when the round is large or led by an institutional investor |

Key terms that founders and investors negotiate during a seed round include:

- **Valuation cap** — The maximum company valuation at which a SAFE or convertible note will convert to equity, protecting early investors from excessive dilution.
- **Discount rate** — A percentage discount (commonly 15-25%) applied to the share price at the next round, rewarding seed investors for early risk.
- **Pro-rata rights** — The right for seed investors to maintain their ownership percentage by participating in future rounds.
- **Board seats** — Seed investors occasionally negotiate a board seat or board observer role, though this is less common than at Series A.

## How Founders Prepare for a Seed Round

Raising a seed round requires deliberate preparation across several dimensions.

- **Pitch deck** — A concise presentation covering the problem, solution, market size, business model, traction, team, and funding ask. Typically 10-15 slides.
- **Financial model** — A projection of revenue, expenses, and cash runway, demonstrating how the seed capital will be deployed and what milestones it will fund.
- **Data room** — Organized documentation including incorporation papers, cap table, intellectual property filings, customer contracts, and any prior funding agreements.
- **Traction evidence** — Metrics such as monthly active users, revenue growth rate, customer acquisition cost, or letters of intent from potential customers.
- **Team narrative** — A clear articulation of why this founding team is uniquely positioned to execute on the opportunity, including relevant domain expertise and prior accomplishments.

## Advantages and Risks

Seed funding offers significant benefits but also carries meaningful risks for both founders and investors.

**For founders:**

- Provides capital to hire, build product, and acquire customers before revenue can sustain operations.
- Validates the business in the eyes of future investors, partners, and customers.
- Connects the founding team with experienced investors who bring networks, mentorship, and strategic guidance.
- Creates external accountability through investor updates and milestone expectations.

**For investors:**

- Offers the potential for outsized returns if the startup succeeds and grows through subsequent funding rounds and eventual exit.
- Provides early access to promising companies at relatively low valuations.
- Carries high risk, as the majority of seed-stage startups do not reach profitability or a successful exit.
- Requires patience, as seed investments are illiquid and may take 7-10 years to generate returns.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Founders frequently encounter pitfalls during the seed round process that can harm their company's trajectory.

- **Raising too little** — Insufficient capital forces premature fundraising again before milestones are met, weakening negotiating position.
- **Raising too much at too high a valuation** — An inflated seed valuation creates a "down round" risk if the company cannot grow into that valuation by Series A.
- **Neglecting due diligence on investors** — Not all capital is equal; investors who are unresponsive, adversarial, or lack relevant expertise can create long-term problems.
- **Spending before closing** — Committing to expenses based on verbal commitments before funds are wired can create cash flow crises.
- **Ignoring legal structure** — Using informal agreements or skipping legal counsel on term sheets can lead to cap table problems, disputes, and complications in future rounds.

Professionals exploring seed-round financing should also study angel investors and how they evaluate early-stage opportunities, SAFEs and convertible notes as specific financing instruments, pre-money and post-money valuation methods, capitalization tables and dilution mechanics, pitch decks and how to present to investors effectively, Series A funding and the milestones required to progress beyond the seed stage, accelerator and incubator programs, due diligence processes, and product-market fit as the primary goal that seed capital is meant to achieve.

## Summary

A seed round is the foundational fundraising event for most venture-backed startups, providing the capital needed to move from prototype to early traction. It typically ranges from $100,000 to $5 million, sourced from angel investors, seed-stage venture firms, and accelerators. Deal structures most commonly use SAFEs or convertible notes, with priced rounds reserved for larger or institutionally-led raises. Success at the seed stage depends on disciplined preparation, clear milestone planning, selecting investors who add strategic value, and deploying capital efficiently toward achieving product-market fit and the metrics required to raise a Series A.
