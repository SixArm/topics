  <p>The company gives up partial ownership and control in exchange for capital that does not require repayment</p>
  <p>Equity financing involves selling ownership shares (equity) to investors who become part-owners of the company. Unlike debt financing, the capital raised does not need to be repaid—instead, investors receive returns through dividends or capital gains. However, this dilutes the founders' ownership and control, as new shareholders gain voting rights and may have different opinions and goals for the company's direction.</p>
