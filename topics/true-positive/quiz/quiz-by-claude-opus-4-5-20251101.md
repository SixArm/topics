# True positive

Question: In a machine learning classification model, what does a true positive represent?

- [ ] A prediction where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class

  <p>A prediction where the model correctly predicts the positive class</p>
  <p>A true positive occurs when the model predicts a positive outcome and that prediction is correct. For example, if a medical diagnostic model predicts that a patient has a tumor, and the patient actually does have a tumor, this is a true positive. It represents the model successfully identifying a positive case, which is essential for calculating metrics like precision and recall.</p>
