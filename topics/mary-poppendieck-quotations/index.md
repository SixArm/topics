# Mary Poppendieck quotations

Mary Poppendieck, a pioneering voice in agile software development, emphasizes the fundamental importance of delivering customer value. 

Her approach to quality management draws heavily from lean manufacturing principles. Poppendieck argues that "quality is not negotiable" and that teams should "build quality in" rather than attempting to test it in later. She believes that defects should be addressed immediately when discovered, preventing them from propagating through the development process and becoming more expensive to fix.

Poppendieck strongly advocates for empowering development teams and eliminating waste in software processes. She states that "the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams" and emphasizes that management should focus on creating environments where teams can thrive rather than micromanaging their work.

Her perspective on learning and adaptation is central to agile success. She encourages teams to "decide as late as possible" and "deliver as fast as possible," recognizing that software development is inherently a learning process where requirements and understanding evolve continuously.

Perhaps most importantly, Poppendieck views software development as a creative discipline rather than a manufacturing process. She argues that "software development is not a manufacturing process; it's a design process" and that treating it as such leads to more innovative solutions and better outcomes for both developers and customers.
