  <p>To structure test scenarios by establishing context, describing actions, and specifying expected outcomes</p>
  <p>Gherkin uses a structured syntax where "Given" establishes the initial context or preconditions, "When" describes the action or event being tested, and "Then" specifies the expected outcome or result. This format makes test scenarios readable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders while ensuring business requirements are clearly documented and testable.</p>
