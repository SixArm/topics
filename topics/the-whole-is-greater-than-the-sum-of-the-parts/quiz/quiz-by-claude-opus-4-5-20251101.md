  <p>Synergy - combined elements create outcomes exceeding individual contributions</p>
  <p>Aristotle's quote encapsulates the concept of synergy, where the combination or integration of individual elements results in an outcome that is more significant than the mere sum of those individual components. In technology teams, this means effective collaboration and the interplay between diverse skills, knowledge, and perspectives can achieve results that exceed what each person could accomplish individually.</p>
