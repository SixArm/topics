# Code coverage

Code coverage is a metric in software testing automation that measures the percentage of code executed during automated test runs. It serves as a quantitative indicator of how thoroughly your test suite exercises the application's codebase.

There are several types of code coverage measurements, each providing different insights. Line coverage tracks which lines of code are executed, while branch coverage measures whether all possible decision paths are taken. Function coverage indicates which functions are called during testing, and statement coverage shows which individual statements are executed. More advanced metrics include condition coverage, which examines whether all boolean expressions are evaluated to both true and false values.

Modern testing frameworks automatically generate code coverage reports, making it easy to integrate into continuous integration pipelines. Popular tools provide  visualizations showing covered and uncovered code sections. These reports often use color coding, with green indicating covered code and red highlighting areas that need attention.

While high code coverage is generally desirable, it's important to understand its limitations. Achieving 100% coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free software, as tests might execute code without properly validating outcomes. Quality matters more than quantity â€“ well-designed tests that cover critical business logic and edge cases are more valuable than numerous superficial tests that merely increase coverage percentages.

Code coverage works best when combined with other testing metrics and practices. It should guide testing efforts rather than become an end goal, helping teams focus on writing meaningful tests that improve software reliability and maintainability.
