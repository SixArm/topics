# Code coverage

Question: What is the most important consideration when interpreting code coverage metrics in software testing?

- [ ] Coverage reports should always use green and red color coding to be valid
- [ ] Higher coverage percentages always indicate better software quality
- [ ] High coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free software since tests might execute code without properly validating outcomes
- [ ] Line coverage is the only meaningful type of coverage measurement

  <p>High coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free software since tests might execute code without properly validating outcomes</p>
  <p>While high code coverage is generally desirable, achieving 100% coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free software. Tests might execute code without properly validating outcomes. Quality matters more than quantity—well-designed tests that cover critical business logic and edge cases are more valuable than numerous superficial tests that merely increase coverage percentages.</p>
