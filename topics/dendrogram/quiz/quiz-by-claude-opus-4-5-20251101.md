# Dendrogram

Question: In a dendrogram, what does the length of the branches connecting nodes indicate?

- [ ] The number of data points in each cluster
- [ ] The degree of similarity or dissimilarity between objects
- [ ] The chronological order in which data was collected
- [ ] The computational complexity of the clustering algorithm

  <p>The degree of similarity or dissimilarity between objects</p>
  <p>In a dendrogram, branch length is a visual representation of how similar or dissimilar connected objects are. Shorter branches indicate objects that are more similar and grouped together at lower levels of the tree, while longer branches indicate greater dissimilarity between objects or clusters being merged.</p>
