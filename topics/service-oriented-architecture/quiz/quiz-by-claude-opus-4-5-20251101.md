# Service-oriented architecture (SOA)

Question: What is the primary architectural principle behind Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)?

- [ ] Storing all business logic in a single monolithic database

  <p>Building software systems from modular, reusable services that communicate over standard protocols</p>
  <p>SOA is based on breaking down software systems into self-contained, modular services that can be deployed independently and communicate using standard protocols such as HTTP, SOAP, or REST. This enables key benefits including reusability across applications, interoperability between different platforms and languages, independent scalability, and easier maintenance since services can be updated without affecting other parts of the system.</p>
