  <p>Revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS)</p>
  <p>Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS)—which includes materials, labor, and production expenses—from total revenue. This metric shows how efficiently a company produces its goods or services before accounting for operating expenses like rent, salaries, and marketing. Understanding gross profit is essential for technology professionals analyzing product margins and making decisions about pricing, resource allocation, and operational efficiency.</p>
