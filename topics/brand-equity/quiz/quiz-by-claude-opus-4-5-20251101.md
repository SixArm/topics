  <p>Brand awareness, brand association, perceived quality, and brand loyalty</p>
  <p>Brand equity consists of four key components: (1) brand awareness—how well customers recognize the brand; (2) brand association—the qualities and attributes customers connect with the brand such as innovation and trustworthiness; (3) perceived quality—the level of quality customers expect based on reputation; and (4) brand loyalty—the commitment customers have to choosing the brand over competitors. These intangible assets create value beyond physical products and enable companies to command premium pricing and retain customers long-term.</p>
