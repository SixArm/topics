# Board of directors (BOD)

A board of directors (BOD) is a governing body elected or appointed by shareholders to oversee the strategic direction, financial health, and executive leadership of a company or organization. For technology professionals, understanding the board's role is essential whether you are a startup founder seeking funding, a CTO reporting to the board, or an engineer whose company is navigating an IPO. The board sits at the apex of corporate governance and carries fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of shareholders and stakeholders alike.

## Core Responsibilities

The board of directors carries a broad set of obligations that shape how a company operates at the highest level:

- **Set company strategy**: Establish the overall direction of the company and approve major strategic decisions such as mergers and acquisitions, entering new markets, or pivoting a product line.
- **Select and oversee the CEO**: Hire, evaluate, compensate, and, when necessary, replace the chief executive officer who runs day-to-day operations.
- **Provide financial oversight**: Ensure the company manages its finances responsibly, approves budgets, and complies with all applicable financial reporting laws and regulations.
- **Approve major expenditures**: Authorize significant capital outlays including investments in new technology, infrastructure, or equipment.
- **Ensure compliance**: Verify that the company adheres to all relevant laws and regulations covering financial reporting, labor practices, data privacy, and environmental and social responsibility.
- **Protect shareholders' interests**: Represent shareholders and ensure the company is managed in a way that maximizes long-term shareholder value while managing risk.

## Board Composition

Boards are composed of directors who bring different perspectives, expertise, and levels of independence. The following table summarizes the common types of directors found on a corporate board:

| Director Type | Description | Typical Background |
|---|---|---|
| Inside director | A current employee or executive of the company, such as the CEO or CTO | Operations, engineering, product leadership |
| Outside (independent) director | Has no material relationship with the company beyond board service | Finance, law, industry expertise, academia |
| Lead independent director | An independent director who chairs executive sessions and acts as a counterbalance to a combined CEO/Chair | Senior executive or governance experience |
| Chairperson | Presides over board meetings and sets the agenda; may or may not also serve as CEO | Varies widely |

A well-composed board balances inside knowledge of the company with outside independence and objectivity. Regulatory bodies and stock exchanges often require that a majority of directors be independent.

## Board Committees

Most boards delegate specific oversight functions to standing committees. Each committee has a charter that defines its scope and authority.

- **Audit Committee**: Oversees financial reporting, internal controls, and the relationship with external auditors. Required by law for publicly traded companies.
- **Compensation Committee**: Sets executive pay, equity incentive plans, and performance benchmarks. Ensures compensation aligns with company performance and shareholder interests.
- **Nominating and Governance Committee**: Identifies and evaluates board candidates, manages board succession planning, and maintains corporate governance standards.
- **Technology or Innovation Committee**: Increasingly common in tech companies, this committee provides oversight of technology strategy, cybersecurity risk, and R&D investment.
- **Risk Committee**: Evaluates enterprise-wide risks including operational, financial, regulatory, and reputational risks.

## Fiduciary Duties

Board members owe legally enforceable fiduciary duties to the company and its shareholders. These duties form the foundation of corporate governance:

| Duty | Definition |
|---|---|
| Duty of care | Directors must act with the care that a reasonably prudent person would use in similar circumstances, including staying informed and exercising independent judgment. |
| Duty of loyalty | Directors must put the interests of the company and its shareholders above their own personal interests, avoiding conflicts of interest. |
| Duty of obedience | Directors must ensure the organization acts in accordance with its charter, bylaws, and applicable law. |

Breach of these duties can expose directors to personal liability, which is why most boards carry directors and officers (D&O) insurance.

## Board Governance in Technology Companies

Technology companies present unique governance considerations that distinguish their boards from those in traditional industries:

- **Dual-class share structures**: Many tech firms such as Alphabet and Meta use dual-class stock that gives founders outsized voting control, which can reduce the board's ability to override founder decisions.
- **Rapid growth and pivots**: Tech companies evolve quickly, requiring boards that can make fast, informed decisions about product strategy, market entry, and capital allocation.
- **Cybersecurity oversight**: Boards are increasingly expected to understand cybersecurity risk, data privacy regulations, and the implications of AI and emerging technologies.
- **Founder-CEO dynamics**: In startups and growth-stage companies, the founder often serves as CEO and board chair, concentrating authority and requiring strong independent directors to provide checks and balances.
- **Investor board seats**: Venture capital and private equity investors typically negotiate for one or more board seats as a condition of funding, influencing governance from the earliest stages.

## Board Meetings and Operations

The BOD typically meets between four and twelve times per year, with additional special meetings called as needed for urgent matters such as acquisitions or executive transitions. Board members are expected to attend all meetings and actively participate in discussions and decision-making.

Between formal meetings, directors may engage through committee work, one-on-one calls with the CEO, board portals for document review, and informal advisory conversations. Effective boards invest time in onboarding new directors, conducting annual self-evaluations, and staying current on industry trends.

## How Technology Professionals Interact with the Board

Understanding the board's priorities helps technology leaders communicate more effectively at the governance level:

- **CTOs and VPs of Engineering** may present technology strategy, product roadmaps, and cybersecurity posture to the board or its technology committee.
- **Startup founders** build and manage their boards from the earliest funding rounds, selecting advisors and investor directors who add strategic value.
- **Security leaders (CISOs)** increasingly report directly to the board on risk posture, incident response readiness, and compliance with data protection regulations.
- **Engineering managers** benefit from understanding board-level priorities because those priorities cascade into budgets, headcount, and strategic direction for their teams.

Understanding equity structures such as employee stock option pools and 409A valuations also provides valuable context for how board decisions affect the broader organization.

## Summary

The board of directors is the highest governing body in a corporation, responsible for setting strategy, selecting and overseeing executive leadership, ensuring financial integrity, and protecting shareholder interests. For technology professionals, the board is far from an abstract concept: it shapes funding decisions, approves technology investments, oversees cybersecurity risk, and ultimately determines the strategic direction that engineering and product teams execute on every day. Whether you are building a startup, scaling a growth-stage company, or operating within a public enterprise, understanding how boards function equips you to navigate corporate governance, communicate effectively with leadership, and make better-informed career and business decisions.
