# Component diagram

Question: In a UML component diagram, what is the difference between aggregation and composition relationships?

- [ ] Aggregation uses solid lines while composition uses dashed arrows
- [ ] Aggregation indicates data flow while composition indicates control flow
- [ ] In composition, contained components cannot exist without the containing component; in aggregation, they can
- [ ] Aggregation shows dependencies while composition shows associations

  <p>In composition, contained components cannot exist without the containing component; in aggregation, they can</p>
  <p>Both aggregation and composition indicate that one component contains or is composed of other components. However, composition represents a stronger relationship where the contained components are fundamentally part of the containing component and cannot exist independently. Aggregation is a weaker "has-a" relationship where contained components can exist on their own. In UML notation, both use diamond-shaped arrows, but composition uses a filled-in diamond head to indicate the stronger dependency.</p>
