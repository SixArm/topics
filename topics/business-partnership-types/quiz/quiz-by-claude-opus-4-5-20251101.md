  <p>Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)</p>
  <p>An LLP combines the flexibility of a partnership with limited liability protection for its partners. Unlike a general partnership where partners have unlimited personal liability, LLP partners are not personally responsible for the partnership's debts or other partners' negligence. This structure is particularly popular among professional service firms like law firms, accounting practices, and consulting companies, where partners want to collaborate while protecting their personal assets from business liabilities.</p>
