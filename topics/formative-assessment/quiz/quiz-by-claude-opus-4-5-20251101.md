  <p>To provide ongoing feedback that helps learners identify strengths, weaknesses, and adjust their strategies for improvement</p>
  <p>Formative assessment is fundamentally about continuous improvement during the learning process, not final evaluation. Unlike summative assessment which measures knowledge at the end, formative assessment provides ongoing feedback throughout the learning journey, enabling learners to adjust their strategies and improve outcomes in real-time. For technology professionals, this approach is valuable in agile retrospectives, code reviews, sprint feedback cycles, and continuous learning programs.</p>
