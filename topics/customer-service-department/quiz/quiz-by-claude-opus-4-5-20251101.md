  <p>To ensure customer issues are routed to the appropriate internal teams for resolution</p>
  <p>The customer service department acts as a communication bridge between customers and other departments within the company. When a customer has an issue that requires specialized expertise—such as a technical problem needing engineering or IT support—the customer service team facilitates this connection to find a solution. This cross-functional coordination is essential for resolving complex issues that extend beyond what frontline support can handle directly.</p>
