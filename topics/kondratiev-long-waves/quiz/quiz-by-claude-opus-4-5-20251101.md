  <p>50 years, driven by technological innovations</p>
  <p>Kondratiev proposed that capitalist economies experience long-term cycles of approximately 50 years, characterized by alternating periods of growth and decline. These cycles are driven by major technological innovations—from steam power and railways to electricity, automobiles, and now computers and information technology. Understanding this framework helps technology professionals recognize how transformative technologies create new economic eras and anticipate the potential impact of emerging technologies like AI on the broader economy.</p>
