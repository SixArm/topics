  <p>An outcome that can only take on a specific set of distinct values, often representing categories or groups</p>
  <p>A discrete outcome (also called categorical or qualitative outcome) is limited to a specific set of distinct possibilities, such as coin toss results (heads/tails), survey response categories, or counts of items. Unlike continuous outcomes that can take any value within a range, discrete outcomes have separate, countable values that are typically analyzed using methods like chi-square tests or logistic regression.</p>
