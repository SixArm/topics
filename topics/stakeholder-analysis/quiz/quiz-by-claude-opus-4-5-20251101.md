  <p>To allocate resources and attention appropriately to manage relationships effectively</p>
  <p>Prioritizing stakeholders helps project managers and organizations focus their limited resources—including time, communication efforts, and engagement activities—on the stakeholders who have the greatest potential impact on the project. This enables more effective relationship management, better decision-making, and risk mitigation by ensuring high-influence stakeholders receive appropriate attention while still maintaining relationships with all relevant parties.</p>
