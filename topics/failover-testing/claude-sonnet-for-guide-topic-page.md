# Failover testing

Failover testing validates that systems can automatically switch to backup components, servers, or networks when primary systems fail, maintaining service availability with minimal disruption to end users.

Automated failover testing involves systematically simulating various failure scenarios to verify that redundant systems activate seamlessly. Test automation frameworks can trigger network outages, server crashes, database failures, and other critical system disruptions while monitoring response times, data integrity, and service recovery procedures.

The automation process typically includes pre-configured test scripts that execute failover scenarios during off-peak hours or in dedicated testing environments. AdvanTesting tools can simulate gradual system degradation, sudden hardware failures, and network partitioning while measuring key performance indicators such as recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives. Automated monitoring systems track system behavior throughout the failover process, generating detailed reports on switchover duration, data loss, and service restoration metrics.

Implementing automated failover testing requires careful planning to avoid disrupting production systems. Test environments should mirror production configurations as closely as possible, including network topology, load balancing configurations, and data replication settings. Regular automated testing schedules help identify potential weaknesses before they impact real users, while integration with continuous integration pipelines ensures that new code deployments don't compromise failover capabilities.
