# Failover testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of failover testing in system reliability?

- [ ] To measure system performance under normal operating conditions
- [ ] To validate that systems can automatically switch to backup components when primary systems fail
- [ ] To test user interface responsiveness across different devices
- [ ] To verify that software deployments complete without errors

  <p>To validate that systems can automatically switch to backup components when primary systems fail</p>
  <p>Failover testing ensures that when primary systems fail, backup components, servers, or networks automatically activate to maintain service availability with minimal disruption. This includes verifying recovery time objectives (RTO), recovery point objectives (RPO), data integrity, and seamless switchover procedures.</p>
