  <p>A critical point is reached causing significant non-linear change</p>
  <p>Threshold effects are characterized by a tipping point or critical threshold that, once crossed, leads to substantial and often non-linear consequences. This is seen in economies of scale, technology adoption reaching critical mass, and market penetration where crossing a threshold triggers accelerated outcomes rather than gradual, proportional changes.</p>
