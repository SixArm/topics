  <p>To serve as decision points where progress is evaluated against predefined criteria before advancing</p>
  <p>Gates are the critical decision points between stages where a cross-functional gatekeeping team evaluates the project's viability, alignment with strategic goals, risks, and resource requirements. Based on predefined criteria, gatekeepers decide whether to approve the project to proceed, request modifications, or terminate it—making gates essential for reducing risk and ensuring projects stay aligned with organizational priorities.</p>
