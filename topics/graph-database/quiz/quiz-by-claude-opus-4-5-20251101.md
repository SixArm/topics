# Graph database

Question: What distinguishes a graph database from other types of NoSQL databases in terms of data modeling?

- [ ] It stores data exclusively in key-value pairs for fast lookups
- [ ] It uses nodes and edges (relationships) as first-class citizens, where relationships have equal importance to the data itself
- [ ] It organizes data in wide-column stores optimized for write-heavy workloads
- [ ] It stores data as JSON documents with nested hierarchical structures

  <p>It uses nodes and edges (relationships) as first-class citizens, where relationships have equal importance to the data itself</p>
  <p>Graph databases uniquely model data as nodes connected by edges (relationships), where both can have properties. Unlike other database types, the relationships between data points are treated as equally important as the data itself. This structure enables powerful traversal queries—such as finding shortest paths or multi-hop connections—making graph databases ideal for applications involving complex interconnected data like social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.</p>
