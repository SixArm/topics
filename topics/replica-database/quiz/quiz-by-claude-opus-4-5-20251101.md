  <p>To improve data availability, accessibility, and reliability</p>
  <p>A replica database is a copy of a primary database kept in sync through continuous replication. Its main purpose is to improve data availability, accessibility, and reliability, especially in distributed systems where the primary database may be in a different geographical region or subject to downtime or failure. This enables organizations to achieve increased scalability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery capabilities.</p>
