  <p>The employee is not currently assigned to a project but is available for assignment</p>
  <p>"On the bench" refers to an employee who is not currently assigned to a specific project or task, but is available and waiting to be assigned to one. The term is derived from sports, where players not actively playing are said to be "on the bench." This situation can provide opportunities for skill development and training, while also giving organizations flexibility to respond to new projects or business opportunities.</p>
