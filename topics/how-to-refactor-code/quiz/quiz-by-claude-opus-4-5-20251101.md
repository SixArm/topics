  <p>To improve maintainability and quality without changing external behavior</p>
  <p>Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code to enhance its readability, maintainability, and design while preserving its external behavior. The key distinction is that refactoring improves internal code quality without altering what the code does from the user's perspective. This is why having tests in place before refactoring is essential—they verify that the code's behavior remains unchanged after modifications.</p>
