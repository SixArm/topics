# AI + agtech

Question: What is precision agriculture in the context of AI + agtech?

- [ ] Using AI-powered robots to autonomously plant and harvest crops
- [ ] Analyzing satellite imagery to detect pests and diseases in crops
- [ ] Using AI to optimize resource usage by determining optimal amounts of water, fertilizers, and pesticides for specific farmland areas
- [ ] Leveraging AI to predict crop yields based on weather and soil data

  <p>Using AI to optimize resource usage by determining optimal amounts of water, fertilizers, and pesticides for specific farmland areas</p>
  <p>Precision agriculture uses AI to analyze data and provide insights on the exact amounts of resources (water, fertilizers, pesticides) needed for specific areas of farmland, reducing waste and improving efficiency. This targeted approach differs from autonomous farming (robotic operations), pest detection (image analysis for threats), and yield prediction (forecasting harvests), though all are important AI + agtech applications.</p>
