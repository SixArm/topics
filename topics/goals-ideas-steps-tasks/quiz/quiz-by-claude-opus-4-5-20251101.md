  <p>Goals, Ideas, Steps, Tasks</p>
  <p>The GIST framework follows a logical progression: first establish clear Goals that provide direction and purpose, then generate Ideas through brainstorming to achieve those goals, then break down the ideas into actionable Steps, and finally define specific Tasks that need to be carried out to complete the steps. This sequence ensures work flows from high-level objectives down to concrete activities.</p>
