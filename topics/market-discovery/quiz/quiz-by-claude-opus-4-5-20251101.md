  <p>To understand the market landscape and determine whether a viable market opportunity exists</p>
  <p>Market discovery is fundamentally about identifying and evaluating the size, viability, and potential of a market before committing significant resources. This foundational understanding enables startups to make informed decisions about product development, positioning, and go-to-market strategy. Without validating that a viable market opportunity exists, other activities like pricing, marketing campaigns, or building sales teams would be premature.</p>
