# Agile contraindications

Question: Which of the following is a significant contraindication for adopting agile methodologies?

- [ ] Teams that have strong collaborative practices and self-organization
- [ ] Organizations with rigid regulatory requirements that mandate extensive documentation and strict change control

  <p>Organizations with rigid regulatory requirements that mandate extensive documentation and strict change control</p>
  <p>Agile methodologies emphasize flexibility, minimal documentation, and iterative development. Organizations in heavily regulated industries (such as medical devices or nuclear systems) often have mandatory documentation requirements and strict change control processes that directly conflict with agile's core principles, making agile adoption challenging or inappropriate in these contexts.</p>
