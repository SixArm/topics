# Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles

"Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 4.

Developing solutions incrementally in a series of short iterations allows for
faster customer feedback and mitigates risk. Subsequent increments build on the
previous ones. Since the ‘system always runs,’ some increments may serve as
prototypes for market testing and validation; others become minimum viable
products (MVPs). Still others extend the system with new and valuable
functionality. In addition, these early, fast feedback points help determine
when to ‘pivot’ where necessary to an alternate course of action.
