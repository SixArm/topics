# Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles

Question: What is a key benefit of building solutions incrementally with short iterations according to SAFe Principle 4?

- [ ] It eliminates the need for market testing entirely
- [ ] It allows for faster customer feedback and risk mitigation
- [ ] It guarantees that the first release will be the final product
- [ ] It removes the need to pivot or change direction

  <p>It allows for faster customer feedback and risk mitigation</p>
  <p>SAFe Principle 4 emphasizes that developing solutions incrementally in short iterations enables faster customer feedback and mitigates risk. Each increment builds on previous ones, and since "the system always runs," increments can serve as prototypes for market testing, minimum viable products (MVPs), or extensions with new functionality. This approach also helps teams identify when to pivot to an alternate course of action based on early, fast feedback points.</p>
