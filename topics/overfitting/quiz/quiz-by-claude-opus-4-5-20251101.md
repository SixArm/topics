# Overfitting

Question: What is the primary characteristic of an overfitted machine learning model?

- [ ] The model uses too few parameters to capture patterns in the data
- [ ] The model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data
- [ ] The model has equally high error on both training and test datasets
- [ ] The model fails to learn any meaningful patterns from the training data

  <p>The model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data</p>
  <p>Overfitting occurs when a model "memorizes" the training data rather than learning general patterns. This results in low training error but high test/validation error, because the model becomes too specific to the training data's noise and outliers and fails to generalize to new data.</p>
