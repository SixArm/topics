  <p>Misaligned goals and incompatible visions between partners</p>
  <p>When partners have different expectations or incompatible visions for the partnership, it leads to diverging interests and conflicting priorities. This fundamental misalignment undermines decision-making, resource allocation, and collaboration throughout the partnership. Without shared goals, partners pull in different directions, making it nearly impossible to achieve meaningful innovation outcomes together.</p>
