  <p>Manipulating symbols and rules to simulate human cognitive processes</p>
  <p>Symbolic AI focuses on the manipulation and processing of symbols and rules to simulate human cognitive processes. Knowledge is represented explicitly using symbols (which can represent objects, concepts, or relationships), and these symbols are manipulated using formal logic and reasoning systems to derive new knowledge or solve problems. This contrasts with machine learning approaches that learn from data rather than manipulating predefined symbols and rules.</p>
