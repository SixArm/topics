  <p>TAM is the largest, containing SAM, which contains SOM</p>
  <p>TAM (Total Addressable Market) represents the entire market demand for a product or service. SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market) is a subset of TAM that a business can realistically target based on its resources and capabilities. SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) is the smallest, representing the portion of SAM the business can realistically capture given competition and its sales/marketing efforts. Understanding this hierarchy helps technology professionals make informed decisions about market entry, resource allocation, and growth projections.</p>
