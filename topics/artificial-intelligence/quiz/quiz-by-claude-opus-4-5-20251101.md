  <p>To create machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence</p>
  <p>AI focuses on creating intelligent agents—systems that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve specific goals. This encompasses developing algorithms and programs that can learn and make decisions based on data, enabling machines to perform cognitive tasks like speech recognition, image interpretation, and decision-making that traditionally required human intelligence.</p>
