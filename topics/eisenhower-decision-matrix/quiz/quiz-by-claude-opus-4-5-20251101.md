  <p>Schedule them for dedicated time in your calendar</p>
  <p>In the Eisenhower Matrix, tasks that are Important but Not Urgent fall into Quadrant 2 and should be scheduled. These activities—such as skill development, strategic planning, and relationship building—contribute to long-term goals and career growth. Without deliberate scheduling, these valuable tasks often get pushed aside by urgent but less important work, leading to reactive rather than proactive time management.</p>
