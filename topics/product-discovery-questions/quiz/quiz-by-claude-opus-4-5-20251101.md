  <p>To ensure the product addresses genuine customer needs and pain points</p>
  <p>The core problem question is foundational to product discovery because it validates that the product has a clear purpose tied to real customer needs. Without understanding the problem being solved and how it addresses customer pain points, teams risk building products that lack product-market fit. This question should be answered before moving on to features, pricing, or marketing strategies.</p>
