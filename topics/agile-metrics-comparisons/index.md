# Agile metrics comparisons

Agile metrics and related metrics can give you multiple perspectives on what's happening.

* **Agile metrics**: focus on value value e.g. customer satisfaction, team morale, feature adoption and engagement. Use for long-term Agile success. Examples: Net Promoter Score; Devaux's Index of Project Performance.

* **Delivery metrics**: focus on shipping e.g. time to market, delivery rate, release speed. Use for optimizing delivery times. Examples: time from concept to release; topic launch success rate.

* **Kanban metrics**: focus on tasks e.g. flow efficiency, cycle time distribution, queue length. Use for continuous flow projects balancing workloads. Examples: time spent in work stages; number of tasks per stage.

* **Lean metrics**: Focus on value stream efficiency e.g. cycle time, lead time, work in progress, throughput. Use for optimizing processes by removing waste. Examples: time it takes for a task to go from request to delivery; active tasks per stage.

* **Scrum metrics**: focus on sprint points e.g. velocity, burndown/burnup, cumulative flow diagram. Use for time-boxed iterations with work planning. Examples: completed story points per sprint; Work remaining in a sprint.
