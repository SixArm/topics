  <p>Lean metrics</p>
  <p>Lean metrics specifically focus on value stream efficiency, measuring cycle time, lead time, work in progress, and throughput. Their primary purpose is to optimize processes by identifying and removing waste. This distinguishes them from Scrum metrics (which focus on sprint points and velocity), Kanban metrics (which focus on flow efficiency and queue management), and Delivery metrics (which focus on shipping speed and time to market).</p>
