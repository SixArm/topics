# Agile Metrics Comparisons: Tutorial

## Overview

Different methodologies and frameworks use different metrics to measure success. Understanding the distinctions between agile metrics, delivery metrics, Kanban metrics, Lean metrics, and Scrum metrics helps teams choose the right measurements for their context.

## The Five Metric Categories

### Agile Metrics

**Focus**: Value delivery—customer satisfaction, team morale, feature adoption and engagement

**Use when**: You want to measure long-term agile success and whether your team is delivering meaningful outcomes

**Examples**:
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- Devaux's Index of Project Performance (DIPP)
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Team engagement surveys

**Key insight**: Agile metrics look beyond the development process to measure whether the organization is achieving its goals through agile practices.

### Delivery Metrics

**Focus**: Shipping—time to market, delivery rate, release speed

**Use when**: You want to optimize how quickly value reaches users

**Examples**:
- Time from concept to release
- Product launch success rate
- Release cadence
- Feature lead time

**Key insight**: Delivery metrics measure the efficiency of the pipeline from idea to user, regardless of the specific methodology used.

### Kanban Metrics

**Focus**: Tasks—flow efficiency, cycle time distribution, queue length

**Use when**: You are running a continuous flow process and need to balance workloads

**Examples**:
- Time spent in each work stage (waiting, in progress, review, done)
- Number of tasks per stage (work in progress limits)
- Throughput (items completed per time period)
- Blocked item count and duration

**Key insight**: Kanban metrics are about optimizing flow. They help identify where work gets stuck and where the process can be smoothed.

### Lean Metrics

**Focus**: Value stream efficiency—cycle time, lead time, work in progress, throughput

**Use when**: You want to optimize processes by removing waste

**Examples**:
- End-to-end lead time (request to delivery)
- Active tasks per stage
- Process efficiency ratio (value-added time vs. total time)
- Waste identification metrics

**Key insight**: Lean metrics focus on the entire value stream, identifying waste—activities that consume resources without adding value.

### Scrum Metrics

**Focus**: Sprint performance—velocity, burndown/burnup, cumulative flow

**Use when**: You are working in time-boxed iterations and need to plan and track sprint work

**Examples**:
- Completed story points per sprint (velocity)
- Work remaining in a sprint (burndown)
- Sprint goal completion rate
- Scope change during sprints

**Key insight**: Scrum metrics are tied to the sprint cadence and are primarily used for planning and tracking within the Scrum framework.

## Choosing the Right Metrics

### Match Metrics to Your Methodology

If your team uses Scrum, start with Scrum metrics. If you use Kanban, start with Kanban metrics. Mixing metrics from different frameworks without understanding their context can lead to confusion.

### Layer Metrics for a Complete Picture

No single category provides a complete view. Most mature teams use a combination:

- **Scrum or Kanban metrics** for day-to-day process management
- **Delivery metrics** for measuring pipeline efficiency
- **Agile metrics** for measuring overall organizational effectiveness
- **Lean metrics** for identifying and eliminating waste

### Avoid Metric Overload

It is better to track a few metrics well than many metrics poorly. Start with two or three and add more only when the team needs additional insight.

## Practical Steps

1. **Identify your primary methodology**: This determines your starting set of metrics.
2. **Add one metric from each relevant category**: Build a balanced dashboard that covers process, delivery, and value.
3. **Review monthly**: Assess whether your metrics are providing actionable insight or just noise.
4. **Compare trends across categories**: For example, if Scrum velocity is stable but delivery lead time is increasing, the bottleneck is outside the sprint process.
5. **Educate the team**: Ensure everyone understands what each metric measures and why it matters.

## Key Takeaway

Different metric categories answer different questions. Agile metrics ask "Are we delivering value?" Delivery metrics ask "How fast are we shipping?" Kanban and Lean metrics ask "Is our process flowing efficiently?" Scrum metrics ask "How is our sprint performing?" Use the right metrics for the questions you need to answer.
