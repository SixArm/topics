  <p>To ensure that goals, objectives, and activities across the organization are coordinated to support the overall strategic direction</p>
  <p>Strategic alignment is fundamentally about synchronizing different elements of an organization—business units, departments, teams, projects, processes, and resources—so they work together toward a common purpose. When achieved, it improves efficiency, enhances coordination, enables better resource allocation, and increases organizational agility in responding to external changes.</p>
