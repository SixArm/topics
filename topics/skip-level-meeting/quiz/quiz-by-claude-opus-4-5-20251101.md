  <p>To create open communication between higher-level management and employees who are not their direct reports</p>
  <p>A skip-level meeting is designed to create an open and transparent communication channel between higher-level management and lower-level employees (skipping one level in the chain of command). This helps build trust, increase employee engagement, and provides leaders with valuable insights into front-line challenges and ideas for improvement.</p>
