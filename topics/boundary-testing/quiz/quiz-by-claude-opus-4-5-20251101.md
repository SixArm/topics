# Boundary testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of boundary testing in software quality assurance?

- [ ] To test the visual appearance of user interface components
- [ ] To measure the performance and response time of applications under load
- [ ] To evaluate application behavior at the edges of input domains and operational limits
- [ ] To verify that database transactions are properly committed

  <p>To evaluate application behavior at the edges of input domains and operational limits</p>
  <p>Boundary testing focuses on testing values at boundaries, just above them, and just below them (such as 17, 18, 19, 64, 65, 66 for an 18-65 age range). This approach is highly effective because many software defects—including off-by-one errors, buffer overflows, and improper input validation—commonly occur at these transition points due to programming errors in conditional statements, loop boundaries, and array indexing.</p>
