# Boundary testing

Boundary testing focuses on evaluating the behavior of applications at the edges of input domains and operational limits. This examines values at boundaries, just above boundaries, and just below boundaries to identify potential defects that commonly occur at these transition points.

In automated boundary testing, test cases are designed to input values at minimum and maximum acceptable ranges, as well as values that fall just outside these ranges. For example, if a system accepts ages between 18 and 65, boundary tests would include values like 17, 18, 19, 64, 65, and 66. This approach is particularly effective because many software defects manifest at these edge conditions due to programming errors in conditional statements, loop boundaries, and array indexing.

Automation tools excel at boundary testing by systematically generating and executing large volumes of test cases across multiple boundary conditions simultaneously. These tools can efficiently test numeric ranges, string lengths, file sizes, database record limits, and system resource boundaries.

The effectiveness of automated boundary testing lies in its ability to uncover common programming mistakes such as off-by-one errors, buffer overflows, and improper input validation. Modern automation frameworks integrate boundary testing into continuous integration pipelines, ensuring that boundary conditions are validated with every code change. This systematic approach significantly reduces the risk of boundary-related defects reaching production environments while maintaining comprehensive test coverage across all system interfaces and operational limits.
