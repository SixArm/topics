  <p>Making decisions that consider the impact on the next seven generations</p>
  <p>The Seventh Generation Principle, rooted in Indigenous American culture, encourages decision-makers to consider the long-term environmental, social, and economic consequences of their actions on future generations—specifically the next seven generations. For technology professionals, this means designing sustainable systems, considering the full lifecycle of products, and making choices that support responsible resource management rather than focusing solely on short-term gains.</p>
