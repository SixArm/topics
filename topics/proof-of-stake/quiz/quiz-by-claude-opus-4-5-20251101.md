# Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

Question: What is the primary mechanism by which validators are selected to create new blocks in a Proof-of-Stake blockchain network?

- [ ] By solving complex mathematical puzzles faster than other nodes
- [ ] Based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and stake in the network
- [ ] Through a round-robin scheduling algorithm among all network participants
- [ ] By having the most powerful hardware and computing resources

  <p>Based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and stake in the network</p>
  <p>In Proof-of-Stake, validators are chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and "stake" in the network. This is fundamentally different from Proof-of-Work, which requires solving computational puzzles. Validators are incentivized to act honestly because they risk losing their staked cryptocurrency if they validate fraudulent transactions or behave maliciously.</p>
