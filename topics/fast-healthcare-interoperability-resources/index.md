# Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR, pronounced "fire") is a standards framework for exchanging electronic health records (EHR). It utilizes modern web technologies, specifically RESTful APIs, JSON, XML, or RDF, to allow healthcare information systems to share data easily and securely.

- Purpose: Enables, standardizes, and streamlines the exchange of healthcare information, making it readable and usable across different systems.
- Resources: Data is structured into modular components called "resources" (e.g., Patient, Observation, Medication), which are standardized building blocks.
- API-First Approach: Uses HTTP-based RESTful protocols, facilitating, reading, creating, updating, and deleting patient data in real-time.
- Flexibility: Designed to support a wide range of use cases—from mobile apps to cloud-based EHRs—and can be extended for specific organizational needs.
- Interoperability: Facilitates improved data sharing, reducing the burden on clinicians and supporting care coordination.
- FHIR is widely adopted as the standard for health data exchange, particularly with the release of FHIR R4, which is commonly used for regulatory compliance.
