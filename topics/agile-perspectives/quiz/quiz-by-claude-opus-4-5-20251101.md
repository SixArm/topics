  <p>To provide diverse viewpoints that help teams better understand complexity and deliver customer value</p>
  <p>Agile perspectives offer a wide range of viewpoints—from customer-focused approaches (Voice of Customer) to collaboration frameworks (The Three Amigos) to complexity assessment tools (The Stacey Matrix). Together, these perspectives help teams adapt their approach based on context, understand different dimensions of product development, and ultimately deliver solutions that meet customer needs. The value lies in having multiple lenses through which to view problems rather than adhering to a single rigid methodology.</p>
