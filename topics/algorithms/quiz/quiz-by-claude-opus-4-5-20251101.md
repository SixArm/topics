# Algorithms

Question: What is the primary purpose of analyzing an algorithm's time complexity and space complexity?

- [ ] To determine which programming language should be used
- [ ] To measure how long an algorithm takes to run and how much memory it requires
- [ ] To identify which category of algorithm is being used
- [ ] To convert the algorithm into machine code

  <p>To measure how long an algorithm takes to run and how much memory it requires</p>
  <p>Time complexity measures the computational time an algorithm takes as a function of input size, while space complexity measures the memory usage. Understanding both is essential for technology professionals to evaluate algorithm efficiency, predict performance at scale, and make informed decisions when choosing or optimizing algorithms for real-world applications.</p>
