# Graph data structure

Question: What distinguishes a directed graph from an undirected graph?

- [ ] Directed graphs must have weighted edges while undirected graphs cannot
- [ ] Directed graphs can only represent social networks while undirected graphs represent road networks
- [ ] Edges in a directed graph have a one-way relationship, while edges in an undirected graph represent two-way relationships
- [ ] Directed graphs have nodes and undirected graphs only have edges

  <p>Edges in a directed graph have a one-way relationship, while edges in an undirected graph represent two-way relationships</p>
  <p>In a directed graph, edges have a direction and represent a one-way relationship (e.g., a "follows" relationship in social media where one person follows another but not vice versa). In an undirected graph, edges do not have a direction and represent two-way relationships (e.g., a road connecting two cities that can be traveled in both directions). This distinction is fundamental to graph theory and determines which algorithms and operations are appropriate for a given problem.</p>
