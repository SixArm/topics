  <p>Overseeing overall operations and performance of a business or organizational unit</p>
  <p>A General Manager is a senior-level executive with broad authority across multiple business functions. Unlike specialized roles that focus on single departments, a GM provides leadership across strategic planning, financial management, operations, team leadership, stakeholder management, and business development. This comprehensive oversight enables them to make strategic decisions, manage resources holistically, and drive business growth while ensuring compliance and managing organizational risks.</p>
