- **Compliance oversight**: Ensuring adherence to relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards
- **Risk reporting**: Communicating risk posture to the board of directors and executive team
- **Crisis management**: Leading organizational response when risks materialize
- **Risk culture development**: Fostering risk awareness throughout the organization

## Reporting Structure and Governance

The CRO typically reports to the CEO and maintains a direct line to the board of directors, often through a risk committee. This dual reporting ensures:

- Independence from business units that might downplay risks
- Direct access to decision-makers for urgent risk matters

## Why Technology Professionals Should Understand the CRO Role

Understanding the CRO function helps technology professionals:

- Frame technical recommendations in risk terms that resonate with leadership
- Anticipate compliance requirements early in system design
