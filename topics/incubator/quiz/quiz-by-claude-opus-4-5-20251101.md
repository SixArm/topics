  <p>Incubators focus on long-term development support, while accelerators provide short-term intensive programs</p>
  <p>While incubators focus on providing resources and support to help startups develop and grow over time, accelerators focus on accelerating growth through short-term, intensive programs of mentorship and resources. Additionally, accelerators often provide funding in exchange for equity, while incubators typically do not take equity in the startups they support.</p>
