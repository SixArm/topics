# Private equity (PE)

Private equity (PE) is a form of alternative investment in which funds and investors acquire ownership stakes in private companies, or buy out public companies to delist them from stock exchanges. Unlike public market investments, PE involves direct capital deployment into businesses with the aim of driving growth, restructuring operations, improving profitability, and ultimately generating returns through a future exit event. For technology professionals, understanding PE is essential because PE-backed firms are major acquirers of technology companies, significant funders of digital transformation initiatives, and increasingly active investors across the entire technology landscape.

## How Private Equity Works

Private equity firms raise capital from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, pooling these funds into a dedicated investment vehicle known as a PE fund. The firm's general partners (GPs) manage the fund and make investment decisions, while the limited partners (LPs) — such as pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices — provide the majority of the capital. The GP typically contributes a smaller share of capital but earns management fees (usually around 2% of assets under management) and carried interest (typically 20% of profits above a hurdle rate). Investments are held for five to seven years on average before the firm seeks an exit, most commonly through a sale to another company, a secondary buyout, or an initial public offering (IPO).

## Investment Strategies

PE firms pursue different strategies depending on the maturity, risk profile, and capital requirements of target companies. Each strategy has distinct characteristics relevant to technology professionals.

| Strategy | Target Stage | Typical Deal Size | Technology Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Venture Capital | Early-stage, pre-revenue or early-revenue startups | $500K – $50M | Funds disruptive tech startups, SaaS platforms, deep tech |
| Growth Equity | Profitable, scaling companies with proven models | $25M – $500M | Backs expansion of established tech firms, product line growth |
| Buyout / Leveraged Buyout | Mature companies, often underperforming | $100M – $10B+ | Acquires legacy software firms, IT services, and infrastructure companies |
| Distressed / Turnaround | Companies in financial difficulty | Varies widely | Restructures struggling tech firms, acquires assets at discount |

## The PE Deal Lifecycle

A typical private equity investment follows a structured lifecycle from sourcing through exit:

- **Sourcing and origination.** The PE firm identifies potential investment targets through proprietary deal flow, investment banks, industry contacts, and market research.
- **Due diligence.** The firm conducts rigorous financial, operational, legal, and technical due diligence. For technology targets, this includes code audits, architecture reviews, IP assessments, cybersecurity posture, and technical debt evaluation.
- **Deal structuring and closing.** The transaction is structured, often involving a combination of equity and debt financing. Legal agreements, management incentive plans, and governance frameworks are established.
- **Value creation.** Post-acquisition, the PE firm works actively with management to execute a value creation plan. This may involve digital transformation, platform consolidation, talent upgrades, go-to-market optimization, and operational efficiencies.
- **Exit.** After the holding period, the firm realizes returns through an IPO, a strategic sale to another company, or a secondary sale to another PE firm.

## PE in the Technology Sector

Private equity has become one of the largest sources of capital in the technology industry. Several trends drive this activity:

- **Software and SaaS acquisitions.** PE firms favor software companies because of their recurring revenue models, high margins, and scalability. Firms like Thoma Bravo, Vista Equity Partners, and Silver Lake have built large portfolios of enterprise software businesses.
- **Take-private transactions.** Publicly traded technology companies that are undervalued or facing short-term market pressures are increasingly taken private by PE firms, giving them time and resources to execute long-term strategies without quarterly earnings scrutiny.
- **Platform and roll-up strategies.** PE firms acquire a platform company and then make add-on acquisitions to consolidate a fragmented market, a strategy commonly applied in IT services, managed services, and vertical SaaS segments.
- **Digital transformation of portfolio companies.** PE firms invest heavily in modernizing the technology stacks of their portfolio companies across all industries, creating demand for cloud migration, data analytics, automation, and cybersecurity expertise.

## Advantages and Risks

Private equity offers distinct benefits but also carries significant risks that technology professionals and entrepreneurs should understand.

**Advantages:**

- Access to substantial capital for growth, acquisitions, and R&D investment
- Operational expertise and strategic guidance from experienced investors
- Longer investment horizons compared to public markets, allowing for multi-year transformation plans
- Strong alignment of incentives through management equity participation and performance-based compensation
- Network effects from the PE firm's portfolio of companies and industry relationships

**Risks:**

- High leverage (debt) used in buyouts can strain cash flow and limit flexibility
- Pressure to cut costs may lead to reductions in engineering teams, R&D budgets, or product quality
- Loss of autonomy for founders and management teams under PE ownership
- Misalignment between short-to-medium-term financial targets and long-term technology investments
- Integration challenges when executing roll-up strategies across multiple acquisitions

## Key Metrics and Valuation

PE firms evaluate technology investments using a combination of financial and operational metrics. Understanding these metrics is critical for technology leaders who may be involved in due diligence, reporting, or exit preparation.

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| Revenue multiple (EV/Revenue) | Enterprise value divided by annual revenue; common for high-growth tech companies |
| EBITDA multiple (EV/EBITDA) | Enterprise value divided by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization; standard for mature businesses |
| Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) | Total annualized subscription or contract revenue; key SaaS metric |
| Net Revenue Retention (NRR) | Measures expansion and churn within existing customers; above 120% is considered strong |
| Rule of 40 | Revenue growth rate plus profit margin should exceed 40%; balances growth against profitability |
| Internal Rate of Return (IRR) | Annualized return on invested capital over the holding period; PE firms typically target 20%+ |
| Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC) | Total value returned divided by capital invested; a 3x MOIC means tripling the original investment |

## Impact on Technology Teams

When a PE firm acquires a technology company, the effects on engineering and product teams can be significant:

- **Operational rigor.** PE firms introduce formal KPIs, reporting cadences, and accountability frameworks that may be unfamiliar to teams accustomed to startup culture.
- **Cost optimization.** There is typically pressure to improve margins, which can mean consolidating tools, renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing headcount, or offshoring certain functions.
- **Technical debt prioritization.** PE-backed companies often must address technical debt strategically, balancing the need for platform stability against the cost of modernization.
- **M&A integration.** Engineers frequently face the challenge of integrating acquired products and platforms, harmonizing data models, APIs, and infrastructure across merged entities.
- **Career opportunities.** PE ownership can also create opportunities, including leadership roles in newly acquired portfolio companies, equity participation through management incentive plans, and exposure to a broader network of companies and executives.

## Summary

Private equity is a powerful force in the technology industry, channeling large pools of capital into software companies, IT services firms, and digital infrastructure businesses. PE firms acquire companies, apply operational and financial discipline, and seek to generate outsized returns over a multi-year holding period. For technology professionals, PE literacy matters because it shapes hiring decisions, product roadmaps, technical debt strategies, and organizational culture at PE-backed companies. Whether you are an engineer at an acquisition target, a founder evaluating a buyout offer, or a technology leader reporting to PE-backed board members, understanding how private equity works — its strategies, metrics, lifecycle, and impact — equips you to navigate these high-stakes environments effectively.
