  <p>Adopting open standards and open source solutions that allow for greater flexibility and interoperability</p>
  <p>Open standards and open source solutions reduce dependency on any single vendor by enabling interoperability with other vendors' products. This approach gives organizations the flexibility to switch vendors when needed without facing prohibitive switching costs related to proprietary file formats, specialized hardware, or lack of compatibility.</p>
