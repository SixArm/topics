  <p>Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)</p>
  <p>TPUs are specialized processors developed by Google specifically for accelerating machine learning tasks. They are optimized for matrix operations, which are fundamental to neural network computations, and provide high-performance, energy-efficient solutions for training and inference in deep learning models. While GPUs can also perform parallel computations for machine learning, TPUs are purpose-built for these workloads.</p>
