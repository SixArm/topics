# Agile vs Six Sigma

Question: What is the fundamental difference between Agile and Six Sigma in their approach to change during software development?

- [ ] Both methodologies embrace change equally but differ only in documentation requirements
- [ ] Six Sigma encourages frequent changes through statistical analysis while Agile minimizes variation
- [ ] Agile embraces change as inevitable and valuable, while Six Sigma seeks to minimize variation through standardized processes
- [ ] Agile requires longer timelines for change analysis while Six Sigma uses short sprints

  <p>Agile embraces change as inevitable and valuable, while Six Sigma seeks to minimize variation through standardized processes</p>
  <p>This represents the core philosophical difference between the two methodologies. Agile is designed to respond to change quickly through short iterations and continuous customer feedback, treating changing requirements as opportunities. Six Sigma, rooted in manufacturing principles, focuses on eliminating variations and defects through rigorous statistical analysis and standardized processes using frameworks like DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control).</p>
