  <p>Customers sharing positive experiences through word-of-mouth and social sharing</p>
  <p>Viral effects occur when customers become advocates for a product or service and share their positive experiences with others, creating a self-sustaining cycle of growth and adoption. This organic spread through social sharing—similar to how a virus spreads—is what distinguishes viral effects from traditional marketing approaches like paid advertising.</p>
