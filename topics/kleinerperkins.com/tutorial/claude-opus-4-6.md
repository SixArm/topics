## History and Founding

Eugene Kleiner, a former engineer at Fairchild Semiconductor, and Tom Perkins, a Hewlett-Packard executive, established Kleiner Perkins on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park. Their backgrounds combined deep engineering expertise with business acumen, setting the tone for the firm's hands-on investment philosophy. Kleiner was one of the original "Traitorous Eight" who left Shockley Semiconductor to found Fairchild, making him a foundational figure in the semiconductor industry. Perkins brought operational leadership experience and a keen eye for market timing. The firm's early focus on technology and life sciences positioned it at the epicenter of the emerging venture capital ecosystem in the San Francisco Bay Area.

## Investment Philosophy

Kleiner Perkins distinguishes itself through a founder-centric investment model. Rather than acting as passive capital providers, the firm's partners work closely with portfolio companies, offering strategic guidance, operational support, and access to a broad network of industry experts and entrepreneurs.
