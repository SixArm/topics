# Data mesh

Question: What is the core architectural principle that distinguishes data mesh from traditional centralized data platforms?

- [ ] Consolidating all data into a single data warehouse managed by a central IT team
- [ ] Using a single schema across the entire organization for consistency
- [ ] Treating data as a product with decentralized ownership organized by business domains
- [ ] Implementing real-time streaming for all data pipelines

  <p>Treating data as a product with decentralized ownership organized by business domains</p>
  <p>Data mesh fundamentally shifts from monolithic, centralized data architectures to a decentralized model where data is organized into "domains" that align with business areas. Each domain manages its own data as a product, with Domain Owners responsible for quality, governance, and delivery. This approach treats data as a first-class product with clear ownership, enabling better scalability and allowing teams closest to the data to manage it effectively through a self-serve platform.</p>
