  <p>The lifespan of an object or component in a system</p>
  <p>A lifeline is a fundamental element in sequence diagrams, represented as a vertical line extending from the top of an object rectangle. It shows the existence of an object over time during the interaction being modeled, allowing you to visualize when messages are sent and received throughout the object's participation in the sequence.</p>
