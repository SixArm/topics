# Net Present Value (NPV)

Question: What does a positive Net Present Value (NPV) indicate about an investment decision?

- [ ] The investment's cash flows are uncertain and require further analysis
- [ ] The investment is expected to be profitable and should be pursued
- [ ] The discount rate used was too high for accurate calculation
- [ ] The initial investment amount equals the future cash flows

  <p>The investment is expected to be profitable and should be pursued</p>
  <p>A positive NPV means that the present value of expected future cash inflows exceeds the present value of cash outflows (including the initial investment), indicating the investment will generate value above the required return rate. This is the fundamental decision rule in NPV analysis: accept projects with positive NPV, reject those with negative NPV.</p>
