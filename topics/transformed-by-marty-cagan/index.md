# Transformed: Moving to the Product Operating Model

"Transformed: Moving to the Product Operating Model" by Marty Cagan helps
companies bridge the gap from traditional delivery models to product‑centered
organizations.

**Product Operating Model vs. IT/Project Model:** Cagan differentiates the
outdated “IT model” where business dictates feature deliverables and dates,
from the “product operating model” where cross‑functional teams are empowered
to identify and solve real customer problems.

**Principles Over Prescription:** Rather than one-size-fits-all templates, use
first principles—like continuous discovery, outcome-focused roadmaps, empowered
engineering teams, and insight-driven strategy—for organizations to adapt within
their context.

**High‑Integrity Commitment:s** Rather than arbitrary deadline-driven delivery,
when a date really matters, only the product team—not business or leadership—can
commit to it, after sufficient discovery and risk mitigation,

**Leadership as Coaches:** Executive and senior product leaders must do far more
than direct—they must coach. Cagan argues that up to 80% of a leader’s time
should be invested in coaching teams to think in product mindset, not feature
factory mindset.

**Transformation Strategy & Objection Handling:** Assess readiness, partner with
roles like CFO and sales, and manage resistance. Real-world objections are
addressed explicitly—such as resistance from team, success, or leadership
perspectives.

**Case Studies & Real Voices:** Includes first-person transformation stories
from organizations of different sizes and across industries. These detailed
profiles bring nuance—highlighting where change worked and where struggles
persisted.
