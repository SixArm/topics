  <p>80%</p>
  <p>Cagan argues that executive and senior product leaders must do far more than direct—they must coach. He specifically states that up to 80% of a leader's time should be invested in coaching teams to think in a product mindset, helping them move away from the feature factory approach where teams simply deliver prescribed features without understanding customer problems.</p>
