  <p>High-Context versus Low-Context Communication</p>
  <p>High-context communication relies on contextual information, nonverbal cues, shared assumptions, and cultural understanding to convey meaning, while low-context communication depends on explicit verbal statements. This distinction is critical for technology professionals working in global teams, as misunderstanding this dimension can lead to misinterpretations—for example, a low-context communicator may miss important unspoken expectations from a high-context colleague, or a high-context communicator may find explicit instructions unnecessarily blunt.</p>
