  <p>Any technology demo will eventually fail if demonstrated often enough</p>
  <p>The Law of Demos, formulated by Mitch Kapor in 1983, states that demos are controlled environments that showcase best features while glossing over flaws. The more a demo is shown, the more likely its limitations become apparent, potentially leading to audience skepticism. The solution is to be transparent about limitations upfront to build trust.</p>
