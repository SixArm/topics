  <p>Maintaining strong discipline around work-in-progress limits and clear definition of done criteria</p>
  <p>Sprint-less agile (continuous flow or Kanban-style development) requires teams to establish alternative mechanisms for maintaining focus and quality. Work-in-progress limits prevent overload and ensure flow, while clear definition of done criteria maintain quality standards. Without the natural boundaries that sprints provide, these disciplines become critical for preventing chaos and ensuring continuous delivery of value.</p>
