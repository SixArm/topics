# Agile + financial sector

The financial sector has increasingly embraced agile software engineering methodologies to accelerate digital transformation and improve customer experiences. Traditional banks and financial institutions, historically known for rigid waterfall approaches, now recognize agile's value.

JPMorgan Chase exemplifies this transformation, implementing agile practices across its technology teams to develop mobile banking applications and trading platforms. The bank adopted cross-functional teams, daily standups, and iterative development cycles, reducing time-to-market for new features from months to weeks.

Capital One has built its entire technology organization around agile principles, using continuous integration and deployment to rapidly iterate on their credit card and banking applications.

Financial technology companies like Stripe and Square have demonstrated agile's effectiveness in payment processing and merchant services. These companies use agile methodologies to rapidly develop APIs, integrate with new payment methods, and scale their platforms globally while maintaining high security standards.

Allstate insurance has adopted agile practices for developing mobile apps and customer portals, to improve claim processing systems and enhance customer self-service capabilities.

ING Bank represents one of the most dramatic agile transformations in banking, completely restructuring their organization into autonomous, multidisciplinary squads similar to Spotify's model. This approach enabled them to accelerate product development and respond more quickly to market changes. The bank eliminated traditional hierarchies in favor of tribes and chapters, fostering innovation and collaboration.
