  <p>To ensure stock option strike prices are not below fair market value, avoiding adverse tax consequences</p>
  <p>A 409A valuation determines the fair market value of a private company's common stock to ensure that employees receiving stock options are not granted a strike price below fair market value. If the strike price is too low, the IRS could consider it a form of compensation, resulting in significant tax consequences for both the company and employees.</p>
