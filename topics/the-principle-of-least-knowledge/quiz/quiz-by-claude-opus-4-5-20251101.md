# The Principle of Least Knowledge

Question: What is the primary benefit of following the Principle of Least Knowledge (Law of Demeter) in software design?

- [ ] It allows objects to access any method in the system for maximum flexibility
- [ ] It reduces coupling between modules, improving maintainability and scalability
- [ ] It increases the number of direct connections between objects for faster communication
- [ ] It eliminates the need for abstraction and encapsulation in object-oriented design

  <p>It reduces coupling between modules, improving maintainability and scalability</p>
  <p>The Principle of Least Knowledge states that an object should only communicate with its immediate neighbors, not with objects further away in the system. By limiting what an object knows about other objects, the principle reduces coupling between modules. This makes the system easier to maintain because changes to one module are less likely to impact other modules, and it improves scalability by promoting a more modular architecture.</p>
