# Values statement examples

A values statement is a formal declaration that articulates the core principles and beliefs guiding an organization's culture, decisions, and behavior. Unlike a mission statement, which describes what an organization does, or a vision statement, which describes where it aspires to go, a values statement defines how the organization operates and what it stands for at a fundamental level. For technology professionals, understanding values statements is critical because they shape engineering culture, hiring practices, product ethics, and strategic priorities. Examining real-world examples reveals patterns in how leading companies translate abstract ideals into actionable commitments.

## Why values statements matter in technology

Technology companies wield outsized influence on society through the products and platforms they build. A well-crafted values statement serves as a decision-making compass when teams face trade-offs between speed and quality, profit and privacy, growth and sustainability. It also functions as a recruiting filter, attracting candidates who share the organization's priorities and repelling those who do not. In fast-moving industries where ambiguity is constant, values statements provide the stable reference point that policies and procedures alone cannot.

Organizations with clearly articulated values tend to demonstrate stronger employee engagement, more consistent brand identity, and greater resilience during crises. When a data breach occurs or a product decision draws public scrutiny, the values statement becomes the framework through which leadership communicates accountability and charts a path forward.

## Notable values statement examples

The following examples illustrate how different organizations express their core principles:

**Starbucks**: "Creating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome." This statement centers inclusivity and psychological safety, signaling that the customer and employee experience matters as much as the product itself.

**Ben & Jerry's**: "We're committed to making ice cream in the most socially responsible way we can." This statement ties product creation directly to social impact, making responsibility inseparable from the business model.

**Airbnb**: "Be a host, not a landlord." This concise statement reframes the company's marketplace around hospitality and human connection rather than transactional property rental.

**Patagonia**: "Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis." This multi-part statement balances product excellence with environmental stewardship and positions the company as an activist organization.

**Google**: "Focus on the user and all else will follow." This statement establishes user-centricity as the foundational principle from which all product and business decisions flow.

**The Body Shop**: "Dedicate our business to the pursuit of social and environmental change." This statement subordinates commercial activity to a broader social mission, defining the company as a vehicle for change.

## Comparing values statement approaches

| Company | Primary Theme | Scope | Tone |
|---|---|---|---|
| Starbucks | Inclusion and belonging | Internal culture and customer experience | Warm and inviting |
| Ben & Jerry's | Social responsibility | Product creation and societal impact | Mission-driven |
| Airbnb | Community and hospitality | Customer and host relationships | Direct and conversational |
| Patagonia | Environmental stewardship | Product, operations, and advocacy | Activist and urgent |
| Google | User-centricity | Product development and innovation | Confident and aspirational |
| The Body Shop | Social and environmental change | Entire business purpose | Bold and declarative |

## Patterns and characteristics of effective values statements

Studying these examples reveals several recurring traits that distinguish strong values statements from generic ones:

- **Specificity over abstraction.** The most compelling statements avoid vague language like "excellence" or "integrity" in isolation. Instead, they anchor values to concrete domains such as environmental impact, user experience, or community building.
- **Brevity and memorability.** Airbnb's five-word statement and Google's single sentence demonstrate that shorter statements are easier to internalize and repeat across an organization.
- **Action orientation.** Effective values statements use active verbs: build, create, dedicate, focus. They describe behaviors rather than aspirations.
- **Differentiation.** A strong values statement could not belong to any company. Patagonia's reference to the environmental crisis and Ben & Jerry's mention of ice cream tie values to the specific identity of the organization.
- **Stakeholder breadth.** The best statements address multiple constituencies, including employees, customers, communities, and the planet, rather than focusing narrowly on shareholders.

## How to craft a values statement for a technology organization

Technology professionals tasked with defining or refining organizational values should consider the following dimensions:

- **Identify non-negotiables.** Determine which principles the organization would uphold even at significant financial cost. These are true values rather than preferences.
- **Consult broadly.** Gather input from engineering, design, product, operations, and leadership to ensure the statement reflects lived culture, not just executive aspiration.
- **Test for falsifiability.** A values statement that no reasonable organization would disagree with ("We value quality") adds no signal. Effective values imply a trade-off the organization is willing to make.
- **Align with decisions.** Review recent strategic decisions and ask whether the proposed values statement would have guided or contradicted those choices. Misalignment indicates that the statement needs revision or the decisions do.
- **Revisit regularly.** Values statements are living documents. As organizations grow, enter new markets, or face new ethical challenges, the statement should evolve to remain authentic.

## Related

Technology professionals exploring values statements should also study mission statements and vision statements to understand how the three work together as a strategic communication framework. Organizational culture, corporate social responsibility, and business ethics provide broader context for why values matter. Those interested in implementation should examine objectives and key results (OKRs) and leadership values as mechanisms for translating stated values into measurable action. Change management and stakeholder management are also closely connected, as values statements play a central role in guiding organizational transitions and building trust with diverse audiences.

## Summary

Values statements define the principles that govern how an organization operates, makes decisions, and relates to its stakeholders. The examples from Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's, Airbnb, Patagonia, Google, and The Body Shop illustrate that the most effective statements are specific, concise, action-oriented, and authentically tied to the organization's identity. For technology professionals, a well-crafted values statement is more than a branding exercise; it is a practical tool for aligning engineering culture, product strategy, and ethical commitments across a growing and evolving organization.
