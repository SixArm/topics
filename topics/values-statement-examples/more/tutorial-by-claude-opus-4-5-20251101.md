## Values Statement Examples: A Guide for Technology Professionals

### What Is a Values Statement?

A values statement articulates the core principles, beliefs, and ethical standards that guide an organization's behavior and decision-making. Unlike mission statements (which define purpose) or vision statements (which describe future aspirations), values statements establish the fundamental commitments that shape company culture and daily operations.

For technology professionals, understanding values statements matters because they influence hiring decisions, product development priorities, partnership criteria, and workplace culture. Whether you're evaluating potential employers, building your own startup, or aligning engineering practices with organizational principles, values statements provide essential context.

### Key Characteristics of Effective Values Statements

| Characteristic | Description | Why It Matters |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Specificity | Focuses on particular behaviors or commitments | Differentiates from generic platitudes |
| Actionability | Can be translated into concrete decisions | Guides daily operations and trade-offs |
| Authenticity | Reflects actual organizational practice | Builds trust with stakeholders |
| Memorability | Simple enough to recall and reference | Enables cultural reinforcement |
| Distinctiveness | Unique to the organization's identity | Creates competitive differentiation |

### Industry Examples and Analysis

#### Starbucks

**Statement**: "Creating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome."

This values statement emphasizes:
- Inclusive community building
- Emotional experience over transactional service
- Universal accessibility regardless of background

For technology teams, this translates to designing systems that accommodate diverse users, building accessible interfaces, and creating welcoming onboarding experiences for both customers and employees.

#### Ben & Jerry's

**Statement**: "We're committed to making ice cream in the most socially responsible way we can."

Key elements include:
- Product excellence as a baseline expectation
- Social responsibility integrated into core business
- Acknowledgment of continuous improvement ("way we can")

Technology professionals at mission-driven companies can apply this approach by considering supply chain ethics, environmental impact of infrastructure choices, and equitable access to services.

#### Airbnb

**Statement**: "Be a host, not a landlord."

This statement creates a clear behavioral distinction:
- Prioritizes personal connection over transactional relationships
- Sets expectations for community standards
- Differentiates the platform from traditional hospitality

For engineers and product teams, this value guides feature development toward fostering genuine interactions rather than optimizing purely for revenue extraction.

#### Patagonia

**Statement**: "Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis."

This comprehensive statement addresses three dimensions:

| Dimension | Commitment | Implication |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Product | Build the best | Quality and durability over planned obsolescence |
| Process | Cause no unnecessary harm | Supply chain transparency and accountability |
| Purpose | Inspire and implement solutions | Activism as business strategy |

Technology organizations can adopt similar multi-dimensional values that address product quality, operational ethics, and broader societal contribution.

#### Google

**Statement**: "Focus on the user and all else will follow."

This user-centric value provides:
- Clear prioritization framework for product decisions
- Justification for long-term investment over short-term gains
- Cultural alignment around customer experience

Engineering teams operationalize this through user research integration, performance optimization, and accessibility compliance.

#### The Body Shop

**Statement**: "Dedicate our business to the pursuit of social and environmental change."

This statement positions the organization as:
- Change-oriented rather than stability-focused
- Committed to causes beyond shareholder value
- Integrated in its approach to social and environmental concerns

For technology companies, this model demonstrates how values can explicitly prioritize external impact alongside business success.

### Crafting Values Statements for Technology Organizations

When developing values statements for technology teams or companies, consider these principles:

**Be specific about trade-offs**. Generic values like "integrity" or "excellence" provide little guidance when difficult decisions arise. Specify what you prioritize when values conflict.

**Address technology-specific concerns**. Consider including positions on:
- User privacy and data stewardship
- Algorithmic fairness and transparency
- Environmental impact of computing resources
- Accessibility and inclusive design
- Security and responsible disclosure

**Make values operational**. Each value should connect to observable behaviors. If a value cannot influence a hiring decision, a product feature, or a policy choice, it lacks practical utility.

**Test for authenticity**. Values statements create expectations. Ensure the organization can credibly commit to stated values through policies, incentives, and accountability mechanisms.

### Values Statements vs. Related Concepts

| Document Type | Primary Question | Time Orientation | Example |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Mission Statement | Why do we exist? | Present | "Organize the world's information" |
| Vision Statement | What future do we want? | Future | "A world where everyone belongs" |
| Values Statement | How do we behave? | Ongoing | "Focus on the user" |
| Code of Conduct | What rules must we follow? | Present | Specific prohibited behaviors |

### Applying Values Statements in Technology Work

Values statements inform several domains of technology practice:

**Product Development**
- Feature prioritization based on user impact
- Ethical review of algorithmic systems
- Accessibility requirements in design specifications

**Engineering Culture**
- Code review standards and feedback norms
- On-call expectations and work-life boundaries
- Knowledge sharing and documentation practices

**Hiring and Performance**
- Interview criteria beyond technical competence
- Performance evaluation dimensions
- Promotion and recognition criteria

**Vendor and Partner Selection**
- Supply chain and contractor requirements
- Open source contribution policies
- Data sharing and privacy agreements

### Conclusion

Values statements serve as decision-making frameworks that translate organizational identity into daily practice. The examples from Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's, Airbnb, Patagonia, Google, and The Body Shop demonstrate how specific, actionable values differentiate organizations and guide stakeholder expectations.

For technology professionals, values statements provide context for understanding organizational priorities, evaluating cultural fit, and aligning technical decisions with broader principles. Whether you're joining an existing organization or building a new one, clearly articulated values create accountability and consistency across complex, distributed teams.
