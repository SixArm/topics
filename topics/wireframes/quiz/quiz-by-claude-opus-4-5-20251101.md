  <p>To serve as a low-fidelity blueprint for planning UI layout and structure</p>
  <p>Wireframes are low-fidelity visual representations created in the early stages of product development. They use simple lines and shapes to represent the basic layout and structure of a user interface, helping design teams conceptualize placement of content and functionality, test user flow and navigation, and communicate with stakeholders before committing to a final design.</p>
