  <p>To provide an overview of system architecture, component organization, and their dependencies</p>
  <p>A package diagram is a static structure diagram in UML that shows how different packages are organized in a hierarchical structure and how they depend on each other. It provides a higher level of abstraction for understanding the system architecture, making it easier to identify relationships between components and maintain the software over time.</p>
