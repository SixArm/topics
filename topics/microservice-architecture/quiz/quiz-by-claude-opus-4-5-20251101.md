# Microservice architecture

Question: What is a key characteristic that distinguishes microservice architecture from monolithic architecture?

- [ ] All services must use the same programming language and technology stack
- [ ] Services are tightly coupled and share a single database
- [ ] Each service is independently deployable and responsible for a specific piece of functionality
- [ ] The entire application must be scaled as a single unit

  <p>Each service is independently deployable and responsible for a specific piece of functionality</p>
  <p>Microservice architecture structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific piece of functionality based on the "single responsibility" principle. This allows services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, which contrasts with monolithic architectures where all functionality is contained within a single, tightly integrated application.</p>
