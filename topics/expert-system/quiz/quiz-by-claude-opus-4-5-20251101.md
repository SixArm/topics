  <p>Knowledge base, inference engine, and user interface</p>
  <p>An expert system consists of three main components: the knowledge base (which stores domain-specific information and rules), the inference engine (which processes input and applies rules to reach conclusions), and the user interface (which allows users to interact with the system). This architecture enables the system to capture human expertise and provide recommendations by reasoning through if-then rules rather than following fixed procedures.</p>
