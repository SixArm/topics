  <p>Group dynamics can influence participant responses, and opinions may not represent the wider population</p>
  <p>While focus groups provide valuable qualitative insights, they have inherent limitations. Group dynamics can cause participants to conform to dominant opinions or be influenced by more vocal members. Additionally, the small sample size (typically 6-10 participants) means the feedback may not accurately represent the broader target audience. Technology professionals should be aware of these limitations when interpreting focus group results and consider complementing them with other research methods.</p>
