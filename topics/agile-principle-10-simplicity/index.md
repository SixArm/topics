# Agile principle 10: Simplicity

"Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential."

This principle emphasizes doing what is necessary to deliver value, avoiding over-engineering and unnecessary complexity. This principle recognizes that every line of code written, every feature added, and every process implemented creates technical debt and maintenance overhead.

This principle manifests when teams resist the temptation to build elaborate frameworks for simple problems. For example, instead of creating a complex user management system with dozens of features, a startup might implement basic authentication first, adding advanced features only when users actually request them. Similarly, developers might choose to use existing libraries rather than building a custom solution from scratch.

The principle also applies to feature development. Consider a social media application where developers might want to implement advanced analytics, multiple theme options, and complex notification systems simultaneously. Practicing simplicity means launching with core features like posting, commenting, and basic notifications first, then iterating based on user feedback.

Another practical example is database design. Rather than creating highly normalized tables with complex relationships anticipating every possible future need, teams might start with simpler structures that solve immediate problems, refactoring as requirements become clearer.
