  <p>The art of maximizing the amount of work not done</p>
  <p>Agile Principle 10 defines simplicity as "the art of maximizing the amount of work not done." This means focusing only on what is necessary to deliver value, avoiding over-engineering and unnecessary complexity. Every feature, line of code, and process creates technical debt and maintenance overhead, so teams should resist building elaborate solutions for simple problems and instead launch with core features first, iterating based on actual user feedback.</p>
