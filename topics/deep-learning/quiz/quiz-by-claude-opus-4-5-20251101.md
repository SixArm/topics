# Deep learning

Question: What distinguishes "deep" learning from other machine learning approaches?

- [ ] It requires manually engineered features designed by domain experts
- [ ] It uses multiple layers of neural networks to learn hierarchical representations
- [ ] It processes data faster than shallow learning algorithms
- [ ] It only works with small, curated datasets

  <p>It uses multiple layers of neural networks to learn hierarchical representations</p>
  <p>The term "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of deep neural networks consisting of multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons. This architecture allows the model to learn progressively more abstract representations—lower layers capture simple features while higher layers capture more complex, abstract features. This hierarchical learning approach enables deep learning models to automatically discover intricate patterns from raw data without requiring hand-engineered features.</p>
