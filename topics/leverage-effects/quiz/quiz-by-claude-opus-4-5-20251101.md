# Leverage effects

Question: What happens to a company's profitability when it has high fixed costs and sales volume increases beyond the break-even point?

- [ ] Unit costs increase because fixed costs must be paid regardless of sales
- [ ] Profits decrease due to diminishing returns on capital investments
- [ ] Profits increase significantly as fixed costs are spread over more units, lowering unit costs
- [ ] Profitability remains unchanged because fixed costs are constant

  <p>Profits increase significantly as fixed costs are spread over more units, lowering unit costs</p>
  <p>This is the positive leverage effect. When a company with high fixed costs exceeds its break-even point, each additional sale contributes more to profit because the fixed costs are distributed across a larger number of units. This results in lower per-unit costs and higher margins on each sale, making leverage particularly powerful in capital-intensive industries like manufacturing.</p>
