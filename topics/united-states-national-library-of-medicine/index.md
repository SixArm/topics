# United States National Library of Medicine (NLM)

The United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), operated by the United
States federal government, is the world's largest medical library.

NLM is a leader in research in computational health informatics. NLM plays a
pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice. NLM’s research
and information services support scientific discovery, health care, and public
health. NLM pioneers new ways to make biomedical data and information more
accessible; builds tools for better data management and personal health; and
helps create a more diverse and data-skilled workforce. NLM enables researchers,
clinicians, and the public to use the vast wealth of biomedical data to improve
health.

NLM’s cutting-edge research and training programs—with a focus on artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, computational biology, and biomedical
informatics and health data standards—help catalyze basic biomedical science,
data-driven discovery, and health care delivery.

NLM is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, and located in Bethesda, Maryland. NLM started in
1836 as a small collection of medical books and journals in the office of the
U.S. Army Surgeon General.
