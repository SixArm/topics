  <p>Cargo Cult Agile</p>
  <p>Cargo Cult Agile refers to teams that adopt agile ceremonies and practices superficially—holding standups, using sprints, and tracking velocity—without truly understanding or embracing the values and principles behind them. This results in going through the motions without achieving the benefits of genuine agile adoption, such as improved collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement.</p>
