# Agile design anti-patterns

Agile design anti-patterns represent common pitfalls that teams encounter when implementing agile methodologies, often undermining the very principles they aim to support. These dysfunctional practices can significantly impact project success and team productivity.

One prevalent anti-pattern is "Big Design Up Front" (BDUF), where teams spend excessive time creating detailed designs before development begins. This contradicts agile's emphasis on iterative development and responding to change. Similarly, "Analysis Paralysis" occurs when teams become stuck in endless planning phases, afraid to make decisions without perfect information.

The "Gold Plating" anti-pattern involves developers adding unnecessary features or over-engineering solutions beyond requirements. This wastes time and resources while potentially introducing complexity that hampers future changes. Conversely, "Technical Debt Accumulation" happens when teams consistently choose quick fixes over proper solutions, creating a mounting burden of poorly structured code.

"Scope Creep" represents another significant challenge, where project requirements continuously expand without proper evaluation or adjustment of timelines and resources. This often leads to missed deadlines and frustrated stakeholders. The "Cargo Cult Agile" anti-pattern involves mechanically following agile practices without understanding their underlying principles, resulting in superficial adoption that fails to deliver expected benefits.

"Micromanagement" within agile teams destroys the self-organizing nature that makes agile effective, while "Lack of Customer Collaboration" violates a core agile principle and often results in products that don't meet user needs. Finally, "Resistance to Change" can manifest at various levels, from individual team members to organizational leadership, preventing teams from adapting and improving their processes.
