  <p>The direct costs associated with producing or acquiring the goods a company sells</p>
  <p>COGS specifically includes direct costs such as materials, labor, and overhead expenses directly tied to production. Indirect costs like rent, electricity, and salaries of employees not directly involved in production are classified as operating expenses, not COGS. Understanding this distinction is crucial for technology professionals analyzing profitability, pricing strategies, and financial health of companies—particularly when evaluating software or hardware product margins.</p>
