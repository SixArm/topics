# Cost of goods sold (COGS)

Cost of goods sold (COGS) is one of the most fundamental financial metrics in any business, including technology companies. It represents the direct costs attributable to producing or delivering the goods and services a company sells. For technology professionals, understanding COGS is essential because it shapes pricing strategies, influences gross margins, and directly determines how investors and executives evaluate a company's financial health. Whether you work at a SaaS startup, a hardware manufacturer, or a cloud infrastructure provider, COGS defines the baseline cost of generating revenue.

## What COGS Includes

COGS captures the direct costs tied to producing or delivering a product or service. These costs are incurred only when revenue is generated; if nothing is sold, COGS is zero. The standard categories include:

- **Raw materials and components**: Physical inputs consumed in manufacturing, such as semiconductors, circuit boards, or packaging materials.
- **Direct labor**: Wages paid to workers who directly produce goods or deliver services, such as assembly line workers or data center technicians.
- **Manufacturing overhead**: Factory utilities, equipment depreciation, and production facility costs that are directly tied to output.
- **Shipping and freight**: Costs to transport finished goods to warehouses or customers.
- **Third-party hosting and infrastructure**: For software and cloud companies, the compute, storage, and bandwidth costs required to deliver a service to customers.

Importantly, COGS does not include indirect expenses such as sales and marketing, research and development, or general administrative overhead. Those fall under operating expenses (OpEx) on the income statement.

## The COGS Formula

The basic formula for calculating COGS over a given period is:

**COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases During the Period − Ending Inventory**

For a technology company that sells physical products, beginning inventory is the value of unsold goods at the start of the period, purchases represent new production or acquisition costs, and ending inventory is the value of unsold goods remaining. For software and services companies that carry no physical inventory, the formula simplifies to the sum of all direct delivery costs incurred during the period.

## COGS in Technology Companies

Technology companies calculate COGS differently depending on their business model. The following table illustrates how COGS varies across common technology segments:

| Business Model | Typical COGS Components | Gross Margin Range |
|---|---|---|
| SaaS / Cloud Software | Cloud hosting, data center operations, customer support for onboarding, third-party API fees | 70%–85% |
| Hardware (e.g., laptops, phones) | Components, assembly labor, shipping, warranty costs | 25%–45% |
| E-commerce / Marketplace | Inventory purchase cost, warehousing, fulfillment, payment processing fees | 30%–50% |
| Managed Services / IT Consulting | Consultant salaries, subcontractor costs, software licenses consumed per engagement | 40%–60% |
| Semiconductor / Chip Design | Wafer fabrication, packaging, testing, foundry fees | 50%–65% |

For SaaS companies, the largest COGS line items are typically cloud infrastructure costs (AWS, Azure, GCP), costs of the customer success team directly supporting onboarding, and amortization of capitalized software development costs. This is why SaaS businesses tend to have very high gross margins compared to hardware businesses.

## Why COGS Matters for Profitability

COGS directly determines gross profit, which is calculated as:

**Gross Profit = Revenue − COGS**

Gross profit is the money left over to cover operating expenses, taxes, and ultimately generate net income. The gross margin percentage (gross profit divided by revenue) is one of the most closely watched metrics by investors and analysts because it reveals how efficiently a company converts revenue into profit before overhead.

- A **high gross margin** indicates strong pricing power, efficient production, or a scalable delivery model. Most successful SaaS companies target gross margins above 75%.
- A **low gross margin** suggests that the company spends heavily to deliver each unit of revenue, leaving less room for R&D investment, marketing, and profit.
- **Declining gross margins** over time can signal rising input costs, pricing pressure from competitors, or inefficient scaling.

If COGS grows faster than revenue, the business is becoming less efficient and may eventually become unprofitable regardless of top-line growth.

## COGS vs. Operating Expenses

Technology professionals frequently encounter confusion between COGS and operating expenses. The distinction matters because each category appears on a different line of the income statement and signals different things about the business.

| Attribute | COGS | Operating Expenses (OpEx) |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | Direct costs to produce/deliver goods or services | Indirect costs to run the business |
| Examples | Hosting fees, component costs, direct labor | R&D salaries, marketing spend, office rent |
| Relationship to revenue | Scales proportionally with revenue | Often semi-fixed or discretionary |
| Impact on financial statements | Determines gross profit | Determines operating profit (EBIT) |
| Investor focus | Gross margin analysis | Operating leverage analysis |

A common mistake is categorizing engineering salaries as COGS. In most technology companies, software engineering costs are classified as R&D (an operating expense), unless the engineers are performing work that directly delivers a service to customers, such as maintaining production infrastructure.

## Inventory Valuation Methods

For companies that carry physical inventory, the method used to value that inventory directly affects COGS. The three primary methods are:

- **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)**: Assumes the oldest inventory is sold first. In periods of rising prices, FIFO produces lower COGS and higher reported profits.
- **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)**: Assumes the newest inventory is sold first. In periods of rising prices, LIFO produces higher COGS and lower reported profits, which can reduce tax liability. LIFO is permitted under US GAAP but prohibited under IFRS.
- **Weighted Average Cost**: Calculates COGS using the average cost of all inventory available during the period. This method smooths out price fluctuations.

For pure software companies with no physical inventory, these methods do not apply. However, technology companies with hardware divisions, such as Apple or Dell, must select and consistently apply an inventory valuation method.

## Strategies to Optimize COGS

Reducing COGS without sacrificing quality is a primary lever for improving profitability. Technology companies commonly pursue the following strategies:

- **Negotiate volume discounts** with cloud providers or component suppliers as scale increases.
- **Optimize cloud resource utilization** by right-sizing instances, using reserved or spot pricing, and eliminating idle resources.
- **Automate manual processes** in production and delivery pipelines to reduce direct labor costs.
- **Improve supply chain efficiency** through better demand forecasting, just-in-time inventory, and logistics optimization.
- **Shift architecture** toward more cost-efficient designs, such as serverless computing or edge caching, to reduce per-unit delivery costs.
- **Renegotiate third-party contracts** for APIs, CDNs, and payment processors as transaction volume grows.

The goal is to achieve operating leverage: as revenue grows, COGS should grow more slowly, expanding gross margins over time.

## Related

After understanding COGS, technology professionals should explore **gross profit and net profit** to see how COGS flows through the full income statement, **balance sheet** fundamentals to understand how inventory is recorded as an asset, **financial ratios** such as gross margin and operating margin for benchmarking, **burn rate** and **annual recurring revenue** for SaaS-specific financial analysis, **return on investment** for evaluating capital efficiency, and **total cost of ownership** for understanding the full lifecycle cost of technology investments.

## Summary

Cost of goods sold is the direct cost a company incurs to produce or deliver its products and services, and it is the single most important factor in determining gross profit. For technology companies, COGS varies dramatically by business model: SaaS companies primarily count cloud infrastructure and support costs, hardware companies count components and manufacturing, and consulting firms count labor and subcontractor fees. By tracking COGS carefully and optimizing it through automation, better vendor contracts, and efficient architecture, technology professionals can directly improve their company's margins, competitiveness, and long-term financial sustainability.
