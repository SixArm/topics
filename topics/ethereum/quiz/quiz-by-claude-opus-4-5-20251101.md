  <p>Smart contract functionality</p>
  <p>Ethereum's smart contract functionality is its most notable distinguishing feature, allowing developers to create self-executing contracts that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. This enables the building of decentralized applications (DApps) for complex financial transactions, supply chain management, and more—capabilities that Bitcoin, which is primarily used as a digital currency, does not natively support.</p>
