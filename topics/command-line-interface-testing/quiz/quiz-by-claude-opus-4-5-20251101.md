# Command Line Interface (CLI) testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of automated CLI testing in software development?

- [ ] To replace manual testing entirely and eliminate the need for human testers
- [ ] To validate functionality, verify outputs, check exit codes, and integrate into continuous integration pipelines
- [ ] To test only the graphical user interface components of applications
- [ ] To measure network latency and bandwidth consumption of CLI tools

  <p>To validate functionality, verify outputs, check exit codes, and integrate into continuous integration pipelines</p>
  <p>Automated CLI testing validates command-line applications by executing commands programmatically, verifying return codes, examining standard output and error streams, and checking file system changes. A key advantage is the ability to integrate seamlessly into continuous integration pipelines, providing rapid feedback during development and ensuring consistent test execution across builds.</p>
