  <p>Adopt sustainable practices including renewable energy, waste reduction, and eco-friendly technologies</p>
  <p>A comprehensive approach to environmental impact requires multiple coordinated efforts rather than a single initiative. This includes adopting renewable energy sources, implementing waste reduction and recycling programs, using eco-friendly technologies, and promoting responsible consumption throughout the organization. Single-focus solutions like only reducing data center electricity or simply purchasing carbon offsets do not address the full scope of environmental challenges including biodiversity loss, pollution, and resource depletion.</p>
