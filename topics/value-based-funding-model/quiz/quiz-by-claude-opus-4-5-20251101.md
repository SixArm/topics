  <p>Value-based models reward providers for delivering high-quality services that improve client outcomes</p>
  <p>The value-based funding model focuses on incentivizing providers to deliver high-quality services that improve client outcomes, while the traditional fee-for-service model pays providers for the quantity of services delivered regardless of whether those services improve outcomes. This fundamental shift aligns provider incentives with client interests and aims to control costs while improving service quality.</p>
