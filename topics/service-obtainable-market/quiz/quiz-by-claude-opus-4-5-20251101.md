  <p>The portion of the Service Addressable Market (SAM) a company can realistically capture given its resources and competitive environment</p>
  <p>SOM represents the realistic market share a company can expect to obtain based on its actual capabilities—including sales and marketing strength, distribution channels, pricing strategy, product differentiation, and customer loyalty. Unlike TAM (total market) or SAM (addressable market), SOM accounts for competitive realities and resource constraints, making it the most practical metric for setting sales goals and allocating resources.</p>
