# Service Obtainable Market (SOM)

Service Obtainable Market (SOM) is the portion of the Service Addressable Market (SAM) that a company can realistically capture and serve given its current business model, resources, competitive position, and go-to-market capabilities. Unlike the broader TAM (Total Addressable Market) and SAM, which represent theoretical opportunity, SOM is the grounded, execution-oriented metric that reflects what a company can actually win. For technology professionals evaluating product strategy, fundraising narratives, or go-to-market plans, SOM is where aspiration meets operational reality.

## How SOM Fits Within Market Sizing

SOM is the innermost layer of the standard three-tier market sizing framework used in business planning, investor pitches, and strategic analysis.

| Metric | Full Name | Definition | Perspective |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| TAM | Total Addressable Market | Total demand for a product or service category across all segments and geographies | Theoretical ceiling |
| SAM | Service Addressable Market | The subset of TAM that your product, pricing, and distribution model can actually reach | Targetable opportunity |
| SOM | Service Obtainable Market | The subset of SAM you can realistically capture given competition, resources, and execution | Achievable revenue |

The relationship is strictly hierarchical: SOM is always a subset of SAM, which is always a subset of TAM. A common mistake is conflating SAM with SOM, which inflates revenue projections and undermines credibility with investors and executives.

## Why SOM Matters for Technology Companies

SOM serves several critical functions in a technology organization:

- **Revenue forecasting**: SOM translates market opportunity into actionable sales targets that finance, sales, and product teams can plan around.
- **Resource allocation**: Understanding obtainable market share helps leadership decide where to invest in engineering, sales headcount, and marketing spend.
- **Investor communication**: Sophisticated investors discount TAM and SAM figures heavily. A well-defended SOM estimate signals operational maturity and market awareness.
- **Competitive positioning**: Calculating SOM forces an honest assessment of how your product stacks up against alternatives, including incumbents, open-source solutions, and emerging competitors.
- **Strategic planning**: SOM helps product managers prioritize features, segments, and geographies that offer the highest probability of capture rather than the largest theoretical opportunity.

## Key Factors That Determine SOM

Several variables influence how much of the addressable market a company can realistically obtain:

- **Sales and marketing capacity**: The size of the sales team, the maturity of the marketing funnel, and the effectiveness of demand generation directly constrain obtainable market share.
- **Distribution channels**: Whether the company sells direct, through partners, via marketplaces, or through self-service models affects reach and conversion rates.
- **Pricing strategy**: Price point relative to competitors determines which segments of the SAM are winnable. Premium pricing narrows SOM; aggressive pricing can expand it but at margin cost.
- **Product differentiation**: Unique capabilities, integrations, performance advantages, or platform effects that create switching costs expand SOM against competitors.
- **Customer retention and loyalty**: High net revenue retention means existing customers expand their spend, compounding SOM over time without proportional acquisition cost.
- **Brand recognition and trust**: In enterprise technology, brand credibility and analyst positioning (e.g., Gartner Magic Quadrant placement) significantly influence obtainable share.
- **Regulatory and compliance readiness**: For sectors like healthcare, finance, and government, compliance certifications (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP) gate access to portions of the SAM.

## How to Calculate SOM

There are two primary approaches to estimating SOM, and mature organizations typically use both to triangulate.

**Top-down approach**: Start with SAM, then apply a realistic market share percentage based on competitive analysis, historical benchmarks, and industry norms. For example, a new entrant in a fragmented SaaS market might estimate capturing 2-5% of SAM within three years.

**Bottom-up approach**: Build SOM from the ground up using actual sales pipeline data, win rates, deal sizes, sales cycle lengths, and territory capacity. This approach is more defensible because it is rooted in operational data rather than assumptions.

| Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best Used When |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Top-down | Quick to calculate; useful for early-stage sizing | Prone to overestimation; relies on assumptions | Exploring new markets or early fundraising |
| Bottom-up | Grounded in real data; more credible | Requires operational history; labor-intensive | Scaling companies with sales data |

The bottom-up approach is generally preferred by experienced investors and operators because it demonstrates that the company understands its own unit economics and go-to-market mechanics.

## SOM Is Dynamic, Not Static

SOM is not a fixed number. It shifts as internal capabilities and external conditions evolve:

- **Market expansion**: Launching in new geographies or verticals increases SAM and potentially SOM.
- **Product improvements**: New features, integrations, or platform capabilities can unlock previously inaccessible segments.
- **Competitive moves**: A competitor exiting the market, raising prices, or suffering a security breach can temporarily or permanently expand your SOM.
- **Macroeconomic shifts**: Economic downturns may shrink budgets and reduce SOM, while digital transformation trends may expand it.
- **Go-to-market maturation**: Building a partner ecosystem, hiring experienced sales leadership, or achieving product-led growth flywheel effects all grow SOM over time.

Companies should reassess SOM at least quarterly as part of their strategic planning cadence, updating assumptions based on pipeline data, win/loss analysis, and market intelligence.

## Common Mistakes in SOM Estimation

- **Overestimating market share**: Claiming 10-20% of a large market without a defensible rationale for how you will win against established competitors.
- **Ignoring competition entirely**: Treating the SAM as if no alternatives exist, including do-nothing and build-in-house options.
- **Confusing SOM with SAM**: Presenting the addressable market as the obtainable market, which signals a lack of strategic rigor.
- **Static analysis**: Treating SOM as a one-time calculation rather than a living metric that evolves with execution and market dynamics.
- **Neglecting churn**: Calculating SOM based on gross acquisition without accounting for customer churn, which erodes realized market share.

## Summary

Service Obtainable Market (SOM) is the most operationally meaningful tier of the TAM-SAM-SOM framework, representing the market share a company can realistically capture based on its current resources, competitive position, distribution capabilities, and execution capacity. Unlike TAM and SAM, which describe theoretical opportunity, SOM demands an honest reckoning with constraints and competition. Technology professionals should calculate SOM using both top-down and bottom-up methods, treat it as a dynamic metric that evolves with the business, and use it to drive resource allocation, revenue planning, and strategic prioritization. A well-defended SOM estimate is one of the strongest signals of operational maturity a company can present to investors, partners, and internal stakeholders.
