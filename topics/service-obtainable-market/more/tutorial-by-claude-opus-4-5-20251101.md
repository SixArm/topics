## Service Obtainable Market (SOM)

Service Obtainable Market (SOM) represents the realistic portion of your target market that your company can actually capture given current resources, capabilities, and competitive positioning. Unlike theoretical market sizing, SOM grounds your business planning in practical reality.

## Understanding the Market Sizing Hierarchy

SOM sits at the bottom of a three-tier market sizing framework. Each tier narrows the focus from theoretical maximum to achievable target.

| Market Metric | Definition | Question Answered |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| **TAM** (Total Addressable Market) | Total demand for a product/service category worldwide | "How big is the entire market?" |
| **SAM** (Service Addressable Market) | Portion of TAM your business model can serve | "What segment can we actually reach?" |
| **SOM** (Service Obtainable Market) | Portion of SAM you can realistically capture | "What share can we win?" |

## Key Factors That Determine SOM

Your SOM calculation depends on multiple competitive and operational variables:

- **Sales and marketing capabilities** — Your team's ability to generate leads, close deals, and retain customers
- **Distribution channels** — Access to markets through direct sales, partnerships, retail, or digital platforms
- **Pricing strategy** — Competitive positioning relative to alternatives and customer willingness to pay
- **Product differentiation** — Unique value propositions that distinguish you from competitors
- **Customer loyalty and switching costs** — Existing relationships and barriers that affect market entry
- **Operational capacity** — Manufacturing, service delivery, or platform scalability limits
- **Geographic reach** — Physical presence or logistics capabilities in target regions
- **Brand recognition** — Market awareness and reputation among target customers

## Calculating SOM

The SOM calculation follows a systematic narrowing approach:

1. **Start with TAM** — Estimate total market demand in your category
2. **Define SAM** — Identify the segment your offerings and business model can serve
3. **Apply competitive filters** — Assess your realistic capture rate based on competitive position
4. **Factor in constraints** — Account for resource limitations, capacity, and growth rate
5. **Validate bottom-up** — Cross-check with customer acquisition projections and sales pipeline data

Most early-stage companies capture 1-5% of their SAM in initial years. Established players with strong differentiation may target 10-25% depending on market fragmentation.

## Why SOM Matters for Technology Professionals

| Use Case | SOM Application |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Investor pitches** | Demonstrates realistic revenue expectations rather than inflated projections |
| **Resource allocation** | Guides hiring, infrastructure, and marketing budget decisions |
| **Sales forecasting** | Sets achievable quotas based on market reality |
| **Strategic planning** | Identifies gaps between current capture and potential opportunity |
| **Go-to-market strategy** | Focuses efforts on winnable segments rather than entire markets |
| **Product roadmap** | Prioritizes features that expand obtainable market share |

## SOM vs. Market Share

SOM and market share are related but distinct concepts:

- **SOM** is forward-looking — it projects what you can capture
- **Market share** is backward-looking — it measures what you have captured
- A healthy business shows market share approaching SOM over time
- If market share significantly lags SOM, execution problems may exist
- If market share exceeds SOM projections, reassess your competitive position upward

## Dynamic Nature of SOM

SOM is not static. Regular reassessment accounts for:

- **Competitive entries or exits** — New players or consolidation changes the landscape
- **Technology shifts** — Platform changes can expand or contract obtainable segments
- **Regulatory changes** — Compliance requirements can create or remove barriers
- **Customer behavior evolution** — Preference shifts affect product-market fit
- **Company capability growth** — Team expansion, partnerships, and product improvements expand reach

Quarterly or annual SOM reviews keep strategic planning aligned with market reality.

## Common Mistakes in SOM Analysis

- **Conflating SOM with SAM** — Overstating obtainable share based on addressable market size
- **Ignoring competition** — Assuming market share is available without competitive analysis
- **Static assumptions** — Failing to update SOM as conditions change
- **Top-down only** — Relying solely on market percentages without bottom-up validation
- **Capacity blindness** — Projecting capture rates that exceed operational ability to deliver

## Practical Application

For technology professionals building business cases or strategic plans, SOM provides the credible revenue foundation. When presenting to stakeholders:

- Lead with SOM for near-term projections (1-2 years)
- Reference SAM for medium-term growth potential (3-5 years)
- Use TAM to illustrate long-term market opportunity
- Show the path from current SOM to expanded capture through specific initiatives

This layered approach demonstrates both ambition and pragmatism—essential for gaining stakeholder confidence in technology investments.
