  <p>The variables have no linear relationship</p>
  <p>The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no correlation, meaning there is no linear relationship between the two variables. A value of 1 indicates perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates perfect negative correlation, and it's important to remember that correlation does not imply causation.</p>
