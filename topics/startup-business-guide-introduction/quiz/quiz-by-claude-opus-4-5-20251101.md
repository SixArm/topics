  <p>It creates shared context and clearer communication, accelerating collaboration</p>
  <p>The guide explains that glossaries help create "shared context and clearer communication" which can "accelerate working together" and help teams "forge better project plans." This is described as being like "singing from the same songbook" - when teammates understand the same terminology and have quick access to definitions, they collaborate more effectively, especially across different cultures, countries, industries, or ways of working.</p>
