# What is this book?

Startup Business Guide is a glossary guide ebook that describes one topic per page. The guide is intended for quick easy learning about concepts, tactics, and ideas.

### Why these topics?

All the topics here are chosen because they have come up in real-world projects, with real-world stakeholders who want to learn about the topic.

If you have suggestions for more topics, then please let me know.

Some of the topics are related, so they are grouped into sections. For example, see the topic about change management: in the table of contents, it's listed as the first topic in a section that contains various kinds of change management techniques. The section grouping is intended to help readers get up to speed faster. If you have suggestions for new groups, or topics that should be in existing groups, then please let me know.

### What is the topic order?

## Who is this for?

People should read this guide if they want to learn quickly about startup business concepts, and how these concepts are practiced in companies today.

For you, the value of the guide is in being able to quickly and easily ramp up on startup business concepts.

If students are able to learn what's in this book, they will have a big advantage when they go for job interviews for roles that involve startup business.


## Why is this useful??

I am creating this ebook because of years of experience in startup business work, with a wide range of clients, from small startups to enormous enterprises.


### For team collaboration

When I work with companies and teams, then I'm able to use glossaries like this one to help create shared context and clearer communication. This can accelerate working together, and can help teams forge better project plans, in my direct experience.

For example, one of my enterprise clients describes this kind of shared context and clear communication in a positive sense as "singing from the same songbook". When a team understands startup business terminology, and has a quick easy glossary for definitions and explanations, then it's akin to teammates with the same songbook.


### For cross-cultural communication

What I discovered is that these kinds of glossaries can be especially helpful for teams with members coming from various cultures, such as from different countries, or different industries, or different ways of working. The topic pages help provide a baseline for better collaboration.

What I discovered with teammates from non-Western or non-English backgrounds is that startup business has many social quotations, aphorisms, and idioms that come up frequently and that that teammates are expected to know.

For example, my peers in San Francisco Bay Area startups will likely know the quotation "Move fast and break things", the aphorism "Brook's Law", and the idiom "Get on the front foot". But these aren't familiar to many people from many other places. The topic pages cover these, to improve shared understanding.
