  <p>The accumulated cost of short-term trade-offs that create long-term problems requiring additional work</p>
  <p>Technical debt, a term coined by Ward Cunningham, is a metaphor describing how deliberate decisions to save time in the short term—such as using quick-and-dirty coding techniques, ignoring code quality standards, or skipping testing—create accumulated costs over time. Like financial debt, it accrues "interest" the longer it remains unaddressed, leading to slower development, reduced reliability, decreased performance, and increased maintenance costs.</p>
