# Generative artificial intelligence

Question: What is the primary purpose of the discriminator network in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)?

- [ ] To encode data into a lower-dimensional latent space
- [ ] To generate new data samples that resemble the training data
- [ ] To differentiate between real and generated data samples
- [ ] To sequentially predict the next element based on previous elements

  <p>To differentiate between real and generated data samples</p>
  <p>In a GAN, two neural networks work together: the generator creates new data samples, while the discriminator's job is to distinguish between real data from the training set and fake data produced by the generator. This adversarial relationship drives the generator to improve its output quality until the generated samples become indistinguishable from real data.</p>
