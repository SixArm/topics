  <p>To visualize concepts, gather feedback, and identify potential problems before full development</p>
  <p>Mockups are created early in the design process to help stakeholders visualize and test different design ideas, layouts, and functionalities. They provide a way to communicate design concepts, gather feedback from clients, users, or team members, and identify potential problems or issues with the design before investing resources in developing a full-scale product.</p>
