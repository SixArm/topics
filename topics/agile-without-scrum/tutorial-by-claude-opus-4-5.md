# Agile Without Scrum: Tutorial

## Overview

Scrum dominates many conversations about agile software development, to the point where the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, agile is a broad philosophy encompassing many methodologies, frameworks, and practices -- and Scrum is just one of them. Many successful teams and organizations practice agile without using Scrum at all, drawing instead from approaches like Extreme Programming (XP), Kanban, Lean, Feature-Driven Development (FDD), Crystal, or hybrid combinations tailored to their context.

This tutorial provides change technology professionals with a comprehensive understanding of agile methodologies beyond Scrum, helping them evaluate and select the approaches best suited to their teams and organizational needs.

## Key Concepts

### The Agile Umbrella

The Agile Manifesto defines four values and twelve principles that form the foundation of agile thinking. No specific methodology is prescribed. Scrum is one implementation of these values, but it is not the only valid one. Understanding this distinction is critical for change technology professionals who must guide organizations toward the right approach rather than a default one.

The four agile values are:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

### Extreme Programming (XP)

XP focuses on technical excellence as the foundation of agility. Its core practices include:

- **Pair Programming:** Two developers work together at one workstation, improving code quality and spreading knowledge.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Tests are written before production code, ensuring comprehensive coverage and guiding design.
- **Continuous Integration:** Code is integrated and tested frequently, often multiple times per day.
- **Refactoring:** Code is continuously improved in structure without changing its behavior.
- **Simple Design:** Solutions are kept as simple as possible, avoiding speculative complexity.
- **Collective Code Ownership:** Any developer can modify any part of the codebase.

XP is particularly well-suited to teams that want to prioritize code quality, sustainable pace, and technical discipline.

### Kanban

Kanban provides a visual workflow management system without prescribing specific roles, ceremonies, or timeboxes. Its key elements include:

- **Visual Board:** All work is represented on a board that makes the workflow visible to everyone.
- **Work-In-Progress (WIP) Limits:** The number of items in each workflow stage is limited, preventing overload and exposing bottlenecks.
- **Continuous Flow:** Work moves through the system as capacity allows, rather than being batched into sprints.
- **Evolutionary Change:** Processes are improved gradually based on data and observation.

Kanban is ideal for teams with variable workloads, maintenance-heavy responsibilities, or a need for continuous delivery without sprint boundaries.

### Lean Software Development

Lean draws from manufacturing principles pioneered by Toyota and applies them to software development. Its seven principles are:

- Eliminate waste.
- Amplify learning.
- Decide as late as possible.
- Deliver as fast as possible.
- Empower the team.
- Build integrity in.
- Optimize the whole.

Lean is particularly valuable for organizations seeking to reduce overhead, bureaucracy, and non-value-adding activities in their development process.

### Feature-Driven Development (FDD)

FDD structures work around specific, client-valued features. It involves five main activities: developing an overall model, building a feature list, planning by feature, designing by feature, and building by feature. FDD is well-suited for larger projects with well-defined requirements where a feature-centric approach provides clarity and structure.

### Crystal Methodologies

Crystal is a family of methodologies created by Alistair Cockburn, tailored to different team sizes and project criticality levels. Crystal Clear is designed for small teams, while Crystal Orange and Crystal Red address larger teams and higher-risk projects. Crystal emphasizes frequent delivery, osmotic communication, reflective improvement, and personal safety.

### Hybrid Approaches

Many successful agile implementations are not pure implementations of any single framework. Teams combine elements from multiple methodologies -- for example, using Kanban boards for workflow visualization, XP practices for technical discipline, and Lean principles for waste elimination. The key is aligning the chosen practices with the team's context, culture, and challenges.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Understand your context before choosing a framework.** Evaluate your team size, project type, organizational culture, technical maturity, and customer relationship. Different contexts favor different approaches:
   - High technical complexity with strong developers: consider XP.
   - Variable workloads and operational support: consider Kanban.
   - Large projects with clear requirements: consider FDD.
   - Need for minimal process overhead: consider Lean.
   - Small, co-located teams: consider Crystal Clear.

2. **Start with agile values, not framework mechanics.** Ensure your team understands and embraces the four agile values. Any methodology you choose should serve these values, not the other way around.

3. **Evaluate what Scrum solves and what it does not.** If your organization currently uses Scrum and is considering alternatives, identify specifically what is and is not working. The solution may be supplementing Scrum rather than replacing it entirely.

4. **Adopt technical practices regardless of methodology.** Practices like automated testing, continuous integration, refactoring, and collective code ownership improve outcomes regardless of which framework you use. XP practices in particular complement any agile approach.

5. **Make work visible.** Whether or not you use Kanban formally, visualizing your workflow on a board helps every team. It exposes bottlenecks, creates shared understanding, and facilitates coordination.

6. **Limit work in progress.** Regardless of methodology, limiting WIP reduces context switching, improves flow, and leads to faster completion of individual items. This principle from Kanban is universally applicable.

7. **Build a hybrid approach intentionally.** If you combine elements from multiple frameworks, do so deliberately. Document your team's working agreements, the practices you have adopted, and the rationale for each choice. Avoid accidentally creating an incoherent process.

8. **Measure and adapt.** Track metrics relevant to your goals -- cycle time, throughput, defect rate, customer satisfaction -- and use them to evaluate whether your chosen approach is working. Be willing to change practices based on evidence.

9. **Invest in coaching and education.** Transitioning to an agile methodology beyond Scrum may require new skills and mindsets. Invest in training, coaching, and communities of practice to support the transition.

10. **Communicate the rationale.** When moving away from Scrum or adopting a less well-known methodology, clearly communicate to stakeholders why the change is being made and what benefits are expected. This builds organizational support and patience during the transition.

## Key Takeaway

Agile is a philosophy, not a specific framework. While Scrum is the most widely known agile methodology, it is not always the best fit for every team or context. Change technology professionals should develop fluency in multiple agile approaches -- including XP, Kanban, Lean, FDD, and Crystal -- and be prepared to select, combine, and adapt these methodologies to create the approach that best serves their team's unique situation. The goal is not rigid adherence to any single framework but faithful embodiment of agile values: prioritizing individuals, working software, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change.
