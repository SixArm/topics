# Agile without Scrum

Question: What is the primary advantage of using Kanban as an agile methodology instead of Scrum?

- [ ] It requires mandatory daily standup meetings and sprint planning sessions
- [ ] It provides a visual workflow management system without prescriptive roles or ceremonies
- [ ] It focuses exclusively on pair programming and test-driven development
- [ ] It structures work around two-week fixed-length iterations

  <p>It provides a visual workflow management system without prescriptive roles or ceremonies</p>
  <p>Kanban offers teams flexibility by focusing on work-in-progress limits and continuous flow rather than prescribed roles (like Scrum Master or Product Owner) or ceremonies (like sprint planning or retrospectives). This allows teams to evolve their processes gradually while maintaining visibility into bottlenecks and inefficiencies, making it particularly suitable for teams that want agile benefits without the structural requirements of Scrum.</p>
