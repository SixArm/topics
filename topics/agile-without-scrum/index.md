# Agile without Scrum

Agile software development extends far beyond Scrum, encompassing a rich ecosystem of methodologies and practices that embrace the core principles of iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptive planning. While Scrum dominates many discussions about agile, numerous other frameworks offer valuable approaches to software engineering that can be equally effective or even more suitable for specific contexts.

Extreme Programming (XP) focuses on technical practices like pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration. XP emphasizes code quality and technical excellence through practices such as refactoring, simple design, and collective code ownership.

Kanban provides a visual workflow management system that helps teams optimize their delivery process without prescriptive roles or ceremonies. By focusing on work-in-progress limits and continuous flow, Kanban allows teams to evolve their processes gradually while maintaining visibility into bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

Lean software development draws from manufacturing principles, emphasizing waste elimination, amplifying learning, and delivering value quickly. This approach encourages teams to focus on essential features while minimizing overhead and bureaucracy.

Feature-driven development (FDD) structures work around specific features, making it suitable for larger projects with well-defined requirements. Crystal methodologies offer a family of approaches tailored to different team sizes and project criticality levels.

Many successful agile implementations combine elements from multiple methodologies, creating hybrid approaches that fit their unique organizational context. The key lies not in rigid adherence to any single framework but in embracing agile values: individuals over processes, working software over documentation, customer collaboration over contracts, and responding to change over following plans.
