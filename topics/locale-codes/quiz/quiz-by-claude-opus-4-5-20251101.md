  <p>English as spoken in the United States</p>
  <p>A locale code combines a language code and a country code to define a specific linguistic and cultural context. In "en-US", "en" is the ISO 639-1 language code for English, and "US" is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for the United States. This combination specifies English language conventions as used in the United States, which affects formatting for dates, numbers, currency, and other locale-specific elements.</p>
