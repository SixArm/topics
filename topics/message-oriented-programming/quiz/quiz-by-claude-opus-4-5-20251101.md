# Message-oriented programming

Question: What is the primary benefit of message-oriented programming for software architecture?

- [ ] It requires all components to share a common database
- [ ] It enables synchronous-only communication between services
- [ ] It provides loose coupling between components, allowing independent development and deployment
- [ ] It eliminates the need for unique identifiers in data transfer

  <p>It provides loose coupling between components, allowing independent development and deployment</p>
  <p>Message-oriented programming focuses on exchanging messages between self-contained components rather than sharing data directly. This loose coupling means components can be developed, tested, and deployed independently of each other, making the development process more efficient and improving fault tolerance since errors in one component won't necessarily impact the rest of the system.</p>
