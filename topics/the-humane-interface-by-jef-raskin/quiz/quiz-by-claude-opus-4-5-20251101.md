# The Humane Interface by Jef Raskin

Question: According to Jef Raskin's "The Humane Interface," why does he advocate for modeless interfaces in user interface design?

- [ ] They allow for more complex feature sets and power-user shortcuts
- [ ] They enable better visual aesthetics and modern design patterns
- [ ] Mode-switching causes user confusion and errors due to inconsistent system behavior
- [ ] They reduce the amount of code needed to implement the interface

  <p>Mode-switching causes user confusion and errors due to inconsistent system behavior</p>
  <p>Raskin advocated for modeless interfaces where the system's behavior remains consistent across all contexts. When interfaces have modes, the same user action can produce different results depending on the current mode, which leads to confusion, unexpected outcomes, and user errors. A modeless design ensures predictable, consistent responses to user inputs.</p>
