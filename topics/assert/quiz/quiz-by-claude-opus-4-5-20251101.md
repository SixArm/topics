# Assert

Question: What is the primary purpose of assert statements in automated software testing?

- [ ] To generate documentation for test cases automatically
- [ ] To measure the execution time of code under test
- [ ] To verify expected behavior by evaluating whether specific conditions are true or false
- [ ] To compile the source code before running tests

  <p>To verify expected behavior by evaluating whether specific conditions are true or false</p>
  <p>Assert statements serve as checkpoints that evaluate conditions during test execution. When an assertion passes, it confirms the code behaves as expected. When it fails, it immediately signals a discrepancy between actual and expected results, making it easier to identify and isolate bugs. This verification capability forms the foundation of regression testing and continuous integration pipelines.</p>
