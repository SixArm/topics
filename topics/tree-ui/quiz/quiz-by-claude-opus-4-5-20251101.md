  <p>To enable users to focus on specific sections and navigate through hierarchical data efficiently</p>
  <p>Expandable and collapsible nodes are a key aspect of tree UIs that allow users to reveal or hide sub-levels of information. This functionality helps users manage complex hierarchical data by letting them focus on relevant sections while hiding unnecessary detail, making navigation through large data structures more efficient.</p>
