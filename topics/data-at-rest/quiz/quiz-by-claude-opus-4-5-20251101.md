# Data-at-rest

Question: What is the primary purpose of encrypting data-at-rest?

- [ ] To compress data and reduce storage costs
- [ ] To speed up data retrieval from storage devices
- [ ] To protect sensitive data by converting plaintext to ciphertext, making it unreadable without a decryption key
- [ ] To automatically back up data to multiple locations

  <p>To protect sensitive data by converting plaintext to ciphertext, making it unreadable without a decryption key</p>
  <p>Encryption is a crucial security measure for data-at-rest that converts plaintext data into ciphertext using cryptographic algorithms. This ensures that even if storage media is stolen or compromised, attackers cannot access the sensitive data without the decryption key, thereby maintaining confidentiality of the stored information.</p>
