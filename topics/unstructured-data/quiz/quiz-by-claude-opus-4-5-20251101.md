  <p>It lacks a predefined organizational format</p>
  <p>Unstructured data is data that is not organized in any apparent way. Unlike structured data, which fits neatly into tables with rows and columns, unstructured data requires additional processing or organization before it can be effectively analyzed. Examples include text documents, images, videos, emails, and social media posts.</p>
