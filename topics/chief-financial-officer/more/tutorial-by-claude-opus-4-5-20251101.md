**Growth vs. Profitability Balance**
Tech CFOs often manage the tension between aggressive growth investment and path to profitability. They must articulate unit economics and long-term value creation to investors.

Equity compensation is prevalent in tech. CFOs manage dilution, expense recognition, and the interplay between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics.
