# Burn rate

Burn rate is a financial metric that measures how quickly a company is spending its cash reserves. It represents the rate at which a company is "burning through" its available capital before reaching profitability or securing additional funding. For technology professionals, whether you are founding a startup, leading engineering at a growth-stage company, or evaluating potential employers, understanding burn rate is essential. It directly influences hiring plans, product timelines, infrastructure investment, and the strategic decisions that shape a company's trajectory.

## Why burn rate matters in technology

Technology companies, especially startups and venture-backed firms, typically operate at a loss during their early years. They invest heavily in product development, cloud infrastructure, talent acquisition, and go-to-market activities long before revenue catches up. Burn rate quantifies this spending velocity and, when paired with the company's cash on hand, reveals its financial runway — the amount of time the company can continue operating under current conditions.

For technology professionals, burn rate is not merely an accounting concept. A high burn rate with declining runway can signal imminent layoffs, project cancellations, or pressure to pivot. A well-managed burn rate signals disciplined leadership and a viable path to sustainability. Understanding this metric helps engineers, product managers, and technical leaders make informed career and operational decisions.

## Gross burn rate versus net burn rate

There are two primary forms of burn rate, and confusing them leads to inaccurate financial assessments.

| Type | Definition | Formula | Best used when |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Gross burn rate | Total monthly cash expenditures, regardless of revenue | Total monthly operating expenses | Evaluating total cost structure and spending discipline |
| Net burn rate | Monthly cash loss after accounting for incoming revenue | Monthly expenses minus monthly revenue | Assessing actual cash depletion and calculating runway |

**Gross burn rate** counts every dollar going out the door: salaries, rent, cloud hosting fees, marketing spend, and all other operating costs. It is useful for understanding total cost exposure.

**Net burn rate** subtracts any revenue the company earns from its gross burn. This is the more actionable figure because it reflects the actual rate at which cash reserves are shrinking. A company with $100,000 in monthly expenses but $40,000 in monthly revenue has a net burn rate of $60,000 per month.

## Calculating burn rate and runway

Burn rate is typically measured on a monthly basis. The core calculations are straightforward:

- **Gross burn rate** = Total monthly operating expenses
- **Net burn rate** = Total monthly operating expenses minus total monthly revenue
- **Runway (in months)** = Current cash reserves divided by net burn rate

For example, if a company holds $3,000,000 in cash reserves and has a net burn rate of $150,000 per month, its runway is 20 months. This means the company can operate for approximately 20 months before exhausting its funds, assuming no changes in spending or revenue.

Key considerations when performing these calculations:

- Use a trailing three-month or six-month average to smooth out irregular expenses such as annual software license renewals or one-time equipment purchases.
- Include all cash outflows, not just payroll. Cloud infrastructure costs, contractor fees, legal expenses, and office leases all contribute to burn.
- Account for committed but not yet disbursed expenses, such as signed hiring offers or contracted vendor agreements.

## Common factors that drive burn rate in technology companies

Technology companies have a distinctive cost profile compared to other industries. The primary drivers of burn rate include:

- **Personnel costs.** Engineering salaries, benefits, and equity compensation typically represent 60 to 80 percent of a technology startup's expenses. Aggressive hiring is the fastest way to increase burn rate.
- **Cloud infrastructure.** Hosting, compute, storage, and bandwidth costs scale with product usage and can grow unpredictably. Companies building data-intensive or AI-driven products face particularly high infrastructure bills.
- **Sales and marketing.** Customer acquisition costs, advertising spend, sales team compensation, and event sponsorships can consume a significant portion of the budget, especially during go-to-market pushes.
- **Research and development.** Investment in new product lines, prototyping, and technical exploration increases burn but may be necessary for long-term competitiveness.
- **Office and overhead.** Rent, insurance, legal counsel, accounting services, and administrative tools contribute to fixed overhead.

## Interpreting burn rate signals

Burn rate must always be interpreted in context. The same dollar figure can be healthy or alarming depending on the company's stage, growth trajectory, and access to capital.

| Signal | What it may indicate |
|--------|---------------------|
| High burn rate with strong revenue growth | Intentional investment in scaling; may be strategically sound |
| High burn rate with flat or declining revenue | Unsustainable spending; potential cash crisis ahead |
| Low burn rate with strong product-market fit | Capital-efficient operation; attractive to investors |
| Low burn rate with no product-market fit | Under-investment; may be moving too slowly to compete |
| Rapidly increasing burn rate | Aggressive expansion or loss of cost discipline; warrants scrutiny |
| Decreasing burn rate | Cost optimization in progress or revenue gains closing the gap |

Investors typically expect startups to maintain 12 to 18 months of runway at all times. Falling below this threshold triggers fundraising urgency and can weaken negotiating leverage. Companies that consistently demonstrate capital efficiency — delivering growth while managing burn — tend to attract more favorable investment terms.

## Strategies for managing burn rate

Technology leaders can influence burn rate through deliberate operational choices:

- **Prioritize hiring ruthlessly.** Each new hire increases monthly burn by the fully loaded cost of that employee for the foreseeable future. Hire only for roles that directly advance the company's most critical objectives.
- **Optimize cloud spend.** Implement cost monitoring, right-size instances, use reserved capacity pricing, and architect for efficiency. Cloud cost optimization is one of the most immediate levers available to engineering leadership.
- **Phase investments.** Rather than funding multiple initiatives simultaneously, sequence them. This reduces peak burn and provides decision points to evaluate results before committing additional resources.
- **Negotiate vendor contracts.** Annual prepayment discounts, startup programs from major cloud providers, and competitive bidding can meaningfully reduce fixed costs.
- **Monitor unit economics.** Track customer acquisition cost, lifetime value, and gross margin alongside burn rate. Improving unit economics reduces the amount of cash required to grow.
- **Establish a financial cadence.** Review burn rate and runway monthly at the leadership level. Quarterly reviews are too infrequent for fast-moving technology companies.

## Burn rate and fundraising dynamics

Burn rate is central to fundraising conversations. Investors evaluate it to understand how efficiently a company deploys capital and how urgently it needs additional funding.

A company that approaches investors with less than six months of runway is negotiating from a position of weakness. Conversely, a company with 18 or more months of runway can be selective about timing and terms. The relationship between burn rate and fundraising follows a predictable pattern:

- Companies typically raise enough capital to fund 18 to 24 months of operations at their projected burn rate.
- The fundraising process itself often takes three to six months, during which burn continues.
- Post-fundraising, burn rate often increases as the company deploys new capital into growth initiatives.
- Investors monitor burn rate through board reporting and expect transparency about any significant changes.

For technology professionals evaluating job offers at startups, asking about burn rate and runway provides a concrete indicator of the company's financial stability and the likelihood of continued employment.

## Limitations of burn rate as a metric

Burn rate is a valuable but incomplete measure of financial health. It should be evaluated alongside other metrics to form a complete picture:

- **Revenue growth rate.** A high burn rate may be justified if revenue is growing rapidly enough to reach profitability within the available runway.
- **Gross margin.** Companies with strong gross margins need less additional capital to reach break-even than those with thin margins.
- **Customer acquisition cost and lifetime value.** These unit economics determine whether growth spending is creating durable value or simply consuming cash.
- **Cash flow timing.** Burn rate calculations assume steady monthly outflows, but actual cash flows can be lumpy due to quarterly payments, annual renewals, or seasonal revenue patterns.
- **Non-cash expenses.** Stock-based compensation, depreciation, and amortization affect accounting results but do not consume cash. Burn rate should focus on actual cash expenditures.

## Summary

Burn rate measures the speed at which a company consumes its cash reserves, serving as a critical health indicator for technology companies operating before or on the path to profitability. Distinguishing between gross and net burn rate, calculating runway accurately, and interpreting burn rate in the context of growth trajectory and market conditions are essential skills for technology professionals at every level. Managing burn rate effectively requires disciplined hiring, infrastructure cost optimization, phased investment, and continuous financial monitoring. When combined with revenue growth, unit economics, and margin analysis, burn rate provides the foundation for sound strategic decisions about when to invest aggressively, when to conserve, and when to raise additional capital.
