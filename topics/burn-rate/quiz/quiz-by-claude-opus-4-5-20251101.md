  <p>The rate at which the company is spending its cash reserves</p>
  <p>Burn rate measures how quickly a company is "burning through" its cash. It is calculated by tracking monthly expenses against available cash reserves, which helps investors estimate how long the company can continue operating before running out of cash (its runway). This metric is particularly critical for startups that rely heavily on cash reserves to fund operations and growth.</p>
