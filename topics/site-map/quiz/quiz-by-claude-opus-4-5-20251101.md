  <p>To provide a visual representation of a website's hierarchical structure and help users navigate the site's content</p>
  <p>A site map serves multiple important functions: it helps users navigate the site by providing a clear overview of content organization, improves search engine optimization by helping search engines index and rank the site more accurately, and streamlines website design by helping designers plan and organize the site's structure.
