  <p>A model where for every product sold, a similar product is donated to someone in need</p>
  <p>Blake Mycoskie created the "one for one" business model with TOMS Shoes, where for every pair of shoes sold, a pair of shoes is donated to a child in need. This approach integrates social impact directly into the core business transaction, making giving automatic with every purchase rather than relying on separate charitable donations or profit-sharing arrangements.</p>
