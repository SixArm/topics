# Supervised learning

Question: What distinguishes supervised learning from other types of machine learning?

- [ ] The algorithm generates its own training data through simulation
- [ ] The model learns patterns from unlabeled data without any guidance
- [ ] The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset where each input is paired with its corresponding output
- [ ] The model improves through trial and error with reward signals

  <p>The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset where each input is paired with its corresponding output</p>
  <p>Supervised learning is defined by its use of labeled training data, where each input data point has an associated output or target value. This labeled dataset enables the algorithm to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs, which it then uses to make predictions on new, unseen data. This contrasts with unsupervised learning (unlabeled data), reinforcement learning (reward signals), and self-supervised learning (generated labels).</p>
