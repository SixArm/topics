  <p>To store and analyze large amounts of historical data for business intelligence and reporting</p>
  <p>A data warehouse is specifically designed as a centralized repository that stores large amounts of historical data from various sources. Unlike transactional databases that handle day-to-day operations, data warehouses are optimized for query performance and complex analysis, supporting business intelligence activities such as reporting, OLAP analysis, and decision-making through features like drill-down, roll-up, and pivot table functionality.</p>
