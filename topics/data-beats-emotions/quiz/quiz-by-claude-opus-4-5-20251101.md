  <p>It provides an objective basis that reduces bias and clouded judgment</p>
  <p>Data-driven decision making provides an objective basis for decisions. By analyzing relevant data, leaders can gain a clearer understanding of situations, identify patterns or trends, and make more informed decisions. This is particularly important in complex or uncertain situations, where emotions or biases may cloud judgment. The principle doesn't eliminate the need for leadership or guarantee success, but it does help mitigate the risks of decisions driven purely by gut feelings.</p>
