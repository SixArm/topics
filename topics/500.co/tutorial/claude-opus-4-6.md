# 500 Startups

500 Startups (500.co) is a globally recognized venture capital firm and startup accelerator headquartered in San Francisco, California. Founded in 2010 by Dave McClure, the firm has established itself as one of the most active early-stage investors in the world, providing seed funding, mentorship, operational support, and access to a vast network of investors, corporate partners, and entrepreneurs. With investments spanning more than 75 countries and over 2,500 portfolio companies, 500 Startups has played a significant role in shaping the global startup ecosystem and democratizing access to venture capital beyond traditional Silicon Valley networks.

## History and Origins

500 Startups was founded by Dave McClure, a serial entrepreneur and angel investor who previously worked at PayPal, Microsoft, and several other technology companies. McClure envisioned a venture fund that operated differently from the traditional VC model: instead of making a small number of large bets, the firm would invest modest amounts in a high volume of startups, embracing a data-driven, portfolio-diversification approach. The firm launched its first accelerator batch in 2010 and quickly grew into a multi-fund operation with a global footprint. In 2017, McClure stepped down from his management role, and the firm underwent leadership changes, eventually rebranding aspects of its operations. Despite organizational transitions, the firm has continued to expand its programs and investment activities.

## Investment Philosophy and Strategy

500 Startups distinguishes itself through a high-volume, diversified investment strategy. Rather than concentrating capital in a handful of startups, the firm invests in a large number of early-stage companies with relatively small check sizes. This approach is rooted in the belief that venture capital outcomes follow a power-law distribution, and that casting a wider net increases the likelihood of backing breakout successes.

| Attribute | 500 Startups Approach | Traditional VC Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Typical check size | $50,000 to $150,000 (seed) | $1 million to $10 million+ |
| Portfolio size | 2,500+ companies | 20 to 50 companies per fund |
| Stage focus | Pre-seed and seed | Series A and later |
| Geographic scope | 75+ countries | Primarily US/Europe |
| Selection model | High volume, data-driven | High conviction, relationship-driven |
| Follow-on strategy | Selective follow-on in top performers | Reserved capital for pro-rata |

This model allows 500 Startups to support a broad and diverse set of founders while managing risk through diversification. The firm has helped its portfolio companies collectively raise more than $15 billion in follow-on funding from later-stage investors.

## Accelerator Programs

500 Startups operates structured programs designed to help early-stage companies refine their products, develop go-to-market strategies, and prepare for fundraising. Key programs include:

- **Seed Program**: A four-month intensive accelerator for pre-seed and seed-stage startups. Participants receive funding, mentorship from experienced operators and investors, and access to workshops covering growth marketing, product development, fundraising, and company culture. The program culminates in a demo day where startups pitch to a curated audience of investors.
- **Growth Program**: Aimed at companies that have achieved initial traction and are looking to scale. This program focuses on growth marketing, customer acquisition, unit economics, and preparing for Series A fundraising.
- **Regional Programs**: 500 Startups has launched accelerator programs in various geographies, including Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Europe. These programs are tailored to local market conditions and help founders navigate region-specific challenges.
- **Conferences and Events**: The firm hosts events that connect entrepreneurs, investors, and industry experts worldwide, fostering cross-border collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Global Reach and Impact

One of the defining characteristics of 500 Startups is its commitment to global investing. While many venture firms concentrate their activity in Silicon Valley, New York, and a handful of other established hubs, 500 Startups has actively sought out founders in underserved markets across Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. The firm operates regional funds and has local teams positioned to identify promising startups that might be overlooked by US-centric investors. This global orientation has made 500 Startups one of the most geographically diverse venture portfolios in the world.

## Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives

500 Startups has been a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion within the startup and venture capital ecosystem. Notable initiatives include:

- **Women in Venture**: A program providing mentorship, funding, and community support to female entrepreneurs and investors, aimed at closing the gender gap in venture-backed startups.
- **Black and Latinx Founder Program**: A dedicated track offering funding, mentorship, and resources to underrepresented minority founders, addressing systemic disparities in access to startup capital.
- **Global Founder Outreach**: By investing across 75+ countries, the firm inherently broadens access to capital for founders outside traditional venture hubs.

These programs reflect a broader thesis that diverse teams and perspectives lead to better business outcomes and that expanding the pipeline of funded founders strengthens the overall innovation ecosystem.

## Notable Portfolio Companies

500 Startups has backed several companies that have gone on to achieve significant scale and recognition. While the firm's strategy is predicated on volume rather than individual bets, its portfolio includes companies across a wide range of industries that have collectively achieved billions of dollars in enterprise value. The firm's alumni network serves as a resource for current cohort participants, providing peer mentorship and business development opportunities.
