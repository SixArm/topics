# Linked list data structure

Question: What is a key advantage of linked lists over arrays?

- [ ] Linked lists store elements in contiguous memory locations
- [ ] Linked lists provide constant-time random access to elements
- [ ] Linked lists allow efficient insertions and deletions at any position
- [ ] Linked lists use less memory per element than arrays

  <p>Linked lists allow efficient insertions and deletions at any position</p>
  <p>Unlike arrays, which require shifting elements when inserting or deleting, linked lists only need to adjust pointers to add or remove nodes. This makes insertions and deletions efficient operations, particularly in the middle of the list. However, linked lists sacrifice constant-time random access (which arrays provide) and use additional memory for storing pointers.</p>
