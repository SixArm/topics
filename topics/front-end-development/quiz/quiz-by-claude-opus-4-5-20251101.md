  <p>JavaScript</p>
  <p>JavaScript is the programming language used in front-end development to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It handles user events, performs data validation, manipulates page content, and enables interactive features. While HTML provides structure and CSS handles styling, JavaScript is the technology that makes web pages respond to user actions and change dynamically without requiring a page reload.</p>
