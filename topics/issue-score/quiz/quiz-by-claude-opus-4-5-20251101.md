  <p>MoSCoW requirement</p>
  <p>The MoSCoW requirement scoring method categorizes issues as Must (essential), Should (important but not vital), Could (nice to have), and Won't (not needed now). This approach originated from product planning and helps teams prioritize issues based on business necessity rather than technical severity.</p>
