# Integration testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of integration testing?

- [ ] To test the user interface design for visual consistency
- [ ] To verify that individual functions work correctly in isolation
- [ ] To detect errors that arise from the interaction between different modules
- [ ] To measure the performance and response time of the application

  <p>To detect errors that arise from the interaction between different modules</p>
  <p>Integration testing specifically focuses on testing how different modules or components of an application work together. While unit testing verifies individual functions in isolation, integration testing ensures that when these modules are combined, they interact correctly and seamlessly. This helps catch errors caused by incompatible interfaces, incorrect data passing between modules, or integration-related defects before they reach end-users.</p>
