  <p>Awareness, Interest, Decision, Action</p>
  <p>A sales funnel follows the customer journey from initial contact to final purchase. It begins with Awareness (capturing attention through marketing), progresses to Interest (engaging with content and learning more), moves to Decision (considering a purchase and addressing objections), and concludes with Action (completing the purchase and becoming a customer). This sequence reflects how customers naturally move from discovering a product to buying it.</p>
