  <p>The perceived value and benefits to the customer</p>
  <p>Value-based pricing sets prices based on the perceived value to the customer, focusing on the benefits that the product or service provides—such as increased productivity, improved quality of life, or reduced costs—rather than the cost of production. This approach allows businesses to capture more of the value they create and increase profitability.</p>
