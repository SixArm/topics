  <p>To develop self-sufficient teams that can continuously adapt and improve without heavy reliance on external coaching</p>
  <p>The ultimate goal of agile coaching is to build team autonomy and capability. An effective agile coach works to empower teams to self-organize, continuously improve, and eventually operate independently. The coach's role evolves as teams mature—transitioning from hands-on guidance to strategic coaching—with the aim of embedding experimentation, learning from failures, and continuous improvement into the team's culture. Success is achieved when teams no longer need heavy external coaching to thrive.</p>
