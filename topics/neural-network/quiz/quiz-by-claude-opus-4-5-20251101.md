# Neural network

Question: What is the purpose of activation functions in a neural network?

- [ ] To store the training data within the network layers
- [ ] To introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to model complex relationships in data
- [ ] To reduce the number of neurons required in hidden layers
- [ ] To convert the output layer directly into human-readable text

  <p>To introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to model complex relationships in data</p>
  <p>Activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh introduce non-linearity to neuron outputs. Without activation functions, a neural network would only be able to learn linear relationships, regardless of how many layers it has. Non-linearity allows the network to approximate complex patterns and functions in the data.</p>
