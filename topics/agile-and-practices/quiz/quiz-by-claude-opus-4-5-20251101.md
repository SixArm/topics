  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Waterfall documentation</p>
  <p>Agile methodologies integrate with practices such as artificial intelligence, product management, programme management, UI/UX design, and test automation. Waterfall documentation, which emphasizes extensive upfront documentation, contradicts Agile's principle of valuing "working software over comprehensive documentation" and is not a practice that aligns with Agile approaches.</p>
