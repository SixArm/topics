  <p>It enhances maintainability, flexibility, and reusability of web pages</p>
  <p>CSS works by separating the presentation of a web page from its structure and content. Instead of embedding styling directly in HTML markup, developers can define styles in separate CSS files or within style tags. This separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain code, provides flexibility to change styles without modifying content, and enables reuse of style rules across multiple pages and projects.</p>
