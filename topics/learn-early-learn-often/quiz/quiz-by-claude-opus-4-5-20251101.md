  <p>It allows teams to quickly identify and correct errors in assumptions before changes become difficult and expensive</p>
  <p>The "learn early, learn often" philosophy, closely tied to lean startup methodology, emphasizes rapid experimentation and iteration to validate or invalidate assumptions early in development. By learning early and continuously, teams can refine their products, make data-driven decisions, and avoid costly mistakes that would be much harder to fix later in the process.</p>
