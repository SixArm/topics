# Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG)

Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG) is a highly respected consulting and advisory firm founded by Marty Cagan, a veteran product leader.

SVPG’s core concepts relating to Agile:

- **Continuous discovery:** Test ideas early and often with real customers and real users.

- **Dual-Track Agile:** Use agile for discovery (testing ideas) and for delivery (building ideas).

- **Product Triad:** Strong collaboration between Product Manager, Designer, and Tech Lead.

- **Outcomes Over Output:** Success is measured by solving customer problems, not shipping features.

- **Vision & Mission:** Agile doesn’t say much about these — SVPG fills that gap.

- **Inspired:** How to Create Tech Products Customers Love

- **Empowered:** Ordinary People, Extraordinary Products
