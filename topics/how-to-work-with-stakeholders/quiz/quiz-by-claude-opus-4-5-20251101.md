  <p>Act as a mediator, facilitating constructive discussions and finding win-win solutions early</p>
  <p>Effective stakeholder management requires addressing conflicts proactively before they escalate. Acting as a mediator allows you to facilitate constructive discussions that seek mutually beneficial outcomes, preserving relationships and keeping the project on track. Ignoring conflicts, automatically escalating, or taking sides can damage trust and derail project success.</p>
