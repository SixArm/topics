  <p>Higher profit margins by eliminating middlemen and retailers</p>
  <p>The direct sales model allows companies to earn higher profit margins because they bypass intermediaries such as distributors and retailers. This means the company retains more revenue from each sale, which can contribute to greater financial success. The other options are incorrect: direct sales typically involves commission-based compensation which increases turnover risk, scalability is actually a challenge in this model, and building strong customer relationships is a core requirement of direct sales.</p>
