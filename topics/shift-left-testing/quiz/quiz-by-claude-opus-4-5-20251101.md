# Shift-left testing

Question: What is the primary goal of shift-left testing in software development?

- [ ] To delay testing until after the code is deployed to production
- [ ] To replace manual testing entirely with automated testing tools
- [ ] To identify and fix defects early in the development lifecycle before they become costly
- [ ] To shift testing responsibilities from QA teams to external contractors

  <p>To identify and fix defects early in the development lifecycle before they become costly</p>
  <p>Shift-left testing moves testing activities earlier ("left" on the timeline) in the software development process. By detecting and correcting defects as code is being written—through techniques like unit testing, code reviews, static analysis, and continuous integration—teams can fix issues before they become more expensive and time-consuming to address later in development.</p>
