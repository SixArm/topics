# Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

Question: What does it mean when the IRR of an investment equals the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) equal to zero?

- [ ] The investment will generate returns below the cost of capital
- [ ] The present value of cash inflows exactly equals the present value of cash outflows
- [ ] The investment should be immediately rejected
- [ ] The cash flows have been adjusted for inflation

  <p>The present value of cash inflows exactly equals the present value of cash outflows</p>
  <p>The IRR is defined as the discount rate at which the NPV equals zero, meaning the discounted cash inflows match the discounted cash outflows. This break-even point helps investors determine if a project meets their minimum required rate of return—if the IRR exceeds the cost of capital, the investment is expected to be profitable.</p>
