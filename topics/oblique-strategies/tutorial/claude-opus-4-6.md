# Oblique Strategies

Oblique Strategies is a creative problem-solving method originally developed by musician Brian Eno and artist Peter Schmidt in 1975. It uses a deck of printed cards, each bearing a short, deliberately ambiguous prompt or aphorism designed to disrupt habitual thinking patterns and stimulate lateral approaches to challenges. While born in the arts, the method has become a valued tool in technology, product development, and engineering contexts where teams face creative blocks, design paralysis, or decision fatigue.

## Origins and History

Brian Eno, known for pioneering ambient music and producing landmark albums for artists like David Bowie, Talking Heads, and U2, developed the concept alongside painter Peter Schmidt. Both men had independently created personal lists of principles they would consult when stuck during creative work. In 1975, they combined and formalized these lists into a published card deck. The original edition contained 113 cards. Subsequent editions appeared in 1978, 1979, and 2001, each adding, removing, or revising prompts. The concept predates modern design thinking and agile methodologies, yet it addresses the same core challenge: how to move forward productively when conventional approaches fail.

## How It Works

The method is straightforward. A participant draws a card at random from the deck and reads the prompt aloud. The prompt is then applied to whatever problem, project, or decision is at hand. The key is that the prompts are intentionally vague and non-prescriptive, forcing the participant to interpret and contextualize the instruction within their own situation.

There is no single correct way to use the cards. Common approaches include:

- **Random draw**: Pull a single card when stuck and use its prompt as a constraint or lens for the next phase of work.
- **Deliberate selection**: Browse the deck and choose a card that resonates with a particular challenge.
- **Group facilitation**: Use cards as discussion starters in brainstorming sessions, retrospectives, or design critiques.
- **Time-boxed constraint**: Apply the card's instruction for a fixed period, such as 15 or 30 minutes, then evaluate the results.

## Notable Card Examples

The power of Oblique Strategies lies in the cards themselves. Each prompt is concise but open to wide interpretation. The following table presents representative examples and how a technology professional might apply them.

| Card Prompt | Possible Application in Technology |
|---|---|
| "Use an old idea" | Revisit a previously rejected architecture or algorithm that may now be viable given new constraints |
| "Emphasize the flaws" | Instead of hiding a system limitation, make it a visible feature and design around it |
| "Do nothing for as long as possible" | Defer a premature optimization or feature decision until more data is available |
| "What would your closest friend do?" | Step outside your own expertise bias and consider how a non-specialist would approach the interface |
| "Honor thy error as a hidden intention" | Investigate an unexpected test result or bug as a potential source of insight |
| "Remove specifics and convert to ambiguities" | Abstract a tightly coupled component into a more general-purpose interface |
| "State the problem in words as clearly as possible" | Write a clear problem statement before jumping into implementation |
| "Turn it upside down" | Invert your assumptions about who the user is, what the primary use case is, or which layer owns the logic |
| "Only one element of each kind" | Reduce redundancy in a system by eliminating duplicate services, schemas, or data stores |

## Why It Works: Cognitive Principles

Oblique Strategies draws its effectiveness from several well-established cognitive and creative principles:

- **Lateral thinking**: Coined by Edward de Bono, lateral thinking involves approaching problems indirectly rather than through conventional linear logic. The cards force a sideways jump in reasoning.
- **Constraint-driven creativity**: Research consistently shows that imposing arbitrary constraints paradoxically increases creative output. A random card provides just such a constraint.
- **Pattern interruption**: Habitual thinking follows neural pathways that become deeply grooved over time. An unexpected prompt disrupts these pathways and opens alternative routes.
- **Reframing**: Many cards implicitly ask the user to redefine the problem itself rather than generate another solution to the existing framing.
- **Psychological safety**: Because the card is random and impersonal, it gives participants permission to suggest ideas they might otherwise self-censor. The card, not the person, is the source of the potentially unconventional suggestion.

## Applications in Technology and Engineering

While Oblique Strategies originated in music and art, its principles translate directly to technology work. The following areas benefit most:

- **Product design and UX**: When a design team is cycling through incremental variations without breakthrough, a card draw can redirect attention to overlooked dimensions of the problem such as edge cases, emotional tone, or accessibility.
- **Software architecture**: Architectural decisions often suffer from anchoring bias, where the first proposed approach dominates discussion. A card like "Reverse" or "What is the reality of the situation?" can force a team to genuinely consider alternatives.
- **Debugging and incident response**: Cards that encourage honoring errors or examining flaws align naturally with blameless postmortem culture and root cause analysis.
- **Agile retrospectives**: Oblique Strategies cards serve as excellent retrospective prompts, providing a fresh angle that avoids the staleness of repeated "what went well / what didn't" formats.
- **Innovation workshops and hackathons**: Using cards as ideation constraints during time-boxed innovation events introduces productive randomness.

## Comparison with Other Creative Methods

Oblique Strategies is one of several structured creativity techniques. The following table compares it with other commonly used methods in technology contexts.

| Method | Structure | Group or Individual | Primary Mechanism | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Oblique Strategies | Random prompt cards | Both | Lateral constraint | Breaking blocks, reframing problems |
| Design Thinking | Five-phase framework | Group | Empathy-driven iteration | User-centered product development |
| SCAMPER | Seven structured prompts | Both | Systematic modification | Improving existing products or features |
| Six Thinking Hats | Role-based perspectives | Group | Parallel thinking | Structured group decision-making |
| Brainstorming | Freeform idea generation | Group | Volume of ideas | Early-stage ideation |
| Mind Mapping | Visual branching | Individual | Associative thinking | Exploring problem spaces |

The distinguishing characteristic of Oblique Strategies is its embrace of randomness and ambiguity. Unlike methods with defined steps or frameworks, it deliberately avoids prescribing a process, relying instead on the participant's ability to make meaning from an unexpected prompt.

## Implementing Oblique Strategies in Your Workflow

Adopting Oblique Strategies does not require purchasing the original card deck, though physical cards remain available. Several practical implementation options exist:

- **Physical card deck**: The original deck is periodically reprinted and available from specialty retailers. Physical cards work well in co-located team settings.
- **Digital tools**: Numerous web applications and mobile apps present random Oblique Strategies prompts. These are convenient for remote teams and individual use.
- **Custom decks**: Teams can create their own domain-specific oblique strategies tailored to their technology stack, organizational culture, or product domain. This is a valuable team-building exercise in its own right.
- **Integration into ceremonies**: Add a card draw as a standing element of sprint planning, design reviews, or retrospectives. Consistency of use builds comfort with the method over time.

## Limitations and Considerations

Oblique Strategies is not a universal solution. It works best when participants are already deeply engaged with a problem and have domain expertise to draw upon. The prompts provide a catalyst, not a substitute for knowledge. Teams new to the method may initially find the ambiguity frustrating rather than liberating, so introducing it gradually and in low-stakes contexts is advisable. Additionally, the method is most effective for divergent thinking phases of work and less suited to convergent phases where decisions must be narrowed and finalized.

## Related

Professionals interested in Oblique Strategies should also explore lateral thinking as formalized by Edward de Bono, design thinking as a structured innovation methodology, SCAMPER technique for systematic idea modification, brainstorming and brainwriting for group ideation, creative thinking techniques more broadly, mind mapping for visual problem exploration, and agile retrospective formats that incorporate novel facilitation approaches.

## Summary

Oblique Strategies is a deceptively simple but powerful creative problem-solving tool that uses random, ambiguous prompts to break habitual thinking patterns and open new avenues of exploration. Originating in the arts, it has proven equally valuable in technology and engineering contexts where teams face design blocks, architectural anchoring, or innovation fatigue. Its strength lies in its embrace of constraint and randomness as catalysts for creativity, and its low overhead makes it easy to integrate into existing workflows, from agile ceremonies to individual debugging sessions.
