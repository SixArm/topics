  <p>To stimulate lateral thinking and break free from conventional problem-solving approaches</p>
  <p>Oblique Strategies, created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt in the 1970s, consists of cards with intentionally ambiguous aphorisms and prompts designed to help individuals break out of creative ruts and explore new possibilities. The cards encourage approaching problems from different angles rather than following conventional or habitual patterns of thinking.</p>
