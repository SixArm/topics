  <p>Starting with a clear sense of purpose and values</p>
  <p>Simon Sinek argues that companies with a strong "why" — a clear sense of purpose and values — are more likely to succeed than those that focus only on "what" they do. This principle helps organizations inspire loyalty, attract talent, and differentiate themselves in the market by communicating the deeper reason behind their work.</p>
