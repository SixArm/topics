  <p>Admit it quickly and emphatically</p>
  <p>Carnegie teaches that when you are wrong, admitting it quickly and emphatically disarms the other person and demonstrates integrity. This principle is essential for technology professionals who work in collaborative environments where acknowledging mistakes promptly—whether in code reviews, project decisions, or technical discussions—builds trust and accelerates problem resolution rather than prolonging conflicts.</p>
