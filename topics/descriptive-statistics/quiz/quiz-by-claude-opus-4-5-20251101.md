  <p>Measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion</p>
  <p>Descriptive statistics is divided into measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) which describe the typical or central value of a dataset, and measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation) which describe the variability or spread of the data. These two categories together provide a comprehensive summary of a dataset's main features.</p>
