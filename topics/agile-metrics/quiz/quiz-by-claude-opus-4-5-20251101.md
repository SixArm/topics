  <p>Lead time</p>
  <p>Lead time measures the total duration from when a feature is requested until it is delivered to customers. This differs from cycle time, which only tracks the time from when development begins until completion. Understanding lead time helps teams assess overall responsiveness to customer needs and identify delays in the entire workflow, including any queuing time before work starts.</p>
