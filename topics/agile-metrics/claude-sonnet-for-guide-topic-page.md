# Agile metrics

Agile metrics are essential measurement tools that help software development teams track progress, identify bottlenecks, and continuously improve their processes. These metrics focus on delivering value to customers while maintaining team efficiency and product quality throughout iterative development cycles.

* **Customer satisfaction metrics**, such as Net Promoter Score or user feedback ratings, ensure that technical improvements align with user needs.

* **Team health metrics** focus on sustainability and collaboration. These include team satisfaction surveys, retrospective action item completion rates, and knowledge sharing indicators. Monitoring these aspects prevents burnout and maintains long-term productivity.

* **Quality metrics** include defect rates, code coverage, and technical debt measurements. Tracking bugs found in production versus those caught during development helps teams assess their testing effectiveness and overall code quality.

* **Cycle time** tracks the time from when development begins until completion. These metrics help teams optimize their processes and set realistic customer expectations.

* **Velocity** measures the amount of work a team completes during each sprint or iteration. Teams typically measure velocity in story points or hours, providing valuable insights for sprint planning and release forecasting.

* **Burndown charts** complement velocity by visualizing remaining work over time, helping teams identify whether they're on track to meet sprint goals.

* **Lead time** measures the duration from when a feature is requested until it's delivered to customers.
