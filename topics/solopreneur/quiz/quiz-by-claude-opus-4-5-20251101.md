  <p>Complete control over business decisions without needing partner or investor approval</p>
  <p>One of the key advantages of being a solopreneur is the freedom to create and run a business according to your own values and priorities. Solopreneurs have complete control over their business and can make decisions quickly without the need for approval from partners or investors. This autonomy allows for faster decision-making and alignment with personal goals, though it comes with trade-offs such as higher burnout risk and scaling challenges.</p>
