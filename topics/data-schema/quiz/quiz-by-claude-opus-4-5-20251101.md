  <p>To define the structure, organization, and relationships among data elements</p>
  <p>A data schema serves as the blueprint of a database, defining how data is organized, stored, and related. It describes data elements (including data types, sizes, and formats), establishes relationships among tables using primary and foreign keys, and provides a framework for ensuring data integrity and consistency. The schema is created using a data definition language (DDL) such as SQL and can be modified as business requirements evolve.</p>
