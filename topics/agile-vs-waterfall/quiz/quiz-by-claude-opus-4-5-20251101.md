  <p>Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process while agile embraces iterative development through short sprints</p>
  <p>Waterfall progresses through requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance in a rigid order where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Agile methodology works in cycles (typically two to four weeks), continuously delivering working software increments while adapting to changing requirements. This fundamental structural difference affects how teams plan, collaborate, and respond to change throughout a project.</p>
