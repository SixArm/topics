# Agile vs waterfall

Agile and waterfall represent two fundamentally different approaches to software development, each with distinct methodologies and philosophies. Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Teams progress through requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance in a rigid order. This approach emphasizes comprehensive documentation and detailed upfront planning, making it suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes.

In contrast, agile methodology embraces iterative development through short sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. Teams work in cycles, continuously delivering working software increments while adapting to changing requirements. Agile prioritizes individuals and interactions over processes, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.

The key advantages of waterfall include predictable timelines, clear milestones, and thorough documentation, making it ideal for regulated industries or projects with fixed scope. However, it struggles with changing requirements and provides limited customer feedback until late in the development cycle.

Agile excels in dynamic environments where requirements evolve frequently. It enables faster delivery of value, promotes customer satisfaction through regular feedback, and allows teams to respond quickly to market changes. The approach fosters better team collaboration and reduces the risk of delivering unwanted features.

However, agile can be challenging for organizations requiring extensive documentation or fixed budgets. It demands high customer involvement and may struggle with large, complex projects requiring significant upfront architecture decisions. The choice between agile and waterfall ultimately depends on project requirements, organizational culture, customer needs, and the level of uncertainty in the project scope.
