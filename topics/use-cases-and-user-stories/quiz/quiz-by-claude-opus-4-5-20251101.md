  <p>Use cases are more detailed and comprehensive, while user stories are shorter statements focused on user needs and outcomes</p>
  <p>Use cases provide detailed descriptions of how users interact with a system, often represented as diagrams or flowcharts showing specific steps and outcomes. User stories are short, simple statements written in the format "As a [type of user], I want [some feature], so that [some benefit]." This difference in detail level also reflects their typical usage: use cases are common in traditional Waterfall processes, while user stories are favored in Agile development for iterative requirement gathering.</p>
