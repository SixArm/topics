  <p>Venture capital comes from institutional investors and targets startups ready to scale, while angel investors are individuals who typically invest in early-stage startups</p>
  <p>Angel investors are high net worth individuals who invest in startups in the early stages of development, exchanging capital for equity. Venture capital involves raising funds from institutional investors (such as VC firms) in exchange for equity, and is typically reserved for startups that have a proven business model and are ready to scale. Understanding this distinction helps technology professionals identify the appropriate funding source based on their company's stage of development.</p>
