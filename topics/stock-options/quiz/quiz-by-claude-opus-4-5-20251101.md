  <p>NSOs are taxed at ordinary income rates when exercised, while ISOs may qualify for long-term capital gains rates if holding requirements are met</p>
  <p>The primary distinction between ISOs and NSOs is their tax treatment. ISOs can be taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains rate if the employee holds the shares for at least two years after the grant date and one year after exercise. NSOs are subject to ordinary income tax rates at the time of exercise, which are typically higher. This tax difference can significantly impact the net value of stock option compensation for technology professionals.</p>
