# Stock options

Stock options are a type of financial instrument that grants an employee the right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares of company stock at a predetermined price within a specified timeframe. They are one of the most common forms of equity compensation in the technology industry, used by companies ranging from early-stage startups to publicly traded enterprises. For technology professionals, understanding stock options is essential because they can represent a significant portion of total compensation, sometimes exceeding base salary in value. Stock options align employee incentives with company performance: when the company grows, the value of the options grows with it.

## How stock options work

When a company grants stock options to an employee, it specifies several key terms: the number of shares covered, the exercise price (also called the strike price), the vesting schedule, and the expiration date. The exercise price is typically set at the fair market value of the company's stock on the date of the grant. The employee does not pay anything at the time of the grant. Instead, the option gives the employee the right to buy shares at that locked-in exercise price at a future date, after the options have vested.

If the company's stock price rises above the exercise price, the options are said to be "in the money," and the employee can exercise them to buy shares at a discount to the current market price. The difference between the market price and the exercise price is the employee's gain. If the stock price falls below the exercise price, the options are "underwater" and have no immediate economic value, though they may regain value if the stock price recovers before the expiration date.

## Key terminology

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| Grant date | The date the company awards the stock options to the employee |
| Exercise price (strike price) | The fixed price at which the employee can purchase shares |
| Vesting schedule | The timeline over which the employee earns the right to exercise options |
| Cliff | An initial period (often one year) before any options vest |
| Exercise | The act of purchasing shares at the exercise price |
| Expiration date | The deadline by which options must be exercised or they become worthless |
| Fair market value (FMV) | The current appraised value of the company's stock |
| In the money | When the current stock price exceeds the exercise price |
| Underwater | When the exercise price exceeds the current stock price |
| 409A valuation | An independent appraisal of private company stock used to set the exercise price |

## Incentive stock options versus non-qualified stock options

There are two main types of stock options, each with distinct tax treatment and eligibility rules. The choice between them affects both the company and the employee.

| Feature | Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) | Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs) |
|---|---|---|
| Eligibility | Employees only | Employees, contractors, advisors, board members |
| Tax at exercise | No ordinary income tax at exercise (but may trigger AMT) | Ordinary income tax on the spread at exercise |
| Tax at sale | Long-term capital gains if holding periods are met | Ordinary income on spread; capital gains on additional appreciation |
| Holding period requirement | Must hold shares 2 years from grant and 1 year from exercise for favorable treatment | No special holding period required |
| Annual grant limit | $100,000 worth of options (by exercise price) may vest per year | No statutory limit |
| Company tax deduction | Generally none | Company can deduct the spread as a compensation expense |

For technology professionals, ISOs are generally more tax-advantageous when the holding period requirements are satisfied, because the gain is taxed at long-term capital gains rates rather than ordinary income rates. However, the spread at exercise may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), which can create an unexpected tax liability. NSOs are simpler in their tax treatment but result in higher taxes at exercise since the spread is treated as ordinary income.

## Vesting schedules

Most stock option grants in the technology industry follow a four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff. This means:

- No options vest during the first year of employment.
- After the one-year cliff, 25% of the total grant vests at once.
- The remaining 75% vests in equal monthly or quarterly installments over the next three years.
- Full vesting is achieved after four years of continuous employment.

Some companies use alternative vesting structures, such as three-year vesting, back-weighted vesting (where more options vest in later years), or milestone-based vesting tied to performance targets. The vesting schedule is designed to incentivize retention: if an employee leaves before options are fully vested, the unvested portion is typically forfeited.

## Exercising stock options

When an employee decides to exercise their vested options, they must pay the exercise price multiplied by the number of shares they wish to purchase. There are several common methods of exercise:

- **Cash exercise**: The employee pays the full exercise price out of pocket and receives the shares. This is common at private companies where there is no public market to sell shares immediately.
- **Cashless exercise (same-day sale)**: Available at public companies, the employee exercises and simultaneously sells enough shares to cover the exercise price and applicable taxes, keeping any remaining shares or cash.
- **Net exercise**: The company withholds a portion of the shares to cover the exercise price, delivering only the net shares to the employee.

At private companies, exercising options requires careful consideration because the shares may be illiquid. There is no guarantee of a future liquidity event (such as an IPO or acquisition), and the employee is putting real money at risk.

## Tax implications for technology professionals

Tax treatment of stock options is one of the most consequential aspects of equity compensation. The key tax events and their implications are:

- **At grant**: No tax event occurs for either ISOs or NSOs.
- **At exercise (ISOs)**: No regular income tax, but the spread (FMV minus exercise price) may be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. This can result in a large, unexpected tax bill, particularly if the spread is significant.
- **At exercise (NSOs)**: The spread is taxed as ordinary income, and the company withholds income and payroll taxes.
- **At sale (ISOs with qualifying disposition)**: If the holding period requirements are met (two years from grant, one year from exercise), the entire gain from the exercise price to the sale price is taxed at long-term capital gains rates.
- **At sale (ISOs with disqualifying disposition)**: If the holding periods are not met, the spread at exercise is recharacterized as ordinary income, and only additional appreciation is taxed as capital gains.
- **At sale (NSOs)**: Any appreciation above the FMV at exercise is taxed as capital gains (short-term or long-term depending on holding period).

Technology professionals at startups should pay particular attention to the Section 83(b) election, which applies to early exercise of unvested options. Filing an 83(b) election within 30 days of exercise allows the employee to pay tax on the spread at the time of exercise rather than at vesting, potentially resulting in significant tax savings if the stock appreciates substantially.

## Stock options at startups versus public companies

The experience of holding stock options differs considerably depending on the company stage.

| Factor | Startup (Private Company) | Public Company |
|---|---|---|
| Liquidity | Shares are illiquid; no public market to sell | Shares can be sold on the open market |
| Valuation certainty | FMV set by 409A valuation; actual value uncertain | Market price is transparent and updated continuously |
| Risk profile | Higher risk; company may fail or never reach liquidity | Lower risk; stock has established market value |
| Upside potential | Potentially very large if company succeeds | Typically more moderate and predictable |
| Exercise timing pressure | Must decide whether to exercise before expiration or departure | Cashless exercise reduces financial risk |
| Post-termination exercise period | Often 90 days after departure (some companies offer longer) | Typically 90 days, but cashless exercise mitigates risk |

For startup employees, the decision to exercise options often involves weighing a real cash outlay (plus potential tax liability) against an uncertain future payoff. Many technology professionals have benefited enormously from startup stock options, but many others have exercised options in companies that ultimately failed, losing both the exercise cost and the taxes paid.

## Common pitfalls and considerations

- **Letting options expire**: Options have a finite life, typically ten years from the grant date. Employees who leave a company usually have only 90 days to exercise vested options before they expire, though some companies have extended this to several years.
- **Concentration risk**: Holding a large portion of net worth in a single company's stock is inherently risky. Diversification should be considered as soon as liquidity permits.
- **AMT surprise**: Exercising ISOs with a large spread can trigger AMT liability even though no cash has been received. Employees should model their AMT exposure before exercising.
- **Underwater options**: If the stock price drops below the exercise price, the options have no intrinsic value. Some companies address this through option repricing or exchange programs.
- **Dilution**: Additional funding rounds, new option grants, and other equity issuances can dilute the percentage ownership represented by existing options.
- **Tax withholding shortfalls**: For NSOs, the tax withholding at exercise may not cover the full tax liability, requiring estimated tax payments.

Technology professionals working with stock options should also explore related topics including restricted stock units (RSUs), employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), 409A valuations, capitalization tables, equity financing, vesting schedules, the Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), liquidation preferences, and dilution. Understanding these interconnected concepts provides a complete picture of equity compensation and startup finance.

## Summary

Stock options give technology professionals the right to purchase company shares at a fixed price, offering significant upside when a company grows in value. The two primary types, ISOs and NSOs, differ in tax treatment, eligibility, and strategic considerations. Vesting schedules ensure long-term alignment between employee and company interests. While stock options can be a powerful wealth-building tool, particularly at high-growth startups, they carry real risks including illiquidity, tax complexity, concentration risk, and the possibility that options expire worthless. A technology professional should evaluate stock options as part of their total compensation, model the tax implications before exercising, and seek professional tax advice when the amounts are material.
