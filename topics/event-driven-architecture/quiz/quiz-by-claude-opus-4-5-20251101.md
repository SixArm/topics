# Event-driven architecture (EDA)

Question: What is a key architectural benefit of event-driven architecture (EDA) that makes systems more modular and easier to maintain?

- [ ] It requires a central control mechanism to coordinate all components
- [ ] It tightly integrates components for faster direct communication
- [ ] It decouples different components of a system
- [ ] It eliminates the need for event channels between producers and consumers

  <p>It decouples different components of a system</p>
  <p>Event-driven architecture decouples system components by having them communicate through events rather than direct connections. This decoupling makes components more modular, allows them to be developed and deployed independently, enables greater scalability when adding new components, and simplifies maintenance since changes to one component don't require changes to others.</p>
