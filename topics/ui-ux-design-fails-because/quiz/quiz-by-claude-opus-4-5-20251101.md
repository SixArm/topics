  <p>Designs that don't resonate with the target audience due to assumptions made without proper user research</p>
  <p>Poor user research is a foundational failure in UI/UX design. When designers skip proper research and analysis, they make assumptions about user needs, behaviors, and preferences. This leads to designs that fail to connect with the actual target audience. While performance issues, visual inconsistency, and unclear CTAs are all valid concerns, they are typically symptoms that can be identified and corrected through testing—whereas building on flawed assumptions from the start creates fundamental misalignment between the product and its users.</p>
