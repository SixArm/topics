  <p>To measure learner achievement against predetermined criteria at the end of an instructional period</p>
  <p>Summative assessment is specifically designed to evaluate what learners have mastered at the conclusion of an instructional period. Unlike formative assessment (which provides ongoing feedback during learning) or diagnostic assessment (which identifies gaps before instruction), summative assessment provides a final judgment of performance against established standards and is typically graded to determine outcomes like certification, promotion, or course completion.</p>
