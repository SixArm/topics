  <p>Franchising</p>
  <p>Franchising grants rights to operate under a brand and business model to independent franchisees. This enables rapid expansion by leveraging the franchisees' capital and local knowledge while the parent company maintains control over the brand, standards, and business processes. Unlike licensing (which focuses on intellectual property rights) or organic growth (which is slower and internally driven), franchising specifically balances rapid scaling with brand consistency.</p>
