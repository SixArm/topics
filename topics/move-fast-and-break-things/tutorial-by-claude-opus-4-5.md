## Move Fast and Break Things

"Move fast and break things" is a philosophy that prioritizes speed and innovation over avoiding mistakes. Coined by Mark Zuckerberg during Facebook's early years, this mantra became synonymous with Silicon Valley startup culture and shaped how an entire generation of technology companies approached product development.

## Origins and Core Philosophy

The phrase emerged from Facebook's internal culture in the late 2000s. Zuckerberg believed that the greatest risk wasn't making mistakes—it was moving too slowly and being overtaken by competitors. The philosophy rests on several core assumptions:

- **Speed creates competitive advantage**: First movers can capture markets before incumbents react
- **Failure is educational**: Each mistake provides data that informs better decisions
- **Perfection is the enemy of progress**: Waiting for flawless products means missing opportunities
- **Users will tolerate rough edges**: Early adopters value novelty over polish

This approach encourages teams to ship minimum viable products, gather real-world feedback, and iterate rapidly rather than spending extended periods in development before launch.

## When This Approach Works

The philosophy proves effective in specific contexts:

| Condition | Why It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Greenfield markets | No established expectations to violate |
| Low-stakes failures | Bugs cause inconvenience, not harm |
| Strong feedback loops | Rapid user input enables quick correction |
| Reversible decisions | Changes can be rolled back easily |
| Technical debt is acceptable | Short-term velocity matters more than architecture |

Consumer apps, social features, and internal tools often benefit from this approach. When the cost of being wrong is low and the cost of being slow is high, aggressive iteration makes strategic sense.

## When This Approach Fails

The philosophy becomes dangerous when applied indiscriminately:

| Context | Risk |
|---------|------|
| Healthcare and medical devices | Patient safety compromised |
| Financial systems | Monetary losses, regulatory violations |
| Autonomous vehicles | Physical harm to people |
| Privacy-sensitive applications | Irreversible data exposure |
| Critical infrastructure | Cascading system failures |

Breaking things in these domains causes real harm that cannot be patched with a software update.

## The Evolution Away from "Move Fast"

By 2014, Facebook itself had abandoned the slogan, replacing it with "Move fast with stable infrastructure." This shift reflected several realizations:

- **Technical debt accumulates**: Rapid development creates fragile systems that slow future progress
- **Trust is difficult to rebuild**: Users who experience repeated failures eventually leave
- **Regulatory scrutiny increases**: Broken things attract government attention
- **Scale amplifies mistakes**: Bugs affecting billions of users create massive negative impact
- **Ethical responsibilities matter**: Companies influence society in ways that demand care

The Cambridge Analytica scandal, misinformation crises, and mental health concerns demonstrated that "breaking things" at Facebook's scale had profound societal consequences.

## Criticisms of the Philosophy

Technology critics have raised substantial objections:

- **Externalizes costs**: Companies capture benefits of speed while users bear costs of failures
- **Privileges growth over responsibility**: Ethics become an afterthought rather than a design constraint
- **Creates harmful power asymmetries**: Users cannot opt out of being experimented upon
- **Normalizes recklessness**: Engineers learn to deprioritize careful thinking
- **Ignores systemic effects**: Individual "small" breakages compound into major problems

The philosophy assumes that all failures are recoverable and all stakeholders are willing participants—assumptions that often prove false.

## Alternative Approaches

Modern technology organizations have developed more nuanced philosophies:

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Move fast with guardrails | Maintain velocity while protecting critical paths |
| Fail safely | Design systems so failures have bounded impact |
| Progressive rollouts | Test changes with small user populations first |
| Reversibility by default | Ensure all changes can be undone |
| Blameless postmortems | Learn from failures without punishing individuals |

These approaches preserve the benefits of iteration while reducing harm.

## Practical Guidelines for Technology Professionals

When deciding how aggressively to iterate, consider:

- **What breaks when this fails?** Distinguish between inconvenience and harm
- **Who bears the cost of failure?** Ensure those affected consent to the risk
- **Can we detect problems quickly?** Monitoring and alerting enable fast response
- **Can we reverse the change?** Rollback capability bounds the blast radius
- **What's the regulatory environment?** Some industries mandate caution

Speed remains valuable, but it must be balanced against the nature and distribution of potential harms.

## Conclusion

"Move fast and break things" captured something real about competitive advantage in nascent technology markets. However, as software systems have become critical infrastructure woven into every aspect of society, the philosophy has revealed its limitations. The most successful technology organizations today move fast where appropriate, but recognize that some things should never be broken. Maturity means understanding the difference.
