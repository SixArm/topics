  <p>Complex Domain</p>
  <p>The Complex Domain is characterized by unknown unknowns, where multiple factors interact and influence outcomes in unpredictable ways. Unlike the Complicated Domain (where experts can analyze and solve problems) or the Simple Domain (where best practices apply), the Complex Domain requires experimentation and adaptive approaches because cause-and-effect relationships only become apparent in retrospect. This is particularly relevant for technology professionals dealing with emergent systems, organizational change, or innovative product development.</p>
