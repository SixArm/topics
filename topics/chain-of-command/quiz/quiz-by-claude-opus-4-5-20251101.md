  <p>To establish hierarchy, authority, communication, and accountability for effective organizational function</p>
  <p>A chain of command defines an organization's hierarchy of authority, communication, and accountability. It establishes clear lines for decision-making, ensures employees know who they report to, defines levels of authority for management, and holds each person responsible for their tasks. This helps minimize confusion, streamline decision-making, and ensure everyone works together towards shared goals.</p>
