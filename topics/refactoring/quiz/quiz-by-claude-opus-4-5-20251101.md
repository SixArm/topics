  <p>To improve the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior</p>
  <p>Refactoring is the process of improving the design of existing code without changing its functionality. The goal is better code quality through improved readability, maintainability, and extensibility—not adding features, fixing bugs, or optimizing performance. These may be separate activities that benefit from well-refactored code, but refactoring itself preserves the existing behavior while restructuring the code to be easier to understand and modify.</p>
