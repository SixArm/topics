  <p>The franchisor licenses its brand, business model, and operating system in exchange for an initial fee and ongoing royalties</p>
  <p>The franchise business model is fundamentally a licensing arrangement where the franchisor grants the franchisee rights to use its established brand, proven business model, and operating systems. In return, the franchisee pays an initial franchise fee upfront and continues to pay ongoing royalties (typically a percentage of revenue). This creates a mutually beneficial relationship where the franchisor expands its brand reach while the franchisee gains access to a proven system with training and support.</p>
