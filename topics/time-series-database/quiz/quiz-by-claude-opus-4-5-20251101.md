  <p>Data that is constantly being appended with new data points</p>
  <p>Time-series databases are optimized for data that is constantly being appended with new data points, rather than modified or deleted. This reflects the nature of time-series data from sensors, IoT devices, and monitoring systems, where new measurements are continuously added over time while historical data typically remains unchanged.</p>
