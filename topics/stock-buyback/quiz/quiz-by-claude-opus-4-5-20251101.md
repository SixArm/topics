  <p>It increases earnings per share by reducing the number of outstanding shares</p>
  <p>When a company buys back its own shares, it reduces the total number of outstanding shares in the market. Since earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing total earnings by the number of outstanding shares, fewer shares means each remaining share represents a larger portion of the company's earnings. This can make the stock more attractive to investors and potentially increase the share price.</p>
