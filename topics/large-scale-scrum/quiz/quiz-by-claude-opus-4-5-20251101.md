  <p>Eliminating unnecessary organizational complexity rather than adding new process overhead</p>
  <p>LeSS operates on the principle of "more with less," emphasizing the elimination of unnecessary organizational complexity rather than adding new roles, artifacts, or ceremonies. The framework focuses on descaling organizational complexity to maintain agility while enabling coordinated delivery across larger product development initiatives. This distinguishes LeSS from other scaling frameworks that tend to add layers of process and roles.</p>
