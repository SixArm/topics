  <p>It allows organizations to access HR expertise and reduce overhead costs without managing an in-house HR department</p>
  <p>HRaaS enables organizations to outsource HR functions to third-party providers, which reduces overhead costs (salaries, benefits, office space) while providing access to a wider range of HR expertise and technology than they might afford in-house. This is especially valuable for smaller organizations that need professional HR capabilities without the expense of a full internal department.</p>
