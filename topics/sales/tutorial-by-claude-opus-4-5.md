### Stage 5: Proposal and Negotiation

- Present pricing, terms, and implementation plans
- Address objections and negotiate terms
- Navigate procurement and legal reviews

### Stage 6: Closing

- Finalize contracts and agreements
- Coordinate handoff to implementation and customer success teams
- Document lessons learned for future deals

## Sales Methodologies

Different methodologies suit different products, markets, and customer types. Technology companies often combine elements from multiple approaches.

| Methodology | Core Principle | Best For |
