  <p>Transitioning from controllers to facilitators who remove obstacles and provide guidance</p>
  <p>In the shift beyond command and control, leaders move away from micromanaging tasks and instead become facilitators who remove obstacles and provide guidance. This empowers teams to be self-organizing and accountable for outcomes, enabling faster delivery, higher quality software, and more engaged teams who can adapt effectively to changing requirements.</p>
