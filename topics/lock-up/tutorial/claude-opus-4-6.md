# Lock-up

A lock-up is a contractual restriction that prevents holders of stock options, shares, or other equity instruments from selling or exercising them for a specified period of time. Lock-up agreements are a fundamental mechanism in corporate finance, particularly during initial public offerings (IPOs), mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and equity compensation plans. For technology professionals, understanding lock-up provisions is essential because equity compensation is a core component of total remuneration in the tech industry, and lock-up terms directly affect when and how that compensation can be realized.

## How Lock-up Agreements Work

A lock-up agreement is a legally binding contract between a company (or its underwriters) and its shareholders or option holders. The agreement specifies a window of time during which the restricted party may not sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose of their equity holdings. The lock-up period typically begins at a triggering event, such as an IPO pricing date, the grant date of stock options, or the closing date of an acquisition. Once the lock-up period expires, the restricted shares or options become freely tradable, subject to applicable securities laws.

Lock-up agreements are not mandated by securities regulators like the SEC; rather, they are voluntary contractual provisions imposed by underwriters or negotiated between parties. However, they have become standard practice because they serve the interests of multiple stakeholders: the company, its investors, and the broader market.

## Common Lock-up Scenarios

Lock-up provisions appear in several contexts that technology professionals are likely to encounter during their careers.

- **IPO Lock-up**: When a company goes public, insiders including founders, executives, employees with equity grants, and pre-IPO investors are typically subject to a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days following the offering. This prevents a flood of shares entering the market immediately after the IPO.
- **Employee Equity Compensation**: Stock option plans often include lock-up provisions that work alongside vesting schedules. Even after options vest, a lock-up may prevent exercise or sale until a specified date or event.
- **M&A Lock-up**: In mergers and acquisitions, key shareholders or executives of the acquired company may agree to a lock-up period as a condition of the deal. This ensures continuity and signals confidence in the combined entity.
- **SPAC Lock-up**: In special purpose acquisition company transactions, sponsors and insiders typically face lock-up periods of 6 to 12 months after the business combination closes.
- **Secondary Offering Lock-up**: When a company conducts a follow-on offering, existing shareholders may agree to a temporary lock-up to avoid competing with the new issuance.

## Typical Lock-up Durations

| Scenario | Typical Duration | Parties Affected |
|---|---|---|
| IPO | 90–180 days | Founders, executives, employees, pre-IPO investors |
| Employee stock options | Varies with vesting schedule | Employees holding equity grants |
| M&A transaction | 6–24 months | Key shareholders, executives of acquired company |
| SPAC merger | 6–12 months | SPAC sponsors and insiders |
| Secondary offering | 30–90 days | Existing shareholders participating in offering |
| Venture capital investment | Until IPO or liquidity event | VC firms and institutional investors |

## Why Lock-ups Matter

Lock-up provisions serve several important purposes that affect both individual equity holders and the broader market.

- **Price stabilization**: By preventing a sudden surge of shares entering the market, lock-ups help maintain orderly trading and reduce volatility in the period following an IPO or other significant corporate event.
- **Investor confidence**: Institutional and retail investors are more willing to participate in an IPO when they know insiders cannot immediately dump their shares. The lock-up signals that insiders have a longer-term commitment to the company.
- **Alignment of incentives**: Lock-ups ensure that founders, executives, and key employees remain financially tied to the company's performance over a meaningful time horizon, reducing the temptation to cash out at the earliest opportunity.
- **Prevention of insider trading concerns**: By establishing a clear, predetermined restriction period, lock-ups reduce the risk of insiders being perceived as trading on material non-public information.

## Risks and Considerations for Equity Holders

Technology professionals holding equity subject to lock-up provisions should be aware of several risks.

- **Market risk during the lock-up**: The stock price may decline significantly during the lock-up period, and the holder cannot sell to limit losses. This is particularly relevant for employees who may have concentrated positions in a single company.
- **Lock-up expiration cliff**: When a lock-up expires, a large number of shares may become tradable simultaneously. This often creates downward pressure on the stock price around the expiration date, a phenomenon well-documented in IPO markets.
- **Tax implications**: The timing of option exercise relative to lock-up expiration can have significant tax consequences. Exercising incentive stock options (ISOs) triggers alternative minimum tax (AMT) considerations, and the inability to sell during a lock-up may create a tax liability without corresponding liquidity.
- **Limited liquidity**: During the lock-up period, the equity holder has no ability to convert shares to cash, which can create personal financial strain, especially if a large portion of net worth is tied up in company stock.
- **Early release provisions**: Some lock-up agreements include provisions for early release under certain conditions, such as if the stock price reaches a specified threshold or if the underwriter consents. Understanding these provisions is important for financial planning.

## Lock-up vs. Vesting

Lock-up periods and vesting schedules are related but distinct concepts that technology professionals frequently conflate.

| Characteristic | Lock-up | Vesting |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Restricts sale or exercise of already-owned equity | Determines when equity is earned or ownership transfers |
| Trigger | Typically tied to a corporate event (IPO, M&A) | Tied to time-based or milestone-based schedule |
| Duration | Usually a fixed period (90–180 days for IPOs) | Commonly 3–4 years with a 1-year cliff |
| Effect of violation | Contractual breach, potential legal liability | Unvested shares are forfeited |
| Applies to | Shares or options already vested and owned | Shares or options not yet earned |
| Negotiability | Often standardized by underwriters | May be negotiated in employment agreements |

In practice, an employee may have shares that are fully vested but still subject to a lock-up, meaning they own the shares but cannot sell them. Conversely, shares may be past the lock-up window but not yet vested, meaning they are tradable in principle but not yet owned.

## Strategies for Managing Lock-up Risk

- **Diversification planning**: Before the lock-up expires, develop a plan for gradually diversifying out of a concentrated stock position. Many financial advisors recommend establishing a 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows for predetermined sales at specified prices or dates.
- **Tax planning**: Consult a tax advisor well before the lock-up expiration to understand the implications of exercising options and selling shares. Timing decisions around ISO exercise, AMT exposure, and capital gains treatment require advance planning.
- **Hedging considerations**: In some cases, equity holders may be able to use financial instruments such as collars or prepaid forward contracts to manage downside risk, though lock-up agreements may restrict certain hedging strategies.
- **Understanding the agreement**: Read the lock-up agreement carefully. Pay attention to the exact expiration date, any early release provisions, transfer restrictions, and the consequences of breach.

## Summary

A lock-up is a contractual restriction that prevents equity holders from selling or exercising their shares or options for a defined period, most commonly following an IPO, M&A transaction, or as part of an equity compensation arrangement. Lock-ups serve to stabilize stock prices, align insider incentives with long-term company performance, and build investor confidence. For technology professionals, who frequently receive a significant portion of their compensation in equity, understanding lock-up terms is critical for financial planning, tax optimization, and risk management. The key takeaway is that owning equity and being able to liquidate it are two different things, and the lock-up period defines the gap between the two.
