## Lock-Up: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

Lock-up provisions are critical contractual mechanisms that restrict when shareholders can sell their equity. For technology professionals—especially those receiving stock options, RSUs, or other equity compensation—understanding lock-ups is essential for financial planning and navigating company liquidity events.

## What Is a Lock-Up?

A lock-up is a legally binding restriction that prevents shareholders from selling, transferring, or exercising their equity holdings for a specified period. The restriction applies to company insiders, employees, early investors, and other stakeholders who hold significant equity positions.

Lock-ups serve as market stabilization tools during major corporate events. They prevent large volumes of shares from flooding the market simultaneously, which would depress stock prices and harm all shareholders.

## When Lock-Ups Apply

Lock-ups are triggered by specific corporate events:

| Event Type | Typical Lock-Up Duration | Who Is Affected |
|------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Initial Public Offering (IPO) | 90–180 days | Insiders, employees, early investors |
| Direct Listing | 90–180 days | Same as IPO, though terms vary |
| SPAC Merger | 6–12 months | Founders, sponsors, PIPE investors |
| Merger & Acquisition (M&A) | Varies by deal | Selling company shareholders |
| Secondary Offering | 30–90 days | Participating shareholders |

## How Lock-Ups Work in an IPO

The IPO lock-up is the most common scenario technology professionals encounter. Here is the typical sequence:

- **Pre-IPO**: Employees hold stock options or RSUs that may have vested but cannot be sold publicly
- **IPO Date**: Company shares begin trading on a public exchange
- **Lock-Up Period**: Insiders cannot sell shares, typically for 180 days post-IPO
- **Lock-Up Expiration**: Insiders become free to sell, often causing temporary price volatility

Investment banks underwriting the IPO negotiate lock-up terms. The underwriters want to prevent a sudden supply increase that would undermine the offering price they set.

## Who Is Subject to Lock-Up Restrictions

| Stakeholder Category | Typically Subject to Lock-Up | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Founders & Executives | Yes | Often longest restrictions |
| Board Members | Yes | May have additional trading windows |
| Employees with Equity | Yes | Covers vested options and RSUs |
| Venture Capital Investors | Yes | May negotiate shorter terms |
| Angel Investors | Yes | Terms vary by investment agreement |
| Public Market Buyers | No | Purchase shares after IPO freely |

## Types of Lock-Up Provisions

**Hard Lock-Up**
A complete prohibition on selling any shares during the lock-up period. No exceptions are granted regardless of circumstances.

**Soft Lock-Up**
Permits limited sales under specific conditions, such as:
- Sales below a certain percentage of holdings
- Pre-arranged 10b5-1 trading plans
- Sales approved by the underwriters

**Staggered Lock-Up**
Releases shares in tranches over time rather than all at once. For example:
- 25% released at 90 days
- 50% released at 120 days
- 100% released at 180 days

**Early Release Provisions**
Some lock-ups include triggers for early termination:
- Stock price exceeds a threshold for a sustained period
- A specified time passes after quarterly earnings
- Underwriters waive the restriction

## Why Lock-Ups Matter for Technology Professionals

**Financial Planning**
You cannot count on equity liquidity until the lock-up expires. Plan your finances assuming restricted shares are illiquid assets.

**Tax Implications**
Lock-up expiration does not change tax treatment, but it affects when you can sell to cover tax obligations. If you exercise ISOs or receive RSU vests, you may owe taxes before you can sell shares.

**Price Volatility**
Lock-up expiration dates often correlate with stock price drops as supply increases. The market anticipates this, so sophisticated investors may short the stock approaching expiration.

**Coordination with Trading Windows**
Public company employees face both lock-up restrictions and ongoing insider trading policies. Even after lock-up expiration, you may only sell during designated trading windows.

## Lock-Up Expiration: What to Expect

The days surrounding lock-up expiration create predictable market dynamics:

| Phase | Timing | Market Behavior |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Anticipation | 2–4 weeks before | Increased volatility, potential price decline |
| Expiration Day | Day of release | High trading volume, price pressure |
| Settlement | 1–2 weeks after | Price stabilization as selling pressure subsides |

Not all insiders sell immediately. Many retain shares due to confidence in the company, tax optimization strategies, or contractual obligations. The actual selling pressure is typically less severe than the theoretical maximum.

## Strategies for Managing Lock-Up Periods

**Before the Lock-Up Begins**
- Understand your equity agreement terms thoroughly
- Confirm the exact lock-up duration and any early release conditions
- Consult a tax advisor about exercise timing for options

**During the Lock-Up**
- Do not assume you can sell at expiration—verify with your company's legal team
- Monitor company announcements that might extend restrictions
- Build an emergency fund that does not depend on equity liquidity

**At Lock-Up Expiration**
- Confirm your shares are released and tradeable
- Check for blackout periods or trading window restrictions
- Consider a 10b5-1 plan for systematic selling
- Evaluate tax-loss harvesting opportunities if prices decline

## Common Misconceptions

**"Lock-up expiration means I must sell"**
False. You have no obligation to sell. Many employees hold shares long-term.

**"The lock-up period is the same for everyone"**
False. Executives, board members, and large shareholders often have different terms than rank-and-file employees.

**"Lock-ups only apply to IPOs"**
False. M&A transactions, secondary offerings, and other liquidity events frequently include lock-up provisions.

**"I can transfer shares to family members during lock-up"**
Usually false. Most lock-ups prohibit transfers, not just sales. The transferred shares typically remain restricted.

## Regulatory and Legal Context

Lock-ups are contractual agreements, not SEC requirements. However, they interact with securities regulations:

- **Rule 144**: Governs resale of restricted and control securities, imposing holding periods separate from contractual lock-ups
- **Section 16**: Requires officers and directors to report transactions and restricts short-swing profits
- **10b5-1 Plans**: Pre-established trading plans that can be set up during lock-up for execution after expiration

Violating a lock-up agreement can result in:
- Breach of contract claims
- Rescission of the transaction
- Disgorgement of profits
- Damaged relationships with underwriters affecting future offerings

## Key Takeaways

- Lock-ups restrict equity sales for a defined period following major corporate events
- Standard IPO lock-ups last 180 days but terms vary significantly
- Lock-up expiration often creates short-term price volatility
- Plan finances conservatively—treat locked shares as illiquid until restrictions lift
- Coordinate lock-up timing with tax planning, trading windows, and personal financial goals
- Consult legal and tax professionals before making decisions about restricted equity

Understanding lock-up provisions enables technology professionals to make informed decisions about equity compensation, negotiate better terms when possible, and avoid costly mistakes during liquidity events.
