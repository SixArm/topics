  <p>To prevent insiders from exercising options and selling shares immediately, which could destabilize the stock price</p>
  <p>Lock-ups protect the company and its shareholders by preventing insider trading that could flood the market with shares and depress the stock price. This is especially important during events like an IPO, where a sudden influx of shares from insiders could significantly impact market stability.</p>
