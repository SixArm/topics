  <p>To allow majority shareholders to force minority shareholders to join in the sale of a company</p>
  <p>Drag-along rights enable majority shareholders to "drag along" minority shareholders when selling a company to a third party. This provision prevents a small minority from blocking a sale that the majority has agreed to, which is particularly important for venture capitalists who need a clear exit path for their investments.</p>
