  <p>Product-based planning focused on defining and delivering project deliverables</p>
  <p>PRINCE2 employs a product-based planning approach, which focuses on defining and delivering project deliverables or products. This distinguishes PRINCE2 from methodologies that center primarily on activities or tasks. By focusing on products (outputs and deliverables), teams gain clarity on what needs to be produced, quality criteria for acceptance, and dependencies between deliverables—making project scope more tangible and measurable.</p>
