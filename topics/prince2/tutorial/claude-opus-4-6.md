# PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments)

PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments) is a structured, process-driven project management methodology originally developed by the UK government and now maintained by AXELOS. It is one of the most widely adopted project management frameworks in the world, particularly across Europe, Australia, and government sectors globally. PRINCE2 provides a common vocabulary, a defined set of processes, and clear governance structures that enable organizations to deliver projects consistently, regardless of size, sector, or complexity. For technology professionals, PRINCE2 offers a disciplined framework that complements agile practices and provides executive-level controls over scope, risk, and business justification throughout the project lifecycle.

## History and Evolution

PRINCE was first established in 1989 by the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), a UK government body, as a standard for managing IT projects. It was based on an earlier method called PROMPTII (Project Resource Organisation Management Planning Techniques). In 1996, the methodology was significantly revised and relaunched as PRINCE2, broadening its applicability beyond IT to all types of projects. AXELOS, a joint venture between the UK Cabinet Office and Capita, took over ownership in 2013. The most recent major update, PRINCE2 2017 (also known as the 6th edition), streamlined the guidance and better aligned the methodology with contemporary practices including agile delivery. PRINCE2 Agile, released in 2015, provides specific guidance on blending PRINCE2 governance with agile ways of working.

## The Seven Principles

PRINCE2 is built upon seven principles that serve as guiding obligations. A project that does not adhere to these principles is not considered a PRINCE2 project.

- **Continued Business Justification**: Every project must have a documented and approved business case that is regularly reviewed to confirm the project remains viable, desirable, and achievable. If the business case is no longer valid, the project should be closed.
- **Learn from Experience**: Project teams must actively seek and apply lessons from previous projects during initiation, execution, and closure. A lessons log is maintained throughout the project.
- **Defined Roles and Responsibilities**: A clear organizational structure is established with defined roles so that every participant knows what is expected of them and who is accountable for each aspect of the project.
- **Manage by Stages**: The project is planned, monitored, and controlled on a stage-by-stage basis, providing senior management with control points at stage boundaries where progress is assessed and decisions are made.
- **Manage by Exception**: Tolerances are set for each project objective (time, cost, quality, scope, risk, benefit), and authority is delegated accordingly. Issues are only escalated when tolerances are forecast to be exceeded.
- **Focus on Products**: The project concentrates on the definition, delivery, and quality of the products (deliverables) rather than simply on activities. Product descriptions drive planning and quality expectations.
- **Tailor to Suit the Project Environment**: PRINCE2 must be adapted to the specific context, size, complexity, importance, and risk of the project. Applying the method without tailoring leads to excessive bureaucracy or insufficient control.

## The Seven Themes

Themes describe aspects of project management that must be addressed continuously throughout the project. They provide guidance on how to apply the principles in practice.

| Theme | Purpose | Key Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| Business Case | Establishes and maintains the justification for the project | Business Case document |
| Organization | Defines the project management team structure and accountabilities | Project organization structure |
| Quality | Defines quality expectations, methods, and responsibilities | Quality Management Strategy |
| Plans | Defines the steps required to develop plans and the techniques to use | Project Plan, Stage Plans, Team Plans |
| Risk | Identifies, assesses, and controls uncertainty | Risk Management Strategy, Risk Register |
| Change | Assesses and controls the impact of changes to baselines | Configuration Management Strategy, Issue Register |
| Progress | Monitors and compares actual achievements against plan, provides forecasts | Highlight Reports, End Stage Reports |

## The Seven Processes

PRINCE2 defines seven processes that cover the chronological flow of the project from pre-project through to closure.

- **Starting Up a Project (SU)**: A pre-project process that ensures the prerequisites for initiating the project are in place. The project brief, outline business case, and project approach are produced. The project board and project manager are appointed.
- **Directing a Project (DP)**: Runs from initiation through to closure and provides the project board with the mechanism for decision-making, authorization, and overall control. The board authorizes initiation, each stage, and project closure.
- **Initiating a Project (IP)**: Establishes solid foundations for the project by creating the Project Initiation Documentation (PID), which includes the detailed business case, project plan, strategies for risk, quality, communication, and configuration management.
- **Controlling a Stage (CS)**: Describes how the project manager manages the day-to-day work within a stage, including authorizing work packages, monitoring progress, handling issues, and reporting to the project board.
- **Managing Product Delivery (MP)**: Provides the interface between the project manager and the team managers, ensuring that planned products are created and delivered to the agreed quality standards.
- **Managing a Stage Boundary (SB)**: Provides the project board with the information needed to review the current stage, approve the next stage plan, and confirm continued business justification.
- **Closing a Project (CP)**: Covers the controlled close of the project, including handover of products, evaluation of the project against its baseline, capturing lessons, and planning post-project benefits reviews.

## Roles and Responsibilities

PRINCE2 defines a project management team structure with four levels of authority. Each role carries specific responsibilities and decision-making powers.

| Role | Level | Key Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| Corporate/Programme Management | Strategic | Commissions the project, sets constraints, provides resources |
| Project Board | Direction | Authorizes stages, makes key decisions, provides guidance, accountable for success |
| Executive | Direction | Owns the business case, chairs the project board, ultimate decision-maker |
| Senior User | Direction | Represents user interests, specifies needs, confirms acceptability of products |
| Senior Supplier | Direction | Represents supplier interests, provides resources, ensures technical feasibility |
| Project Manager | Management | Day-to-day management, planning, monitoring, reporting, managing risks and issues |
| Team Manager | Delivery | Manages team execution of work packages, reports progress to project manager |
| Project Assurance | Assurance | Independent oversight on behalf of the board (business, user, supplier assurance) |
| Project Support | Support | Administrative support, configuration management, tools and techniques |
| Change Authority | Control | Delegated authority from the board to approve changes within set limits |

## Management Products

PRINCE2 defines a set of management products (documents and records) that support project governance. These are categorized into three groups.

- **Baselines**: Documents that define agreed targets and plans. These include the Project Initiation Documentation (PID), Project Plan, Stage Plans, Work Packages, and Product Descriptions.
- **Records**: Dynamic documents that maintain information about project status. These include the Daily Log, Lessons Log, Issue Register, Risk Register, and Quality Register.
- **Reports**: Snapshots of status at particular points. These include Highlight Reports, Checkpoint Reports, End Stage Reports, End Project Reports, Exception Reports, and Lessons Reports.

Technology teams should note that PRINCE2 does not prescribe templates rigidly. Management products should be tailored to the project context, and in smaller projects, several products may be combined or simplified.

## PRINCE2 Compared to Other Methodologies

| Aspect | PRINCE2 | PMP/PMBOK | Agile (Scrum) | ITIL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Focus | Project governance and control | Knowledge areas and process groups | Iterative delivery and team empowerment | IT service management |
| Structure | Prescriptive processes and roles | Descriptive best practices | Lightweight framework | Service lifecycle processes |
| Certification Body | AXELOS | PMI | Scrum Alliance, Scrum.org | AXELOS |
| Business Case | Central, continuously validated | Recommended, not mandated | Implicitly through product backlog value | Not project-focused |
| Flexibility | Tailorable to project size | Scalable through selection of practices | Highly adaptive by design | Focused on operational services |
| Stages/Iterations | Sequential management stages | Phase-based | Time-boxed sprints | Not applicable |
| Best Suited For | Controlled, governance-heavy environments | Broad project types | Fast-changing requirements, software delivery | Ongoing IT operations |

## PRINCE2 Agile

PRINCE2 Agile combines the governance framework of PRINCE2 with agile delivery approaches such as Scrum, Kanban, and Lean Startup. It was introduced to address the common challenge technology organizations face: the need for both organizational governance and team-level agility.

- PRINCE2 provides the project direction, authorization, and business justification layer.
- Agile methods handle the delivery layer, with iterative development, frequent feedback, and adaptive planning.
- PRINCE2 Agile introduces the Agilometer, a tool for assessing how much agile practice is appropriate for a given project environment based on factors such as flexibility on requirements, ease of communication, and organizational acceptance of agile.
- Management stages in PRINCE2 Agile are typically aligned with releases, and work packages correspond to sprints or iterations.
- Tolerances are used as the primary mechanism for integrating the two approaches: teams are given flexibility within defined tolerances, and exceptions are escalated through the PRINCE2 governance structure.

## Tailoring PRINCE2 for Technology Projects

Technology professionals should consider several factors when applying PRINCE2 to software and IT projects.

- **Scale the documentation**: For small projects or internal tools, management products can be lightweight. A single-page business case or a shared wiki page may suffice.
- **Align stages with delivery milestones**: Map management stages to meaningful technical milestones such as architecture sign-off, integration testing completion, or production readiness.
- **Integrate with DevOps practices**: PRINCE2 governance can coexist with CI/CD pipelines. Use automated reporting and dashboards to satisfy progress reporting requirements without manual overhead.
- **Leverage existing tools**: Issue registers, risk logs, and quality registers can be maintained in tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, or GitLab rather than separate documents.
- **Define product descriptions for technical deliverables**: Use product descriptions to specify acceptance criteria for APIs, data migrations, infrastructure provisioning, and other technical outputs.
- **Combine with agile at the delivery level**: Use PRINCE2 for project-level governance while empowering delivery teams to use Scrum, Kanban, or other agile methods within work packages.

## Certification Paths

PRINCE2 offers a tiered certification structure for practitioners.

| Certification | Target Audience | Prerequisite | Focus |

## Summary

PRINCE2 is a principle-driven, process-based project management methodology that provides technology professionals with a rigorous governance framework for delivering projects in a controlled manner. Its seven principles, seven themes, and seven processes create a comprehensive structure that addresses business justification, quality, risk, change, and progress throughout the project lifecycle. The methodology's emphasis on tailoring makes it applicable to projects of all sizes, and PRINCE2 Agile extends its relevance into modern software delivery environments. For technology teams operating in organizations that require formal governance, auditability, and clear lines of authority, PRINCE2 provides a proven and internationally recognized approach that complements agile delivery practices rather than replacing them.
