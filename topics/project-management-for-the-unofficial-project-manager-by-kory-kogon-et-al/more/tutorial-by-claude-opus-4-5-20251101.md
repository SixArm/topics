## Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager by Kory Kogon et al.

"Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager: A FranklinCovey Title" by Kory Kogon, Suzette Blakemore, and James Wood addresses a common reality in modern workplaces: many professionals manage projects without formal training, certification, or the official title of project manager. This book bridges that gap by providing practical, accessible guidance for anyone who finds themselves responsible for delivering results through coordinated effort.

## The Unofficial Project Manager Phenomenon

In technology organizations, the unofficial project manager is ubiquitous. Developers lead feature implementations. Designers coordinate cross-functional design systems. Engineers own infrastructure migrations. These individuals carry project responsibility without the PMP certification or dedicated role.

The book recognizes this reality and builds its framework around it. Rather than overwhelming readers with heavyweight methodologies, it distills project management into actionable principles that anyone can apply immediately.

## The People-First Approach

A distinguishing characteristic of this book is its emphasis on the human side of project management. The authors argue that project success depends as much on relationships and influence as it does on schedules and budgets.

| Traditional Focus | People-First Focus |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Gantt charts and timelines | Building trust with stakeholders |
| Resource allocation | Developing team members |
| Risk registers | Navigating organizational politics |
| Status reports | Communicating with impact |
| Scope documents | Gaining buy-in and alignment |

This approach resonates particularly well with technology professionals, who often work in matrix organizations where authority is distributed and influence must be earned rather than assumed.

## The Four Foundational Behaviors

The book introduces four foundational behaviors that unofficial project managers must develop:

**Demonstrate Respect**: Treat every team member and stakeholder as capable individuals with valuable contributions. This creates psychological safety and encourages open communication about risks and problems.

**Listen First**: Before proposing solutions or making decisions, understand the perspectives, concerns, and constraints of those involved. This prevents costly misunderstandings and builds alignment.

**Clarify Expectations**: Ambiguity kills projects. Be explicit about deliverables, timelines, quality standards, and individual responsibilities. Document agreements and revisit them regularly.

**Practice Accountability**: Hold yourself and others responsible for commitments. Address missed deadlines and quality issues directly but constructively. Model the accountability you expect from others.

## The Five Project Management Process Groups

The book aligns with standard project management frameworks by organizing work into five process groups:

### Initiation

Define what the project will accomplish and why it matters. Establish the business case, identify key stakeholders, and secure initial authorization to proceed. For technology projects, this includes:

- Articulating the problem being solved
- Identifying success criteria and metrics
- Determining who has decision-making authority
- Understanding constraints and dependencies
- Documenting assumptions

### Planning

Create the roadmap for execution. The authors emphasize that planning is iterative—initial plans will change as you learn more. Key planning activities include:

- Breaking work into manageable tasks
- Estimating effort and duration
- Identifying dependencies and sequencing work
- Assigning responsibilities
- Anticipating risks and preparing responses
- Establishing communication cadences

### Execution

Do the work. This is where the people-first approach becomes critical. Execution involves:

- Coordinating team activities
- Removing obstacles and blockers
- Making decisions within your authority
- Escalating issues appropriately
- Maintaining momentum and morale

### Monitoring and Controlling

Track progress against the plan and make adjustments. This includes:

- Measuring actual versus planned progress
- Identifying variances early
- Implementing corrective actions
- Managing scope changes through a defined process
- Keeping stakeholders informed

### Closure

Formally complete the project. Many unofficial project managers neglect this phase, but it matters:

- Confirming all deliverables are accepted
- Documenting lessons learned
- Celebrating team accomplishments
- Releasing resources
- Archiving project materials

## Managing the Triple Constraint

The book addresses the classic project management challenge of balancing scope, time, and cost. For unofficial project managers, this often manifests as:

| Constraint | Technology Context |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Scope | Feature requirements, technical specifications, quality standards |
| Time | Release deadlines, sprint commitments, market windows |
| Cost | Headcount, infrastructure expenses, tool licenses |

The key insight is that these constraints are interconnected. Expanding scope without adjusting time or cost is a recipe for failure. Unofficial project managers must develop the confidence to have honest conversations about tradeoffs with stakeholders.

## Stakeholder Management

The authors dedicate significant attention to stakeholder management, recognizing that unofficial project managers often lack positional authority. Effective stakeholder management requires:

**Identification**: Map all individuals and groups affected by or able to affect the project. In technology contexts, this includes product owners, engineering leaders, operations teams, security reviewers, legal and compliance, and end users.

**Analysis**: Understand each stakeholder's interests, influence, and potential concerns. What do they need from this project? What might cause them to resist or delay?

**Engagement**: Develop tailored approaches for each stakeholder group. Some need detailed technical updates. Others want executive summaries. Some require early involvement in decisions. Others prefer to review and approve.

**Communication**: Establish regular touchpoints and adapt your communication style to your audience. Avoid jargon when speaking with non-technical stakeholders. Be concise with executives. Be thorough with implementers.

## Risk Management for Practitioners

The book presents risk management in accessible terms. Rather than elaborate risk matrices and quantitative analysis, it focuses on practical identification and response:

- Brainstorm what could go wrong with your team
- Assess likelihood and impact using simple high/medium/low categories
- Develop response strategies: avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept
- Monitor risks throughout the project and update assessments
- Communicate significant risks to stakeholders proactively

For technology projects, common risk categories include:

- Technical complexity and uncertainty
- Dependencies on external systems or teams
- Resource availability and skill gaps
- Requirement volatility
- Integration and deployment challenges

## Team Dynamics and Collaboration

The book acknowledges that unofficial project managers rarely have direct authority over team members. Building effective collaboration requires:

**Clarity of Purpose**: Ensure everyone understands why the project matters and how their contributions fit into the whole.

**Role Definition**: Make responsibilities explicit. Use techniques like RACI matrices (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) to eliminate ambiguity.

**Conflict Resolution**: Address disagreements constructively. Focus on interests rather than positions. Seek solutions that meet underlying needs.

**Recognition**: Acknowledge contributions and celebrate progress. People invest discretionary effort in projects where they feel valued.

## Practical Tools and Templates

The authors provide templates and tools throughout the book:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Project Charter | Document project purpose, scope, and authority |
| Stakeholder Register | Track stakeholders and engagement strategies |
| Work Breakdown Structure | Decompose work into manageable pieces |
| RACI Matrix | Clarify roles and responsibilities |
| Risk Register | Track identified risks and responses |
| Status Report Template | Communicate progress consistently |
| Lessons Learned Template | Capture insights for future projects |

These tools are deliberately simple. The goal is usability, not comprehensiveness. Unofficial project managers need lightweight approaches that add value without creating administrative burden.

## Applying the Framework in Technology Organizations

Technology professionals can adapt the book's principles to common scenarios:

**Feature Development**: Use the five process groups to structure work from initial requirements through deployment. Emphasize stakeholder alignment during initiation and risk management during planning.

**System Migrations**: Apply rigorous planning and monitoring given the complexity and risk. Use the people-first behaviors to navigate resistance to change.

**Cross-Team Initiatives**: Lean heavily on stakeholder management and communication. Build coalitions and influence without authority.

**Incident Response**: Even rapid response benefits from clear role definition and accountability. Post-incident reviews align with the closure and lessons learned practices.

## Comparison with Formal Methodologies

| Aspect | Formal PM (PMP/PRINCE2) | Unofficial PM Approach |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Certification required | Yes | No |
| Documentation intensity | High | Moderate |
| Process rigor | Prescriptive | Adaptive |
| Organizational support | Dedicated PMO | Self-directed |
| Tool complexity | Enterprise software | Lightweight tools |
| Learning curve | Steep | Gradual |

The book does not replace formal methodologies but provides a practical foundation. Professionals who later pursue PMP or other certifications will find the transition easier having internalized these fundamentals.

## Key Takeaways for Technology Professionals
