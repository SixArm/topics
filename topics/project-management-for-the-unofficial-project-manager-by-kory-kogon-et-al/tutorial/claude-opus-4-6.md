# Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager by Kory Kogon et al.

"Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager: A FranklinCovey Title" by Kory Kogon, Suzette Blakemore, and James Wood addresses a reality that most technology professionals know well: project management responsibilities frequently land on people who have no formal training in the discipline. Software engineers, team leads, designers, and analysts are regularly asked to coordinate cross-functional efforts, hit deadlines, and deliver results without ever holding the title of "project manager." This book provides a structured yet accessible framework for succeeding in that role, drawing on FranklinCovey's research into leadership, productivity, and execution.

## The Unofficial Project Manager

The premise of the book is that modern organizations increasingly rely on knowledge workers to manage projects as part of their broader responsibilities. Traditional project management certifications, heavyweight methodologies, and enterprise tooling are often overkill for these scenarios. What unofficial project managers need instead is a practical playbook that combines people skills with process discipline. Kogon, Blakemore, and Wood argue that success depends equally on how you lead people and how you manage work, and the book is organized around both dimensions.

## The People Side: Foundational Behaviors

Before introducing any process framework, the authors establish four foundational behaviors that underpin effective project leadership. These behaviors reflect FranklinCovey's broader philosophy that trust and relationships are prerequisites for execution.

| Behavior | Description |
|---|---|
| Demonstrate respect | Treat every team member and stakeholder as a valued contributor, regardless of title or seniority. |
| Listen first | Seek to understand concerns, constraints, and motivations before proposing solutions or assigning work. |
| Clarify expectations | Remove ambiguity by ensuring that everyone shares the same understanding of scope, roles, and success criteria. |
| Practice accountability | Own outcomes personally and create an environment where the team does the same without blame or defensiveness. |

These behaviors are not soft platitudes. In technology settings, where teams are often distributed, cross-functional, and staffed with specialists who have competing priorities, the ability to build trust quickly is a genuine competitive advantage. A developer who can run a project kickoff that establishes psychological safety will consistently outperform one who jumps straight into Gantt charts.

## The Process Side: Five Core Processes

The structural backbone of the book is a five-phase project lifecycle that maps closely to conventional project management but is deliberately simplified for practitioners who are not full-time project managers.

- **Initiate**: Define the project purpose, identify stakeholders, and establish a clear scope statement. The authors emphasize that many projects fail not because of poor execution but because of poor initiation, where the team builds the wrong thing or lacks sponsorship.

- **Plan**: Break the work down into deliverables and tasks, estimate effort and duration, assign resources, and identify risks. The book provides lightweight planning templates that are practical for a two-person feature team or a ten-person cross-departmental initiative alike.

- **Execute**: Carry out the plan while managing team dynamics, communication cadences, and stakeholder expectations. This is where the foundational behaviors are most visible, as execution depends on the unofficial project manager's ability to influence without authority.

- **Monitor and Control**: Track progress against the plan, identify variances early, and make corrective adjustments. The authors advocate for regular status checkpoints and transparent reporting rather than elaborate earned-value calculations.

- **Close**: Formally complete the project, capture lessons learned, celebrate successes, and release resources. Closure is the phase most frequently skipped by unofficial project managers, and the book makes a strong case for its importance in building institutional knowledge and team morale.

## Managing Constraints

Technology projects are defined by constraints, and the authors dedicate significant attention to how unofficial project managers should think about and negotiate them. The classic triple constraint of scope, time, and cost is presented alongside a fourth dimension that is especially relevant in technology work: quality.

| Constraint | Key Question | Common Technology Pitfall |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | What exactly must be delivered? | Scope creep from vague requirements or stakeholder wish lists. |
| Time | When must it be delivered? | Unrealistic deadlines set without consulting the team. |
| Cost | What budget and resources are available? | Headcount treated as infinitely flexible when it is not. |
| Quality | What level of quality is acceptable? | Cutting testing or documentation to meet arbitrary dates. |

The authors stress that these constraints are interdependent. Changing one always affects the others. The unofficial project manager's job is to make these trade-offs visible to stakeholders rather than absorbing them silently, which is a common failure mode for technical contributors who default to "just working harder."

## Stakeholder Management and Communication

A recurring theme is that unofficial project managers often lack formal authority over the people they need to coordinate. The book provides concrete strategies for this challenge.

- **Stakeholder mapping**: Identify who has influence, who has interest, and who has both. Prioritize communication and relationship-building accordingly.

- **Communication planning**: Define what information each stakeholder group needs, how often they need it, and in what format. Over-communication is almost always preferable to under-communication for unofficial project managers who lack positional power.

- **Influence without authority**: Use the foundational behaviors, especially listening first and clarifying expectations, to build credibility. When you cannot direct people, you must persuade them, and persuasion requires trust.

- **Managing up**: Keep sponsors and executives informed proactively. Surface risks and trade-offs early rather than waiting until they become crises. Decision-makers respect project leads who bring them options, not just problems.

## Collaboration and Team Dynamics

The book draws on FranklinCovey's research to address how unofficial project managers can foster effective teamwork even when team members do not report to them.

Key recommendations include establishing clear roles and responsibilities at the outset using a simple responsibility matrix, running efficient meetings with defined agendas and documented action items, addressing conflict directly and early rather than allowing it to fester, and recognizing contributions visibly to reinforce engagement. For technology professionals, these practices are especially important in cross-functional settings where a project team might include engineers, designers, QA specialists, product managers, and business analysts who each bring different working styles and priorities.

## Tools and Templates

Rather than prescribing specific software, the authors provide generic tools and templates that can be adapted to any environment, from a spreadsheet to a dedicated project management platform.

- **Project scope statement**: A one-page document that captures purpose, deliverables, constraints, assumptions, and success criteria.
- **Work breakdown structure**: A hierarchical decomposition of deliverables into manageable tasks.
- **Risk register**: A simple table for identifying risks, assessing their likelihood and impact, and assigning mitigation owners.
- **Status report template**: A standardized format for communicating progress, issues, and upcoming milestones to stakeholders.
- **Lessons learned template**: A structured format for capturing what went well, what did not, and what the team would do differently.

These tools are deliberately lightweight. The book's philosophy is that a one-page scope statement that actually gets read and referenced is far more valuable than a fifty-page project plan that sits in a shared drive untouched.

## Applicability in Agile and Technology Environments

While the book does not explicitly position itself within Agile or any specific software development methodology, its principles are highly compatible with iterative approaches. The emphasis on short feedback loops, stakeholder alignment, and adaptive planning maps naturally onto Scrum, Kanban, and other frameworks that technology teams commonly use. The foundational behaviors of respect, listening, clarity, and accountability are methodology-agnostic and are equally relevant whether a team is running two-week sprints or executing a waterfall delivery.

Where the book is most valuable for technology professionals is in bridging the gap between technical execution and organizational leadership. Many engineers and technical leads are comfortable with the mechanics of building software but less practiced at the communication, negotiation, and relationship-building that determine whether a project succeeds in the broader organizational context.

## Summary

"Project Management for the Unofficial Project Manager" fills an important gap for technology professionals who manage projects without formal training or authority. Its central insight, that project success depends equally on people skills and process discipline, is both simple and powerful. The four foundational behaviors provide a leadership framework that builds trust and credibility, while the five core processes offer a practical lifecycle that scales from small technical initiatives to larger cross-functional programs. For engineers, technical leads, and other technology professionals who find themselves coordinating work across teams and stakeholders, this book provides a pragmatic and immediately actionable guide to delivering results without a project management title.
