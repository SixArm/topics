  <p>The temporal behavior and duration of signals or events</p>
  <p>A timing diagram is a graphical representation that shows the timing and duration of signals or events in a digital system. The horizontal axis represents time, while the vertical axis represents signal values. This visualization is essential for analyzing clock speeds, signal propagation delays, and system latencies in electronics and digital communication systems.</p>
