  <p>Number of customers lost divided by total customers at the beginning of the period</p>
  <p>Churn rate is calculated by dividing the number of customers who cancel or don't renew during a period by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period, then expressing the result as a percentage. For example, if a company starts with 1,000 customers and loses 50, the churn rate is 5% (50/1,000). This metric is essential for measuring customer retention and identifying potential issues with product satisfaction or customer service.</p>
