# Agile in government sector

The government sector has increasingly adopted agile methodologies to deliver digital services more efficiently and responsively to citizens. The U.S. Digital Service (USDS) exemplifies this transformation, having successfully rescued the failing Healthcare.gov website in 2013 using agile practices. The team implemented iterative development cycles, continuous user feedback, and cross-functional collaboration to rebuild the platform within months rather than years.

The UK's Government Digital Service (GDS) has become a global leader in agile government technology. Their GOV.UK platform consolidated thousands of government websites into a single, user-centered portal using agile principles. The team employed short sprints, regular user testing, and continuous deployment to create a service that processes millions of transactions annually while maintaining high user satisfaction rates.

In Australia, the Digital Transformation Agency adopted agile methods to modernize legacy systems across federal departments. Their myGov platform demonstrates how agile practices can integrate multiple government services into a cohesive digital experience. The project used scrum methodology, with regular stakeholder reviews and iterative improvements based on citizen feedback.

The City of Boston's Street Bump mobile app represents successful agile implementation at the municipal level. The development team used rapid prototyping and citizen feedback loops to create an application that automatically reports road conditions to city maintenance crews. This agile approach enabled quick adaptation to user needs and technical constraints.

These examples demonstrate that agile methodologies can overcome traditional government challenges of lengthy procurement cycles, rigid requirements, and risk-averse cultures. Success factors include executive support, dedicated cross-functional teams, and a willingness to embrace iterative improvement over perfect initial solutions. The results show improved citizen satisfaction, reduced development costs, and faster delivery of essential digital services.
