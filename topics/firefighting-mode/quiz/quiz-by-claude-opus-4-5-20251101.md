  <p>There may be deeper issues such as unclear priorities, insufficient resources, or a reactive culture</p>
  <p>While firefighting mode can be necessary at times, persistent firefighting is often a symptom of underlying organizational or management problems. These may include lack of clear priorities, poor communication, resources spread too thin, or a culture focused on reacting to crises rather than preventing them. Healthy organizations work to identify root causes and implement proactive problem-solving to avoid constantly operating in reactive mode.</p>
