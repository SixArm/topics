  <p>Confusion, delays, and a lack of clarity</p>
  <p>Inadequate planning—insufficiently defining project scope, objectives, deliverables, timelines, and resource requirements—leads directly to confusion among team members, delays in execution, and a lack of clarity about what needs to be accomplished. This is one of the most fundamental causes of project failure because all other project activities depend on having a solid plan as their foundation.</p>
