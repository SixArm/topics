# What is agile?

Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress over rigid planning and documentation. It prioritizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a fixed plan.

The core principle of agile revolves around collaboration with customers and stakeholders, enabling teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements.

Agile's emphasis on face-to-face communication, self-organizing teams, and sustainable development pace fosters higher team morale and productivity. The methodology reduces risk by delivering value early and often, allowing for course corrections before significant resources are invested in the wrong direction.

The benefits of agile include faster time-to-market, improved product quality through continuous testing and integration, enhanced customer satisfaction through regular feedback incorporation, and increased team adaptability to change. However, agile requires strong collaboration skills, customer involvement, and cultural shift from traditional project management approaches to be successful.
