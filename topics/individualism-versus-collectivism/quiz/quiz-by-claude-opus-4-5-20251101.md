  <p>Individualistic cultures prioritize personal goals and autonomy, while collectivist cultures emphasize group harmony and interdependence</p>
  <p>According to Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework, individualistic cultures (such as the US and Western Europe) value independence, personal achievements, and individual rights, with people making their own decisions and pursuing personal success. Collectivist cultures (such as China, Japan, and many Latin American countries) place emphasis on group harmony, the well-being of the community, cooperation, loyalty, and maintaining harmonious relationships. Understanding this dimension is crucial for technology professionals working in global teams, as it affects communication styles, decision-making processes, and collaboration expectations across different cultural contexts.</p>
