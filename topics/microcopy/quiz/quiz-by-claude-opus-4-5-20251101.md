  <p>To guide and assist users through their interactions with clarity and direction</p>
  <p>Microcopy refers to the small, concise blocks of text—such as labels, instructions, error messages, tooltips, and button texts—that help users navigate digital interfaces. Its purpose is to provide clarity, direction, and feedback, not to fill space or demonstrate technical complexity. Effective microcopy is user-focused, contextually relevant, and helps users complete their tasks successfully.</p>
