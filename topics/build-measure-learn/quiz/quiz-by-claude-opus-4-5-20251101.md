  <p>To quickly iterate and improve products based on customer feedback and data</p>
  <p>The Build-Measure-Learn framework, rooted in the lean startup methodology, emphasizes rapid experimentation and iterative product development. By building a minimum viable product (MVP), measuring user interactions and key metrics, and learning from the insights gained, teams can continuously improve their product's fit with target market needs while reducing the risk of developing something customers don't want.</p>
