  <p>Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team</p>
  <p>The Scrum framework specifically defines these three roles: the Product Owner represents stakeholder interests and manages the product backlog; the Scrum Master facilitates the process and removes impediments; and the Development Team creates the product increment.
