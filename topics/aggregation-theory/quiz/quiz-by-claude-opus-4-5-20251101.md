  <p>Building platforms that aggregate demand or supply to create network effects</p>
  <p>Aggregation theory, introduced by Ben Thompson, states that the most successful companies in the digital economy are those that build platforms aggregating large numbers of consumers or suppliers. This creates powerful network effects that make it difficult for competitors to enter the market.
