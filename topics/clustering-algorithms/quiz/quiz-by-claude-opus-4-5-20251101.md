  <p>DBSCAN</p>
  <p>DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) groups data points that are closely packed and labels outliers as noise. Unlike K-Means or GMM, which require you to specify the number of clusters (K) upfront, DBSCAN automatically determines the number of clusters based on the density of data points. This makes it particularly useful when you don't know how many clusters exist in your data or when dealing with datasets containing noise and outliers.</p>
