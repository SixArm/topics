Question: What is the primary emphasis of Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology that distinguishes it from traditional software development approaches?

- [ ] Extensive documentation and detailed upfront planning before any coding begins
- [ ] Strict adherence to fixed requirements throughout the entire project lifecycle
- [ ] Prototyping and user feedback to quickly build software that meets user needs
- [ ] Sequential phases where each phase must be fully completed before the next begins

  <p>Prototyping and user feedback to quickly build software that meets user needs</p>
  <p>RAD is an iterative methodology that emphasizes speed and flexibility by focusing on building working prototypes quickly and incorporating continuous user feedback. This approach allows teams to rapidly test and refine software while ensuring it meets actual user requirements, making it particularly valuable when requirements are changing or quick time-to-market is essential.</p>
