  <p>Ensuring all individuals and communities can access and effectively use digital technologies to participate in the digital world</p>
  <p>Digital inclusion is fundamentally about equity and access. It encompasses multiple dimensions including connectivity, digital skills and literacy, accessibility for people with disabilities, relevant content and services, and digital citizenship. For technology professionals, understanding this holistic view is essential when designing systems, services, and policies that serve diverse populations rather than excluding marginalized groups.</p>
