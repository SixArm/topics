  <p>To provide fast, reliable feedback on code changes and detect defects early</p>
  <p>Test automation serves as a critical enabler of agile principles by providing fast, reliable feedback on code changes. Automated unit tests, integration tests, and regression suites enable teams to detect defects early in the development cycle. This immediate feedback loop supports the agile goal of maintaining working software throughout the development process, especially given agile's emphasis on rapid iterations, continuous feedback, and frequent releases.</p>
