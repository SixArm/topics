## Devaux's Index of Project Performance (DIPP)

Devaux's Index of Project Performance (DIPP) is a project management metric developed by Stephen Devaux that measures how effectively a project converts resources into business value. Unlike traditional metrics that focus narrowly on schedule, scope, and budget adherence, DIPP provides a value-centric view of project health by incorporating the actual business benefits delivered.

## Why DIPP Matters

Traditional project metrics suffer from a fundamental limitation: they measure conformance to plan rather than actual value creation. A project can be on time, within budget, and meet all specified requirements—yet still deliver minimal business value. Conversely, a project that exceeds its budget might generate extraordinary returns that dwarf the additional investment.

DIPP addresses this gap by asking a more meaningful question: **How efficiently is this project converting invested resources into business value?**

This perspective is particularly valuable for:

- **Prioritization decisions** — Comparing the relative value generation of different projects or features
- **Resource allocation** — Directing investment toward highest-value opportunities
- **Scope adjustments** — Making informed trade-offs when requirements change
- **Stakeholder communication** — Providing meaningful performance indicators beyond completion percentages

## The DIPP Formula

DIPP is calculated as a ratio:

**DIPP = Expected Monetary Value (EMV) ÷ Estimated Cost to Complete (ECC)**

| Component | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)** | The total business value the project is expected to generate, adjusted for probability and time value |
| **Estimated Cost to Complete (ECC)** | The remaining investment required to finish the project, including labor, infrastructure, and opportunity costs |

A DIPP value greater than 1.0 indicates the project is expected to generate more value than its remaining cost—a positive investment. A value below 1.0 suggests the project may not justify continued investment.

## Interpreting DIPP Values

| DIPP Range | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **> 2.0** | Strong value generation; excellent investment | Continue with confidence; consider additional resources |
| **1.5 - 2.0** | Good performance; solid return expected | Maintain current approach; monitor for improvements |
| **1.0 - 1.5** | Marginal performance; borderline justification | Review scope and approach; look for efficiency gains |
| **0.5 - 1.0** | Poor value ratio; investment at risk | Serious reassessment needed; consider scope reduction |
| **< 0.5** | Value destruction likely | Evaluate cancellation or fundamental restructuring |

## DIPP vs. Traditional Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Limitation |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Schedule Variance** | Deviation from planned timeline | Ignores whether delivered work has value |
| **Cost Variance** | Deviation from planned budget | A project can be under budget yet worthless |
| **Earned Value** | Work completed vs. planned | Measures output, not outcomes |
| **Velocity** | Rate of story completion | No connection to business impact |
| **DIPP** | Value generated per resource invested | Requires estimation of business value |

DIPP complements rather than replaces these metrics. Traditional measures remain useful for operational tracking, while DIPP provides strategic insight into whether that operational activity is worthwhile.

## Applying DIPP in Agile Environments

DIPP aligns naturally with agile principles by:

- **Emphasizing value delivery** over plan conformance
- **Supporting iterative reassessment** as new information emerges
- **Enabling pivot decisions** when projects fail to generate expected value
- **Encouraging prioritization** of high-value work items

In practice, agile teams can calculate DIPP at various levels:

- **Project level** — Overall initiative health
- **Epic level** — Comparing major feature investments
- **Sprint level** — Evaluating recent delivery efficiency
- **Feature level** — Informing backlog prioritization

## Challenges and Considerations

Implementing DIPP requires acknowledging several practical challenges:

- **Value estimation difficulty** — Quantifying expected monetary value is inherently uncertain, particularly for innovative or experimental work
- **Opportunity cost calculation** — Determining the cost of delayed delivery requires market and competitive analysis
- **Organizational readiness** — Teams accustomed to output-focused metrics may resist value-based accountability
- **Data collection overhead** — Tracking the inputs requires discipline and tooling

Despite these challenges, the discipline of estimating business value—even imperfectly—often yields insights more valuable than the metric itself. The exercise forces stakeholders to articulate assumptions about value creation that might otherwise remain implicit and untested.

## Practical Implementation Steps

1. **Define value metrics** — Establish how business value will be quantified (revenue impact, cost savings, risk reduction, strategic enablement)
2. **Estimate project EMV** — Work with stakeholders to project expected business outcomes, applying probability adjustments for uncertainty
3. **Track actual costs** — Capture development costs, including labor, infrastructure, and opportunity costs of delayed delivery
4. **Calculate DIPP regularly** — Recalculate as estimates refine and costs accumulate
5. **Use trends, not snapshots** — Monitor DIPP trajectory over time to identify improving or deteriorating performance
6. **Integrate into decision-making** — Incorporate DIPP into portfolio reviews, resource allocation discussions, and go/no-go decisions

## Key Takeaways

- DIPP measures project efficiency in terms of value creation, not just output delivery
- A DIPP above 1.0 indicates positive expected returns; below 1.0 signals concern
- The metric is particularly valuable for prioritization, resource allocation, and scope decisions
- Calculating DIPP requires estimating business value, which is challenging but valuable
- DIPP complements traditional metrics by adding a strategic value perspective
- Regular recalculation enables dynamic portfolio management as conditions change

DIPP represents a shift from asking "Are we building the project right?" to "Are we building the right project?"—a question that ultimately determines whether project management effort translates into organizational success.
