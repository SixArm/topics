  <p>How efficiently a project converts resources into business value</p>
  <p>DIPP measures how efficiently a project converts resources into business value, accounting for both the direct costs of development and the opportunity costs of delayed delivery. This contrasts with traditional project metrics that focus solely on schedule, scope, and budget, making DIPP particularly valuable for agile environments where iterative delivery and maximizing business value are prioritized over simply meeting predetermined specifications.</p>
