# Devaux's Index of Project Performance (DIPP): Tutorial

## Overview

Devaux's Index of Project Performance (DIPP) is a metric developed by Stephen Devaux that evaluates project success by incorporating the business value delivered, not just schedule, scope, and budget adherence. DIPP provides a more holistic view of project performance by measuring how efficiently a project converts resources into business value.

## Why DIPP Matters

### Beyond the Iron Triangle

Traditional project metrics focus on the "iron triangle" of scope, schedule, and budget. A project is considered successful if it delivers the specified scope, on time, within budget. But this view misses a fundamental question: did the project deliver business value?

A project can be on time, on budget, and on scope—and still be a failure if it builds something nobody needs. Conversely, a project that goes over budget but delivers transformative business value may be a resounding success. DIPP addresses this gap.

### Value-to-Cost Ratio

DIPP measures how efficiently a project converts its investment (cost) into business value. This ratio accounts for:

- **Direct development costs**: The resources spent building the product
- **Opportunity costs of delayed delivery**: The business value lost by not delivering sooner
- **Actual business value delivered**: The measurable benefit the project produces

## How DIPP Works

DIPP is calculated by dividing the expected monetary value (EMV) of the project by the cost of the project. This gives a ratio that indicates whether the project is generating more value than it consumes.

- **DIPP > 1.0**: The project is generating more value than it costs—it is a good investment
- **DIPP = 1.0**: The project is breaking even
- **DIPP < 1.0**: The project is costing more than the value it delivers—it should be reevaluated

### Key Factors in the Calculation

- **Expected monetary value**: The estimated business value of the project's deliverables
- **Total project cost**: All costs including labor, infrastructure, tools, and overhead
- **Time sensitivity**: How the value of the deliverable changes over time (delayed delivery often reduces value)

## Applying DIPP in Agile Environments

### Prioritization

DIPP helps teams and portfolio managers prioritize projects and features by their value-to-cost ratio. Features with higher DIPP scores deliver more value per unit of investment and should be prioritized.

### Resource Allocation

When allocating resources across multiple projects, DIPP provides a rational basis for comparison. Resources should flow toward projects with higher DIPP scores.

### Scope Decisions

When deciding whether to add or remove scope, DIPP helps evaluate the trade-off. Adding a feature that increases value more than it increases cost improves the DIPP score. Adding a feature that costs more than the value it delivers reduces the score.

### Stop/Continue Decisions

If a project's DIPP score drops below 1.0, it may be time to stop or redirect the project rather than continuing to invest in diminishing returns.

## Practical Steps

1. **Estimate business value explicitly**: Before starting a project or feature, quantify its expected business value in monetary terms. This forces rigorous thinking about why the work matters.
2. **Track costs comprehensively**: Include all costs—not just direct development costs, but also opportunity costs, infrastructure, and overhead.
3. **Account for time sensitivity**: Recognize that many projects lose value as delivery is delayed. Factor this into the DIPP calculation.
4. **Recalculate regularly**: As costs accumulate and value estimates change, update the DIPP score to inform ongoing decisions.
5. **Use DIPP alongside other metrics**: DIPP provides a value perspective that complements delivery metrics (velocity, cycle time) and quality metrics (defect rate, test coverage).

## Limitations

- **Difficulty quantifying value**: Estimating the monetary value of a project or feature is inherently uncertain, especially for innovative or exploratory work
- **Subjectivity in value estimates**: Different stakeholders may assign different values to the same deliverable
- **Not suitable for all contexts**: Some projects (compliance, security, infrastructure) deliver value that is difficult to express in monetary terms

## Key Takeaway

DIPP shifts the conversation about project performance from "Did we deliver on time and on budget?" to "Did we deliver enough value to justify the investment?" This value-centric perspective aligns project management with business strategy and supports better decisions about prioritization, resource allocation, and whether to continue or stop a project.
