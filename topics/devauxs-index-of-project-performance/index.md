# Devaux's Index of Project Performance (DIPP)

Devaux's Index of Project Performance (DIPP) is a comprehensive metric developed by Stephen Devaux to evaluate project success in agile and software engineering environments. DIPP incorporates the business value delivered by the project, providing a more holistic view of project performance. This constrasts with project metrics that focus solely on schedule, scope, and budget.

DIPP measures how efficiently a project converts resources into business value, accounting for both the direct costs of development and the opportunity costs of delayed delivery. This approach is particularly valuable in agile environments where iterative delivery and changing requirements are common.

DIPP is especially useful for software engineering projects where traditional metrics may not capture the true impact of technical decisions, refactoring efforts, or architectural changes. By quantifying the value-to-cost ratio over time, teams can make more informed decisions about prioritization, resource allocation, and scope adjustments.

DIPP supports agile principles by encouraging teams to focus on delivering maximum business value rather than simply meeting predetermined specifications. It provides stakeholders with a clear understanding of project performance that goes beyond simple completion percentages or budget adherence. This comprehensive approach enables better decision-making throughout the project.
