# YAML Ain't Markup Language

Question: What is the relationship between YAML and JSON?

- [ ] YAML and JSON are completely unrelated data formats with different purposes
- [ ] YAML is a superset of JSON, sharing features like key-value pairs while adding support for comments and multi-line strings
- [ ] JSON is a superset of YAML with additional security features
- [ ] YAML was created to replace JSON entirely and does not support JSON syntax

  <p>YAML is a superset of JSON, sharing features like key-value pairs while adding support for comments and multi-line strings</p>
  <p>YAML extends JSON by being a superset that includes all JSON features (key-value pairs, lists, arrays) while adding more flexibility with a simpler, more human-readable syntax. Unlike JSON, YAML supports comments and multi-line strings, making it particularly well-suited for configuration files and other human-readable data formats.</p>
