  <p>Commission or transaction fees that impact profitability</p>
  <p>Sellers on marketplace platforms must pay commission or transaction fees on each sale made through the platform, which directly impacts their profit margins. This is a fundamental trade-off: while marketplaces provide access to larger audiences and lower overhead costs, they charge fees that reduce seller profitability on each transaction.</p>
