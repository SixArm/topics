# What is this book?

The AI Starter Guide is a glossary-style ebook designed to give technology professionals a fast, practical grounding in artificial intelligence concepts. Each topic occupies a single page, written to be self-contained and readable in any order. The guide draws its material from real-world AI projects across organizations of all sizes, making it a pragmatic reference rather than an academic textbook. This tutorial walks through the guide's purpose, intended audiences, structure, and companion resources so you can get the most out of it.

## Purpose and Design Philosophy

The AI Starter Guide exists to close the vocabulary and conceptual gap that frequently emerges when technical and non-technical stakeholders collaborate on AI initiatives. Rather than deep theoretical treatment, it prioritizes clarity, brevity, and immediate applicability.

The core design decisions are:

- **One topic per page.** Each entry is self-contained. There are no mandatory prerequisites or required reading sequences.
- **Real-world origin.** Every topic was selected because it surfaced in an actual project with actual stakeholders, not because it appeared on a syllabus.
- **Grouped sections.** Related topics are clustered together. For instance, a section on AI plus business sectors groups entries on fintech, govtech, medtech, and similar verticals so readers can absorb a domain quickly.
- **Open ordering.** You can start anywhere. The guide functions as a reference you pull from the shelf when a specific term or concept comes up, not as a linear course.

## Who Should Use This Guide

The guide serves three distinct audiences. Each gets different value from the same material.

| Audience | Primary Benefit | Example Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Project leaders | Quickly teach stakeholders AI terminology and concepts | Share relevant topic pages before a planning session on LLM adoption |
| Project stakeholders | Get up to speed on AI vocabulary to collaborate more effectively | Read key entries before a sprint review involving an ML pipeline |
| Students and educators | Bridge the gap between academic study and industry practice | Prepare for job interviews involving AI-related roles |

Project leaders benefit from having a ready-made communication tool. Instead of writing custom explanations for every new concept introduced to a team, they can point stakeholders to the relevant page and use it as a starting point for discussion. The guide explicitly encourages excerpting, remixing, and sharing pages with coworkers.

Project stakeholders, including product managers, designers, executives, and other non-engineering roles, gain the shared vocabulary necessary to participate meaningfully in technical decisions. Knowing the right terminology reduces misunderstanding and accelerates collaboration.

Students gain exposure to the concepts and language that employers expect. The guide captures industry techniques and practices that academic programs often cover only in passing, giving students a concrete advantage in interviews and early-career roles.

## Why Shared AI Vocabulary Matters

The guide's author draws on years of experience delivering AI projects across a wide range of clients, from small startups to large enterprises. Two recurring themes motivate the guide's existence.

**Team collaboration.** Shared context and clear communication accelerate project work. One enterprise client described the effect as "singing from the same songbook." When every team member can reference the same concise definitions and explanations, alignment happens faster, plans improve, and fewer meetings are spent re-explaining fundamentals.

**Cross-cultural communication.** Teams today span countries, industries, and professional backgrounds. A product manager from a healthcare background and an engineer from a fintech background may use the same words to mean different things. A common glossary provides a neutral baseline, reducing friction and misinterpretation. This is especially valuable in globally distributed teams where English may be a second language for many participants.

## How the Guide Is Structured

The structural principles are straightforward:

- **Flat hierarchy.** There is no chapter-and-section nesting. Every topic is a peer of every other topic.
- **Section grouping.** Topics that share a theme are placed near each other in the table of contents. This is a navigational convenience, not a dependency chain.
- **No cross-reference requirement.** Each page stands alone. You will never need to flip to another page to understand the one you are reading.
- **Community-driven expansion.** The author actively solicits suggestions for new topics and new groupings, keeping the guide aligned with what practitioners actually encounter.

This structure makes the guide particularly well-suited as a just-in-time learning resource. When a term comes up in a meeting or a Slack thread, you look it up, read a single page, and return to work with a solid understanding.

## Companion Guides

The AI Starter Guide is part of a family of four guides. Each covers a different domain but follows the same one-topic-per-page format.

| Guide | Focus Area | Key Topics |
|---|---|---|
| AI Starter Guide | Artificial intelligence concepts and practices | LLMs, neural networks, AI business applications, machine learning techniques |
| Startup Business Guide | Entrepreneurship and company building | Pitch decks, product-market fit, MVP, venture capital, legal entities, sales and marketing |
| UI/UX Design Guide | User interface design and user experience development | User-Centered Design, Information Architecture, task analysis, mockups, accessibility, internationalization |
| Business Lingo Guide | Workplace terminology and cross-cultural communication | Aphorisms like Conway's Law, idioms like "unknown unknowns", industry quotations |

All four guides are available through Gumroad and GitHub. The Business Lingo Guide pairs particularly well with the AI Starter Guide for teams where cross-cultural communication is a factor, as it covers the idiomatic language that often surrounds technical discussions in US-oriented workplaces.

## Getting the Most Out of the Guide

For technology professionals, the following practices maximize the guide's value:

- **Use it as onboarding material.** When a new team member joins an AI project, assign relevant topic pages as pre-reading. This gets everyone to a shared baseline without requiring senior engineers to deliver repeated introductions.
- **Reference it in documentation.** Link to specific topic pages from internal wikis, design documents, or project charters to provide definitions without cluttering your own documents.
- **Contribute back.** If you encounter a concept in your work that the guide does not cover, suggest it to the author. The guide evolves based on practitioner input.
- **Combine guides.** If your AI project involves startup dynamics or significant UI/UX work, pull in the companion guides to cover those dimensions with the same consistent format.

## Related

After reading the AI Starter Guide introduction, consider exploring topics on large language models, neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, AI alignment, AI agents, and AI applications across business sectors such as fintech, medtech, adtech, and edtech. The companion Startup Business Guide and UI/UX Design Guide are also valuable next steps if your AI work intersects with product development or user-facing design.

## Summary

The AI Starter Guide is a practitioner-oriented glossary that delivers one AI concept per page, drawn from real-world project experience. It serves project leaders who need to communicate AI concepts to stakeholders, team members who need shared vocabulary for effective collaboration, and students who need industry-relevant knowledge for career advancement. Its flat, self-contained structure makes it a just-in-time reference rather than a sequential textbook, and its companion guides extend the same approach to startup business, UI/UX design, and business terminology.
