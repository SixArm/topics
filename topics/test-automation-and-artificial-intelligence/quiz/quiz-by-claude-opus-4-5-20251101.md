# Test automation and artificial intelligence

Question: What is a key advantage of combining artificial intelligence with test automation?

- [ ] AI requires manual updates whenever the user interface changes
- [ ] AI eliminates the need for any human involvement in quality assurance
- [ ] AI can automatically update test scripts when user interfaces change, reducing test brittleness
- [ ] AI testing tools only work with pixel-based visual comparisons

  <p>AI can automatically update test scripts when user interfaces change, reducing test brittleness</p>
  <p>One of the significant benefits of AI-enhanced test automation is its ability to automatically update test scripts when user interfaces change. Traditional automated tests are often brittle, meaning they break easily when UI elements are modified. AI addresses this maintenance burden by intelligently adapting to interface changes, which reduces the time and effort required to keep test suites functional and reliable.</p>
