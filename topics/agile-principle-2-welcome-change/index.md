# Agile principle 2: Welcome change

"Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."

Traditional software development methodologies often view changing requirements as disruptive obstacles that increase costs and delay delivery. However, agile reframes this perspective by positioning change as a strategic opportunity rather than a problem to be avoided. In today's dynamic environments, requirements will inevitably evolve as customers gain deeper insights into their needs and market conditions shift.

Agile processes are specifically designed to accommodate and leverage these changes throughout the development lifecycle. Rather than locking in requirements early and resisting modifications, Agile teams maintain flexibility through short iterations, continuous feedback loops, and adaptive planning. This approach enables organizations to respond quickly to new opportunities, competitive threats, or emerging customer insights that could provide significant business value.

The competitive advantage emerges from this responsiveness. While competitors using rigid methodologies may be locked into outdated features or miss market opportunities, Agile teams can pivot quickly to address new requirements. Late-stage changes, which might derail traditional projects, become opportunities to incorporate fresh market intelligence or innovative ideas that differentiate the product.

This principle requires a  shift in mindset from development teams and stakeholders. Teams must build systems and processes that support change. Customers and business stakeholders must embrace iterative refinement over comprehensive upfront planning. Success depends on maintaining open communication channels, establishing clear change evaluation criteria, and balancing responsiveness with stability.
