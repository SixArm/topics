  <p>To harness change for the customer's competitive advantage</p>
  <p>Agile Principle 2 states: "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage." While competitors using rigid methodologies may be locked into outdated features or miss market opportunities, Agile teams can pivot quickly to incorporate fresh market intelligence or innovative ideas that differentiate the product. This responsiveness transforms late-stage changes from potential disruptions into strategic opportunities for delivering greater business value.</p>
