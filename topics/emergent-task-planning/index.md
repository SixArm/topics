# Emergent Task Planning (ETP)

Emergent Task Planning (ETP) is a time management and productivity framework
developed by Francis Seah. It is designed to help individuals effectively manage
their tasks and maximize productivity in dynamic and unpredictable environments.

**Principles**:

* **Emergent Goals**: ETP encourages individuals to focus on emergent goals
rather than rigidly adhering to predefined objectives. Emergent goals are
flexible and responsive to changes in circumstances, allowing individuals to
adapt their goals in real-time based on evolving needs and priorities.

* **Dynamic Prioritization**: ETP acknowledges that traditional task planning
methods don't work well when priorities frequently shift or unexpected tasks
arise. Instead of rigidly sticking to a predefined task list, ETP emphasizes
task management flexibility and prioritization adaptability.

* **Task Chunking**: ETP advocates for breaking down tasks into smaller,
manageable chunks to make them more achievable and less overwhelming. By
breaking tasks into smaller components, individuals can make progress
incrementally and maintain momentum.

* **Just-in-Time Planning**: Instead of planning tasks far in advance, ETP
emphasizes a "just-in-time" planning approach, where tasks are planned and
executed as needed. This approach minimizes time spent on planning and allows
individuals to focus on taking action and making progress.

* **Feedback and Reflection**: ETP encourages individuals to regularly reflect
on their progress, learn from their experiences, and adjust their strategies
accordingly. By seeking feedback and evaluating their performance, individuals
can identify areas for improvement and refine their approach to task management.
