  <p>It focuses on emergent goals and dynamic prioritization that adapt to changing circumstances</p>
  <p>ETP's core philosophy centers on flexibility and adaptability. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed plans and predefined objectives, ETP encourages emergent goals that respond to real-time changes, dynamic prioritization when priorities shift or unexpected tasks arise, and just-in-time planning rather than planning far in advance. This makes ETP particularly effective in dynamic and unpredictable environments.</p>
