# Monte Carlo testing

Question: What is the primary advantage of Monte Carlo testing for complex software systems?

- [ ] It guarantees 100% code coverage through systematic test case generation
- [ ] It eliminates the need for probability distributions in test design
- [ ] It reveals vulnerabilities under specific condition combinations that exhaustive testing cannot practically cover
- [ ] It reduces computational resource requirements compared to traditional testing

  <p>It reveals vulnerabilities under specific condition combinations that exhaustive testing cannot practically cover</p>
  <p>Monte Carlo testing uses random sampling to explore a wide statistical space of system behaviors, making it particularly valuable for complex systems where the vast number of possible input combinations makes exhaustive testing impractical. This probabilistic approach can uncover issues that occur under specific combinations of conditions that might be missed by traditional deterministic testing methods.</p>
