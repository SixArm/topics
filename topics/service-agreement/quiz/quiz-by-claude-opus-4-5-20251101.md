  <p>To establish clear expectations and minimize misunderstandings about the services to be provided</p>
  <p>The Scope of Work section defines the specific services the provider will deliver and should be as detailed as possible to ensure both parties have a clear understanding of what is expected. This directly supports the overall purpose of a service agreement: minimizing the risk of misunderstandings or disputes between the parties.</p>
