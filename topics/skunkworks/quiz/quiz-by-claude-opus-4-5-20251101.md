  <p>A group given high autonomy and resources to work on breakthrough innovations</p>
  <p>Skunkworks describes a team within an organization that operates with a high degree of autonomy, often outside normal organizational structures and processes. These small, highly skilled teams are given freedom to explore new ideas, take risks, and experiment with approaches that might not be feasible in a more structured environment—with the goal of developing breakthrough technology or solving complex problems.</p>
