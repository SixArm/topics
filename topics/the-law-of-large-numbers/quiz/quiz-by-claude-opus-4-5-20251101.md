# The Law of Large Numbers

Question: What happens to the sample mean as the sample size of a statistical population increases?

- [ ] The sample mean becomes less predictable due to increased random variation
- [ ] The sample mean converges to the population mean
- [ ] The sample mean diverges from the population mean
- [ ] The sample mean remains constant regardless of sample size

  <p>The sample mean converges to the population mean</p>
  <p>The Law of Large Numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean becomes a more accurate estimate of the true population mean. While there is always some degree of sampling error, this error becomes smaller as the sample size grows, causing the sample mean to converge toward the population mean.</p>
