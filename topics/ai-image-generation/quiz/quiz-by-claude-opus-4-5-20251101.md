  <p>Control and manipulation</p>
  <p>Advanced AI image generation techniques allow for control and manipulation of generated images. By modifying input parameters or vectors that represent certain features, users can influence the generated image's characteristics, such as its color, shape, or content. This is distinct from style transfer (which applies artistic styles) and represents a key practical capability for technology professionals working with generative AI systems.</p>
