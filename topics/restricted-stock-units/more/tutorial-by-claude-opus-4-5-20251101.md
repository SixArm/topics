## Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) are a form of equity compensation that technology companies widely use to attract, retain, and motivate employees. RSUs represent a contractual promise from your employer to deliver actual company shares to you at a future date, contingent upon meeting specific conditions—typically continued employment over a defined period.

## How RSUs Work

When you receive an RSU grant, you are not immediately given shares. Instead, you receive a promise that shares will transfer to you according to a vesting schedule. The process follows this sequence:

1. **Grant**: Your employer awards you a specific number of RSUs
2. **Vesting**: Units convert to actual shares over time as you meet vesting conditions
3. **Settlement**: Vested shares are delivered to your brokerage account
4. **Ownership**: You now own real company stock and can hold or sell it

The vesting schedule determines when RSUs become actual shares. Most technology companies use a four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff. This means no shares vest until your first anniversary, at which point 25% vest, with the remaining 75% vesting monthly or quarterly over the next three years.

## RSUs vs Stock Options

| Characteristic | RSUs | Stock Options |
|----------------|------|---------------|
| What you receive | Actual shares at vesting | Right to buy shares at a set price |
| Value at grant | Always has value (current stock price × units) | May have zero value if stock price falls below strike price |
| Exercise required | No | Yes—must pay strike price to obtain shares |
| Risk level | Lower—guaranteed value if stock has any worth | Higher—can become worthless if stock declines |
| Upfront cost | None | Must pay exercise price |
| Tax timing | Taxed at vesting | Taxed at exercise (ISOs) or exercise and sale (NSOs) |
| Dilution impact | Fixed number of shares | May receive more shares if exercising when price is low |

## Vesting Schedules

Technology companies employ several vesting structures:

**Time-based vesting** is the most common approach. Your RSUs vest as you complete specified periods of employment. Standard configurations include:

- **4-year with 1-year cliff**: 25% vests after year one, then monthly or quarterly thereafter
- **4-year graded**: Equal portions vest annually (25% per year)
- **3-year graded**: Equal portions vest annually (33.3% per year)
- **Back-weighted**: Smaller percentages vest early, larger percentages vest later (common at Amazon)

**Performance-based vesting** ties some or all RSU vesting to achieving specific business metrics such as revenue targets, stock price thresholds, or operational milestones.

**Hybrid vesting** combines time and performance conditions, requiring both continued employment and achievement of goals.

## Tax Implications

RSUs trigger tax obligations at specific events. Understanding these is critical for financial planning.

**At vesting**: When RSUs vest, the fair market value of the shares is treated as ordinary income. This amount is added to your W-2 wages and taxed at your marginal income tax rate, which can reach 37% federally plus state taxes. Your employer is required to withhold taxes, which they typically accomplish through one of these methods:

- **Sell-to-cover**: The company sells a portion of your vested shares to cover tax withholding
- **Net settlement**: The company withholds shares equivalent to your tax obligation
- **Cash payment**: You pay cash to cover taxes (rare)

**At sale**: When you eventually sell your shares, any gain above the fair market value at vesting is treated as a capital gain. If you held the shares for more than one year after vesting, this qualifies as a long-term capital gain (taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income). Shares sold within one year of vesting incur short-term capital gains taxed at ordinary income rates.

## RSUs at Public vs Private Companies

| Factor | Public Company RSUs | Private Company RSUs |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Liquidity | Can sell immediately after vesting | Cannot sell until liquidity event (IPO, acquisition) |
| Valuation | Clear market price | 409A valuation (may differ from actual value) |
| Tax timing | Taxed at vesting based on market price | Taxed at vesting based on 409A value |
| Risk | Market volatility risk | Company viability risk plus illiquidity |
| Planning | Easier financial planning | Significant uncertainty |

For private company RSUs, you face a challenging situation: taxes are due at vesting, but you cannot sell shares to cover them. This can create cash flow problems, particularly if the company's 409A valuation is high.

## Common RSU Terms

- **Grant date**: The date your employer awards the RSUs to you
- **Cliff**: The minimum period before any vesting occurs
- **Vesting date**: Each date when a portion of RSUs converts to shares
- **Settlement date**: When shares are actually deposited in your account (usually same as vesting date)
- **Double-trigger vesting**: For private companies, RSUs may require both time-based vesting and a liquidity event before shares transfer
- **Acceleration**: Provisions that speed up vesting upon certain events (acquisition, termination without cause)
- **Clawback**: Provisions allowing the company to reclaim vested shares under certain circumstances

## Financial Planning Considerations

**Concentration risk**: If a significant portion of your net worth is in your employer's stock, you face substantial risk if the company underperforms. Many financial advisors recommend holding no more than 10-15% of your portfolio in any single stock.

**Diversification strategy**: Consider selling vested RSUs systematically to diversify your holdings. Strategies include:

- Selling all shares immediately upon vesting
- Selling a fixed percentage at each vesting event
- Setting price targets for selling portions

**Tax planning**: Work with a tax professional to:

- Estimate your tax liability for upcoming vesting events
- Consider timing of sales to manage tax brackets
- Evaluate whether to hold for long-term capital gains treatment
- Plan for Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) implications if applicable

**Cash flow management**: Budget for tax withholding shortfalls. Standard withholding rates (22% federal supplemental rate) often fall short of actual tax liability for higher earners, potentially leaving you with a significant tax bill at filing time.

## RSUs Upon Termination

What happens to your RSUs when you leave the company depends on the vesting status and your departure circumstances:

- **Unvested RSUs**: Typically forfeited entirely—this is the "handcuffs" aspect of equity compensation
- **Vested RSUs**: Already yours as shares; termination does not affect them
- **Termination for cause**: May trigger clawback provisions even for vested shares
- **Acquisition scenarios**: May trigger acceleration or conversion to acquirer's equity

Review your equity agreement carefully to understand the specific terms governing your RSUs.

## Key Takeaways

RSUs represent a significant component of total compensation at technology companies. To maximize their value:

- Understand your vesting schedule and plan around cliff dates
- Estimate and prepare for tax obligations before vesting events
- Develop a diversification strategy to manage concentration risk
- Review your equity agreements for termination and change-of-control provisions
- Consider RSU value when evaluating job offers and comparing total compensation packages

RSUs align employee interests with company performance while providing meaningful value even if stock prices decline—making them a cornerstone of modern technology compensation packages.
