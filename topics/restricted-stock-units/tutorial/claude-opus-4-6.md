# Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) are a form of equity compensation that companies grant to employees, representing a promise to deliver a specific number of company shares at a future date, subject to vesting conditions. RSUs have become one of the most prevalent compensation tools in the technology industry, used by organizations ranging from pre-IPO startups to publicly traded giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. For technology professionals, understanding RSUs is essential because they often constitute a significant portion of total compensation, sometimes exceeding base salary in value.

## How RSUs Work

When a company grants RSUs, it is not immediately transferring shares to the employee. Instead, the grant establishes a contractual right to receive shares once certain conditions are met, typically through a vesting schedule. The lifecycle of an RSU follows a predictable pattern: the company issues a grant specifying the number of units, those units vest over time according to a schedule, and upon vesting, the units convert into actual shares of company stock that the employee owns outright.

Unlike stock options, RSUs do not require the employee to purchase shares at a strike price. There is no exercise decision to make. Once units vest, the employee receives shares (or in some cases, a cash equivalent) automatically. This makes RSUs simpler to understand and less risky than stock options, since they retain value as long as the company's stock price is above zero.

## Vesting Schedules

Vesting schedules determine when RSUs convert from a promise into actual shares. The most common vesting structures in the technology industry are time-based, though performance-based and hybrid models also exist.

| Vesting Type | Description | Common In |
|---|---|---|
| Four-year with one-year cliff | 25% vests after one year, remainder vests monthly or quarterly over the next three years | Large tech companies, startups |
| Four-year annual | 25% vests at the end of each year for four years | Enterprise companies |
| Back-weighted | Lower percentage vests early, higher percentage later (e.g., 5/15/40/40) | Amazon historically used this model |
| Front-weighted | Higher percentage vests early, lower percentage later | Used to improve early retention |
| Performance-based | Vesting tied to company or individual performance milestones | Executive grants, growth-stage companies |

Most technology companies use a four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff. The cliff means that no shares vest during the first year of employment; if the employee leaves before the one-year mark, they forfeit the entire grant. After the cliff, shares typically vest on a monthly or quarterly basis for the remaining three years.

## RSUs vs. Stock Options

RSUs and stock options are both equity compensation instruments, but they differ in fundamental ways that affect their value, risk profile, and tax treatment.

| Factor | RSUs | Stock Options |
|---|---|---|
| Value at grant | Always has value if stock price is above zero | Only has value if stock price exceeds the strike price |
| Employee cost | No purchase required | Employee must pay the strike price to exercise |
| Risk profile | Lower risk; value tracks current stock price | Higher risk; can become worthless if stock falls below strike price |
| Complexity | Simpler; no exercise decisions | More complex; requires decisions about when to exercise |
| Dilution | Generally fewer shares granted due to higher per-unit value | Typically more shares granted at lower per-unit value |
| Early-stage suitability | Less common at early-stage startups | Preferred at early-stage startups for tax advantages |

Stock options were the dominant equity compensation tool in Silicon Valley during the 1990s and early 2000s. RSUs gained prominence after changes in accounting rules (FAS 123R in 2006) required companies to expense stock options, eliminating a key accounting advantage. Today, most large public technology companies use RSUs as their primary equity compensation vehicle, while early-stage startups still favor Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) due to favorable tax treatment under certain conditions.

## Tax Implications

RSU taxation is straightforward compared to stock options, but it carries important nuances that technology professionals must understand to avoid surprises.

- **At grant**: No tax event occurs when RSUs are granted. The grant is simply a promise of future shares.
- **At vesting**: RSUs are taxed as ordinary income at the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date. This is the most significant tax event. The company typically withholds shares to cover federal, state, and FICA taxes, a process called "sell-to-cover."
- **At sale**: If the employee holds the shares after vesting and later sells them, any gain or loss from the vesting-date price is treated as a capital gain or loss. Shares held for more than one year after vesting qualify for long-term capital gains rates; shares held for one year or less are taxed at short-term capital gains rates.
- **Withholding gap**: Many companies withhold at the federal supplemental rate (currently 22% in the US for amounts under $1 million), which may be lower than the employee's actual marginal tax rate. This can result in an unexpected tax bill at filing time.

Technology professionals with significant RSU grants should consider working with a tax advisor to plan for vesting events, especially in years when large tranches vest or when combining RSU income with other compensation.

## Valuation and Total Compensation

In the technology industry, RSUs are a core component of total compensation packages. When evaluating job offers or assessing current compensation, professionals should consider RSUs alongside base salary, annual bonuses, and benefits.

- **Initial grant value**: The grant is typically expressed as a dollar amount divided by the stock price on or near the grant date to determine the number of shares. For example, a $200,000 RSU grant at a stock price of $100 results in 2,000 RSUs.
- **Refresher grants**: Many technology companies provide annual refresher RSU grants to retain employees and offset the declining value of earlier grants as they vest. Refresher grants are a critical factor in long-term compensation.
- **Stock price fluctuation**: Because RSU value is directly tied to the company's stock price, the actual realized value can differ substantially from the grant-date value. A rising stock price increases the value; a falling stock price decreases it.
- **Comparing offers**: When comparing offers between companies, professionals should annualize the RSU grant value over the vesting period and consider the company's stock price trajectory, volatility, and refresher grant practices.

## RSUs at Private Companies

RSUs at private (pre-IPO) companies present unique considerations. Because there is no public market to sell shares, employees who receive vested RSUs at private companies face liquidity constraints.

- **Double-trigger vesting**: Most private companies use double-trigger RSU vesting, which requires both time-based vesting and a liquidity event (such as an IPO or acquisition) before shares are delivered. This defers the tax event until the employee can actually sell shares.
- **Single-trigger vesting**: Some private companies use single-trigger vesting, where shares are delivered upon time-based vesting alone. This creates a tax liability even though the employee cannot easily sell the shares, which can be financially burdensome.
- **409A valuation**: Private company RSUs are valued based on a 409A valuation, an independent appraisal of the company's fair market value. This valuation is typically lower than what the market might ultimately assign at IPO.
- **Secondary markets**: Some employees at late-stage private companies can sell vested shares on secondary markets, but these transactions are subject to company approval and may have restrictions.

## Common Pitfalls

Technology professionals should be aware of several common mistakes and risks associated with RSUs:

- **Concentration risk**: Holding a large portion of net worth in a single company's stock creates significant risk. Diversification after vesting is a prudent strategy.
- **Tax surprises**: Failing to plan for the ordinary income tax at vesting can lead to unexpected tax bills, especially during years with large vesting events.
- **Overvaluing unvested RSUs**: Unvested RSUs are contingent on continued employment. They should not be treated as guaranteed wealth; job changes, layoffs, or company performance can affect their realization.
- **Ignoring refresher grants**: Focusing only on the initial grant without considering the company's refresher grant practices can lead to an inaccurate assessment of long-term compensation.
- **Leaving money on the table**: Departing a company shortly before a vesting cliff means forfeiting shares that were close to vesting. Timing departures around vesting dates is a practical consideration.

Technology professionals exploring RSUs should also study stock options and how they compare in early-stage versus late-stage companies, employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) as a complementary equity benefit, 409A valuations and their role in private company equity, capitalization tables to understand ownership dilution, equity financing rounds and how they affect share value, vesting acceleration provisions in change-of-control scenarios, and tax planning strategies for equity compensation including Section 83(b) elections for restricted stock awards.

## Summary

Restricted Stock Units are a foundational element of compensation in the technology industry, offering employees a direct stake in company value without the complexity and risk of stock options. They vest over time, are taxed as ordinary income upon vesting, and convert into actual shares that employees can hold or sell. Understanding the mechanics of vesting schedules, tax treatment, valuation methods, and the distinction between public and private company RSUs enables technology professionals to make informed decisions about job offers, financial planning, and career transitions. RSUs reward loyalty and align employee interests with company performance, making them a powerful tool for both employers and employees when properly understood.
