  <p>RSUs grant actual shares while stock options grant the right to buy shares at a set price</p>
  <p>RSUs represent a promise to give employees actual company shares once vested, whereas stock options give employees the right to purchase shares at a predetermined price. This fundamental difference makes RSUs generally less risky since their value is tied to the current stock price rather than requiring the stock to exceed a strike price to have value.</p>
