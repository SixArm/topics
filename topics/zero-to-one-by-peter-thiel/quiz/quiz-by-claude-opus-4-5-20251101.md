  <p>Going from "zero to one" by creating something completely new</p>
  <p>The central theme of "Zero to One" is that true innovation means creating something entirely new (going from "zero to one") rather than copying or incrementally improving existing products (going from "one to n"). Thiel argues that entrepreneurs should focus on building unique, valuable offerings that didn't exist before, which is how transformative companies and monopolies are created.</p>
