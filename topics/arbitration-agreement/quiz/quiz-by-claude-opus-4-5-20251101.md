  <p>To specify that disputes will be resolved through arbitration rather than litigation</p>
  <p>An arbitration agreement is a legal agreement that outlines how disputes between parties will be resolved through arbitration—a process using an arbitrator or panel to make binding decisions—rather than through traditional court litigation. This is particularly relevant for technology professionals as many tech contracts include arbitration clauses to handle disputes more efficiently and privately than court proceedings.</p>
