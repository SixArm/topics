  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Power distance</p>
  <p>Power distance is one of Hofstede's six cultural dimensions that specifically measures how a society handles inequalities among people and the extent to which less powerful members accept that power is distributed unequally. This concept is particularly relevant for technology professionals working in global teams, as it influences communication styles, decision-making processes, and organizational hierarchies across different cultures.</p>
