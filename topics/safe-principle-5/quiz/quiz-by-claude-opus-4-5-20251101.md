  <p>Integration points that demonstrate working systems</p>
  <p>SAFe Principle 5 emphasizes that integration points provide objective milestones for evaluating solutions. Unlike traditional phase-gate development models, which experience shows do not mitigate risk as intended, integration points offer concrete evidence of progress through working systems. This approach provides the financial, technical, and fitness-for-purpose governance needed to ensure continuing investment produces a commensurate return.</p>
