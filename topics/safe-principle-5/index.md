# Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems

"Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 5.

Business owners, developers, and customers have a shared responsibility to
ensure that investment in new solutions will deliver economic benefits. The
sequential, phase-gate development model was designed to meet this challenge,
but experience shows that it does not mitigate risk as intended. In Lean-Agile
development, integration points provide objective milestones at which to
evaluate the solution throughout the development life cycle. This regular
evaluation provides the financial, technical, and fitness-for-purpose governance
needed to ensure that a continuing investment will produce a commensurate
return.
