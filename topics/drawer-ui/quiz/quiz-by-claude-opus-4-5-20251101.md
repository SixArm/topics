  <p>To provide a hidden panel that slides into view, offering additional navigation or content without taking up permanent screen space</p>
  <p>A drawer UI (also called a slide-out menu or navigation panel) is designed to optimize screen space by hiding secondary navigation or content behind a collapsible panel. It remains hidden by default, allowing users to focus on primary content, and can be revealed by swiping or tapping—making it particularly valuable for mobile applications where screen real estate is limited.</p>
