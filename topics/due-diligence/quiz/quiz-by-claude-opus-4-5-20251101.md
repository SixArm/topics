  <p>To provide all relevant information needed to make an informed decision about the transaction</p>
  <p>Due diligence is a comprehensive investigation that examines financial, legal, operational, and commercial aspects of a company. Its purpose is to assess both benefits and risks, giving the interested party the information they need to decide whether to proceed with the transaction—not simply to find problems or negotiate price.</p>
