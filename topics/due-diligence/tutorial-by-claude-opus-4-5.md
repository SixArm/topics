# Due Diligence

## What Is Due Diligence?

Due diligence is a comprehensive investigation conducted by an interested party before entering into a business transaction. It involves a systematic examination of the financial, legal, operational, and commercial aspects of a company to assess both benefits and risks. The ultimate goal is to provide all relevant information needed to make an informed decision regarding an investment, acquisition, partnership, or other significant business commitment.

For technology professionals, due diligence is a critical process encountered during mergers and acquisitions, venture capital funding rounds, technology licensing deals, strategic partnerships, and vendor selection. Understanding this process helps you contribute meaningfully when your company is either conducting due diligence or being evaluated.

## Why Due Diligence Matters for Technology Professionals

Technology teams play an increasingly central role in due diligence because:

- **Technology is a core asset** — Software, intellectual property, data infrastructure, and technical talent often represent the primary value in modern transactions
- **Technical debt affects valuation** — Hidden engineering problems can significantly reduce a company's worth
- **Security vulnerabilities create liability** — Undiscovered breaches or compliance gaps can derail transactions
- **Integration complexity determines success** — Post-acquisition technical integration is frequently the largest source of deal failure

## Types of Due Diligence

### Financial Due Diligence

Financial due diligence examines the target company's financial health and the accuracy of its reported metrics.

| Area | What Is Reviewed |
|------|------------------|
| Financial statements | Income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements |
| Revenue recognition | How revenue is calculated, deferred revenue, recurring vs. one-time |
| Tax records | Tax returns, outstanding liabilities, transfer pricing |
| Projections | Assumptions behind forecasts, historical accuracy of predictions |
| Working capital | Current assets, liabilities, cash conversion cycle |

For technology companies, particular attention is paid to metrics like Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), and churn rates.

### Legal Due Diligence

Legal due diligence identifies potential legal risks and liabilities that could impact the transaction.

| Area | What Is Reviewed |
|------|------------------|

| Team | Technical talent, key person dependencies, hiring practices |

## The Due Diligence Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

The acquiring or investing party establishes:

- **Objectives** — What specific questions must be answered?
- **Scope** — Which areas will be examined and to what depth?
- **Team** — Who will conduct each area of investigation?
- **Timeline** — What is the deadline for completing the review?
- **Data room setup** — Where will documents be shared securely?

### Phase 2: Information Gathering

The target company provides:

- Requested documents uploaded to a secure data room
- Access to systems for technical evaluation
- Availability of key personnel for interviews
- Site visits if physical operations are relevant

### Phase 3: Analysis

The due diligence team:

- Reviews all provided documentation
- Conducts interviews with management and key staff
- Performs independent verification where possible
- Identifies gaps, inconsistencies, and red flags
- Quantifies risks and potential remediation costs

### Phase 4: Reporting

Findings are consolidated into:

- **Executive summary** — High-level findings and recommendation
- **Detailed findings** — Comprehensive analysis by category
- **Risk register** — Identified risks with severity and mitigation options
- **SWOT analysis** — Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats

### Phase 5: Negotiation Impact

Due diligence findings typically influence:

- **Valuation adjustments** — Price may increase or decrease based on findings
- **Deal structure** — Earnouts, escrows, or holdbacks may be added
- **Representations and warranties** — Specific guarantees required from the seller
- **Conditions precedent** — Issues that must be resolved before closing

## What Technology Teams Should Prepare

When your company is undergoing due diligence, be ready to provide:

**Documentation**
- System architecture diagrams
- API documentation
- Database schemas
- Security policies and audit reports
- Disaster recovery and business continuity plans
- Incident history and post-mortems

**Access**
- Read-only access to repositories for code review
- Access to monitoring and observability tools
- Security scan results and penetration test reports

**Metrics**
- Uptime and reliability statistics
- Performance benchmarks
- Technical debt inventory
- Test coverage reports
- Deployment frequency and lead time

**Personnel Availability**
- CTO and engineering leadership for strategic discussions
- Senior engineers for deep technical questions
- Security team for compliance and vulnerability discussions

## Common Red Flags in Technical Due Diligence
