# Due diligence

Due diligence is a comprehensive investigation conducted by an interested party before entering into a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition, investment, or partnership. It involves a systematic examination of financial, legal, operational, commercial, and technical aspects of a target company. The goal is to verify claims, uncover risks, and equip decision-makers with the information they need to proceed with confidence or walk away before committing capital, reputation, or resources.

## Why Due Diligence Matters

Due diligence serves as a risk mitigation mechanism. Without it, buyers and investors rely on incomplete or unverified information, exposing themselves to hidden liabilities, inflated valuations, and operational surprises. For technology professionals, due diligence is particularly important because software assets, intellectual property portfolios, technical debt, and engineering team quality can make or break a deal. A thorough process protects all parties, builds trust, and establishes a factual baseline for negotiation.

## Types of Due Diligence

There are several distinct categories of due diligence, each targeting a different dimension of the target organization.

| Type | Focus Area | Key Questions |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Financial | Financial statements, tax returns, revenue recognition, cash flow | Is the reported revenue accurate? Are there undisclosed liabilities? |
| Legal | Contracts, licenses, regulatory filings, litigation history | Are there pending lawsuits or regulatory violations? |
| Operational | Business processes, supply chain, production, organizational structure | Are operations efficient and scalable? |
| Commercial | Market position, competitive landscape, customer base, growth potential | Is the market opportunity real and sustainable? |
| Technical | Codebase quality, architecture, infrastructure, security posture | Is the technology sound, maintainable, and defensible? |
| Human Resources | Key personnel, compensation, culture, retention risk | Will critical talent stay post-transaction? |
| Environmental | Environmental liabilities, compliance with regulations | Are there contamination or remediation obligations? |

## Financial Due Diligence

Financial due diligence examines the target company's financial health and the accuracy of its reported numbers. Investigators review audited financial statements, tax returns, accounts receivable and payable aging reports, debt obligations, and revenue recognition practices. They look for inconsistencies between reported earnings and actual cash flow, one-time revenue events disguised as recurring income, and undisclosed off-balance-sheet liabilities.

Key deliverables include:

- Quality of earnings analysis to distinguish sustainable revenue from non-recurring items
- Working capital assessment to determine normal operating requirements
- Debt and contingent liability inventory
- Tax compliance review and identification of exposure
- Financial projection stress testing

## Legal Due Diligence

Legal due diligence identifies risks embedded in the target's contractual and regulatory landscape. Investigators review corporate formation documents, material contracts with customers and vendors, employment agreements, intellectual property registrations, pending or threatened litigation, and compliance with applicable regulations.

For technology companies, legal due diligence pays special attention to:

- Open source license compliance and potential copyleft exposure
- Patent portfolios and freedom-to-operate analysis
- Data privacy and protection obligations under regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA
- Customer contract terms including service level agreements, liability caps, and termination provisions
- Outstanding or potential intellectual property infringement claims

## Operational Due Diligence

Operational due diligence evaluates how well the target company runs day to day. Investigators examine organizational structure, management capabilities, supply chain dependencies, key vendor relationships, and internal processes. The objective is to identify inefficiencies, single points of failure, and scalability constraints.

Areas of focus include business continuity and disaster recovery plans, dependency on specific individuals or vendors, capacity utilization, and the maturity of internal controls. Operational findings often reveal integration challenges that directly affect post-transaction planning and cost estimates.

## Commercial Due Diligence

Commercial due diligence assesses the target's position in its market and the viability of its growth strategy. Investigators analyze industry dynamics, competitive positioning, customer concentration risk, pricing power, and addressable market size. This type of diligence answers the fundamental question of whether the business opportunity is real and durable.

Key considerations include:

- Customer retention rates and net revenue retention
- Competitive differentiation and barriers to entry
- Market growth trajectory and relevant secular trends
- Sales pipeline quality and conversion metrics
- Channel strategy effectiveness

## Technical Due Diligence

Technical due diligence is critical for technology-driven transactions. It evaluates the quality, scalability, security, and maintainability of the target's technology assets. Investigators review the codebase, system architecture, infrastructure, development practices, and security posture.

| Assessment Area | What Investigators Examine |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Code Quality | Code review findings, test coverage, technical debt levels, documentation |
| Architecture | Scalability, modularity, service boundaries, data flow patterns |
| Infrastructure | Cloud versus on-premises, redundancy, cost efficiency, vendor lock-in |
| Security | Vulnerability history, penetration test results, access controls, incident response |
| Development Practices | CI/CD maturity, release cadence, branching strategy, code review culture |
| Data Management | Data models, migration history, backup and recovery, compliance with data regulations |

Technical due diligence also assesses team capabilities, including the depth and breadth of engineering talent, documentation practices, and knowledge concentration risk.

## The Due Diligence Process

A typical due diligence engagement follows a structured sequence:

- **Scoping**: Define the areas of investigation, allocate resources, and establish timelines based on deal complexity and risk profile.
- **Information Request**: Issue a comprehensive data request list to the target company, covering financial records, legal documents, technical artifacts, and operational data.
- **Data Room Review**: Analyze documents provided in a virtual data room, flagging gaps, inconsistencies, and areas requiring deeper investigation.
- **Management Interviews**: Conduct interviews with executives, department leads, and key technical personnel to validate findings and assess leadership quality.
- **Site Visits**: Where applicable, visit offices, data centers, or production facilities to verify claims and observe operations firsthand.
- **Expert Consultation**: Engage domain specialists for areas such as intellectual property valuation, regulatory compliance, or cybersecurity assessment.
- **Findings Report**: Synthesize all findings into a structured report that identifies risks, quantifies potential liabilities, and recommends mitigations or deal adjustments.
- **Negotiation Support**: Use findings to inform deal terms, price adjustments, representations and warranties, indemnification provisions, and closing conditions.

## Common Red Flags

Experienced investigators watch for warning signs that may indicate deeper problems:

- Reluctance or delays in providing requested information
- Inconsistencies between financial statements and tax filings
- High customer concentration where a small number of clients drive most revenue
- Excessive related-party transactions
- Unresolved litigation or regulatory investigations
- Undocumented or poorly maintained codebases with minimal test coverage
- Key person dependencies without succession plans
- Unusual revenue spikes near reporting period ends
- Incomplete or missing corporate records

## Due Diligence for Different Transaction Types

The scope and emphasis of due diligence varies by transaction type.

| Transaction Type | Primary Focus | Typical Duration |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Merger or Acquisition | All categories, with emphasis on integration feasibility | 4 to 12 weeks |
| Venture Capital Investment | Commercial viability, team quality, technical defensibility | 2 to 6 weeks |
| Private Equity Investment | Financial performance, operational efficiency, growth levers | 4 to 8 weeks |
| Strategic Partnership | Operational compatibility, IP boundaries, cultural alignment | 2 to 4 weeks |
| Licensing Agreement | IP ownership, freedom to operate, contractual obligations | 1 to 3 weeks |

## Related

Technology professionals conducting or supporting due diligence should explore related topics including mergers and acquisitions, business valuation methods such as discounted cash flow and comparable company analysis, intellectual property strategy, risk management frameworks, SWOT analysis, compliance and regulatory requirements such as GDPR and SOC 2, venture capital term sheets, and post-merger integration planning. Understanding these adjacent areas strengthens the ability to contribute meaningfully to the due diligence process.

## Summary

Due diligence is the disciplined process of investigating a target company before committing to a transaction. It spans financial, legal, operational, commercial, technical, and human dimensions, each designed to verify claims and surface hidden risks. For technology professionals, technical due diligence covering code quality, architecture, security, and team capability is particularly consequential. A well-executed process produces a factual foundation for negotiation, protects against costly surprises, and ultimately determines whether a deal should proceed, be restructured, or be abandoned.
