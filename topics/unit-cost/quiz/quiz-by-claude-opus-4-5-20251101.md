  <p>Divide total cost by total units produced</p>
  <p>Unit cost is calculated using the formula: Unit Cost = Total Cost / Total Units. The total cost includes all expenses associated with production (materials, labor, overhead), and dividing by the number of units gives you the cost per individual unit. This metric is essential for pricing decisions and profitability analysis.</p>
