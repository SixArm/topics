  <p>The cathedral model is hierarchical and centralized, while the bazaar model is decentralized and open</p>
  <p>Raymond's essay contrasts the cathedral model—characterized by a tightly controlled, hierarchical development process with limited access to code—against the bazaar model, where development is decentralized, open to many contributors, and lacks top-down control. Raymond argues the bazaar model is more effective because it harnesses collective creativity and can respond quickly to changing needs.</p>
