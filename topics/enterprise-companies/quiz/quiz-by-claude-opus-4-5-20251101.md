  <p>They possess significant resources including financial capital, human capital, and technological capabilities</p>
  <p>Enterprise companies are characterized by their substantial resources across multiple dimensions. Unlike smaller businesses, enterprises have access to significant financial capital for investment and operations, large pools of human capital (employees with diverse skills), and advanced technological capabilities. This resource advantage enables them to develop and implement strategies that can affect their entire industry, operate at national or international levels, and maintain competitive advantages through dedicated departments and specialized enterprise software like ERP systems.</p>
