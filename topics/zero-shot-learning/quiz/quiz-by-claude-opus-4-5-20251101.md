# Zero-shot learning

Question: What is the key capability that distinguishes zero-shot learning from traditional supervised learning?

- [ ] It requires more labeled training data than supervised learning
- [ ] It can only classify examples from classes seen during training
- [ ] It can make predictions for classes never seen during training by using semantic information
- [ ] It eliminates the need for any training data

  <p>It can make predictions for classes never seen during training by using semantic information</p>
  <p>Zero-shot learning enables a model to generalize to new, unseen classes by leveraging auxiliary semantic information (such as attributes or textual descriptions) that links seen and unseen classes. This knowledge transfer allows the model to make predictions on novel classes without requiring labeled examples for those classes, making it valuable when obtaining labeled data for all possible classes is impractical.</p>
