  <p>Subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters</p>
  <p>NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (scores 0-6) from the percentage of promoters (scores 9-10). Passives (scores 7-8) are not included in the calculation. The resulting score ranges from -100 to +100, where a higher score indicates greater customer loyalty and satisfaction.</p>
