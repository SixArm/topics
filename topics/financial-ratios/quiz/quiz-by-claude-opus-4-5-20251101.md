  <p>Liquidity ratios</p>
  <p>Liquidity ratios assess a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and measure its cash flow position. Common liquidity ratios include the current ratio and quick ratio (acid-test ratio). For a technology professional, understanding liquidity is critical when evaluating whether a company has sufficient resources to fund operations, pay vendors, and cover payroll—especially important for startups and growth-stage tech companies that may have significant cash burn.</p>
