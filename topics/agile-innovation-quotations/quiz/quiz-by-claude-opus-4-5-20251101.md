  <p>Creativity is thinking up new things while innovation is doing new things</p>
  <p>Theodore Levitt's quotation captures a fundamental distinction that is highly relevant for technology professionals: creativity is the ideation phase ("thinking up new things"), while innovation requires execution and implementation ("doing new things"). This distinction emphasizes that having ideas alone is insufficient—true innovation requires turning those ideas into tangible outcomes, products, or improvements. For agile teams, this reinforces the importance of iterative delivery and actually shipping working solutions rather than just brainstorming.</p>
