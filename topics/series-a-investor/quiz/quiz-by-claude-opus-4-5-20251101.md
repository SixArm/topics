  <p>The startup has a working prototype or MVP and has demonstrated traction such as customer acquisition or revenue</p>
  <p>Series A funding follows the seed round and targets startups that have moved beyond the initial concept stage. At this point, the company has typically developed a working prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) and has demonstrated some level of traction, such as customer acquisition or revenue generation. This evidence of progress and market validation is what differentiates Series A-ready startups from earlier-stage companies still seeking seed funding.</p>
