## How to Interview a User

Interviewing users is a foundational skill for technology professionals involved in product development, UX design, requirements gathering, and customer research. A well-conducted user interview reveals genuine needs, uncovers hidden pain points, and provides actionable insights that drive better products and services.

## Why User Interviews Matter

User interviews provide qualitative data that surveys and analytics cannot capture. They reveal the "why" behind user behavior, expose unstated assumptions, and surface opportunities for innovation. Direct conversation with users builds empathy within teams and grounds product decisions in real-world context rather than speculation.

| Method | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| User Interviews | Deep insights, context-rich, flexible follow-up | Time-intensive, smaller sample sizes |
| Surveys | Scalable, quantifiable results | Limited depth, no follow-up possible |
| Analytics | Behavioral patterns, large datasets | No explanation of motivation |
| Usability Testing | Observes actual behavior | Artificial environment, task-focused |

## Preparation Phase

Thorough preparation separates productive interviews from meandering conversations that waste everyone's time.

### Define Clear Objectives

Before scheduling any interview, articulate exactly what you need to learn:

- What specific questions must this interview answer?
- What decisions will this research inform?
- What assumptions are you testing or validating?
- What gaps exist in your current understanding?

Write down 3-5 research objectives. Every question in your guide should trace back to one of these objectives.

### Create a Discussion Guide

A discussion guide keeps you focused while allowing natural conversation flow. Structure it with:

- **Introduction script**: Your opening explanation and consent language
- **Warm-up questions**: Low-stakes questions to build rapport
- **Core questions**: 5-10 main questions aligned with your objectives
- **Follow-up prompts**: Pre-prepared probes for each core question
- **Closing protocol**: How you will wrap up and express gratitude

### Determine Logistics

Decide on practical matters before recruiting participants:

- **Format**: In-person, video call, or phone
- **Duration**: Typically 30-60 minutes
- **Recording**: Audio, video, or notes only (with consent)
- **Compensation**: Gift cards, product credits, or other incentives
- **Note-taking**: Dedicated note-taker or solo interviewer

### Prepare Materials

Gather everything you need:

- Discussion guide (printed or accessible digitally)
- Recording equipment and backup
- Consent forms
- Any prototypes, screenshots, or artifacts to discuss
- Participant information and contact details

## Conducting the Interview

### Establish Rapport

The first two minutes set the tone for the entire conversation. Participants who feel comfortable share more openly and honestly.

- Introduce yourself by name and role
- Explain the purpose in plain language
- Clarify that there are no right or wrong answers
- Explain how their input will be used
- Confirm recording consent if applicable
- Ask if they have any questions before starting

A relaxed participant provides richer data than a guarded one.

### Ask Open-Ended Questions

Open-ended questions invite expansive responses. Closed questions yield yes/no answers that shut down exploration.

| Instead of This | Ask This |
|-----------------|----------|
| "Do you like this feature?" | "How do you feel about this feature?" |
| "Is the interface easy to use?" | "Walk me through how you use this interface." |
| "Would you recommend this product?" | "How would you describe this product to a colleague?" |
| "Did you have any problems?" | "Tell me about a time when something didn't work as expected." |

Avoid leading questions that suggest the answer you want. "Don't you think this is better?" biases the response. "How does this compare to what you used before?" invites honest comparison.

### Listen Actively

Active listening requires your full attention. Put away distractions and focus entirely on the participant.

- Maintain appropriate eye contact
- Nod and use verbal acknowledgments ("I see," "Go on")
- Pay attention to tone, pace, and emotional shifts
- Notice non-verbal cues like hesitation or enthusiasm
- Resist the urge to formulate your next question while they speak
- Avoid interrupting, even when you think you understand their point

Silence speaks. If a participant trails off, wait. They often continue with deeper insights after a pause.

### Dig Deeper with Follow-Up Questions

Surface-level answers rarely reveal actionable insights. Use probing questions to uncover the reasoning and context behind initial responses.

Effective follow-up prompts include:

- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "Why do you think that is?"
- "What happened next?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What would have made that situation better?"
- "Walk me through that process step by step."

When a participant says something surprising or contradictory, explore it. These moments often yield the most valuable discoveries.

### Empathize and Seek Context

Understanding the user's world makes their feedback meaningful. Ask about their environment, constraints, and goals.

- What is their role and daily workflow?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What obstacles do they face?
- What tools and resources do they have?
- Who else is involved in their process?
- What does success look like for them?

Context transforms isolated comments into actionable patterns. A complaint about slow performance means different things for someone working in a busy emergency room versus someone browsing casually at home.

### Respect Silence and Pauses

Novice interviewers rush to fill silence. Experienced interviewers use it strategically.

When a participant pauses:

- Wait at least 3-5 seconds before speaking
- They may be gathering thoughts for a more complete answer
- Silence signals that you value thoughtful responses
- Rushing communicates that you want quick, superficial answers

If the pause extends uncomfortably, offer a gentle prompt: "Take your time" or "What are you thinking about?"

## Common Interview Pitfalls

Avoid these mistakes that undermine interview quality:

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Leading questions | Biases responses toward expected answers | Use neutral phrasing |
| Talking too much | Reduces participant response time | Follow the 80/20 rule (they talk 80%) |
| Defending your product | Shuts down honest criticism | Accept all feedback graciously |
| Asking hypothetical questions | Generates unreliable predictions | Focus on past behavior and current reality |
| Jumping to solutions | Misses underlying needs | Stay in problem space, not solution space |
| Taking notes verbatim | Distracts from listening | Record the session or use a dedicated note-taker |

## Types of User Interview Questions

### Behavioral Questions

Focus on what users actually do, not what they might do:

- "Tell me about the last time you [performed relevant task]."
- "How did you handle [specific situation] when it occurred?"
- "Walk me through a typical day when you encounter this problem."

### Opinion and Attitude Questions

Explore feelings and preferences:

- "How do you feel about the current process?"
- "What frustrates you most about [topic]?"
- "What would make your work easier?"

### Comparison Questions

Surface preferences through contrast:

- "How does this compare to other tools you have used?"
- "What is different about how you approached this before versus now?"
- "If you could combine features from different products, what would you choose?"

### Priority Questions

Understand relative importance:

- "Of all the issues you mentioned, which matters most?"
- "If you could fix only one thing, what would it be?"
- "What would you be willing to give up to get [desired feature]?"

## Closing the Interview

End the interview deliberately, not abruptly.

### Summarize Key Insights

Briefly recap what you heard to confirm understanding:

- "Let me make sure I captured this correctly..."
- "The main themes I'm hearing are... Does that sound right?"
- "You mentioned X, Y, and Z as your biggest challenges. Did I miss anything?"

This gives participants the opportunity to correct misunderstandings and add final thoughts.

### Thank the Participant

Express genuine appreciation for their time and candor:

- Acknowledge the value of their specific contributions
- Explain next steps if appropriate
- Provide any promised compensation
- Offer contact information for follow-up questions

### Leave the Door Open

Invite future engagement:

- "May I contact you if I have follow-up questions?"
- "Would you be interested in participating in future research?"
- "Is there anyone else you think I should talk to about this?"

## After the Interview

### Debrief Immediately

Within 30 minutes of the interview, capture your impressions:

- What stood out?
- What surprised you?
- What quotes were most memorable?
- What themes emerged?
- What needs further investigation?

Fresh impressions fade quickly. Document them before starting your next meeting.

### Synthesize Findings

After completing all interviews:

- Review notes and recordings systematically
- Identify patterns across participants
- Document direct quotes that illustrate key themes
- Note areas of disagreement or outlier perspectives
- Create artifacts (personas, journey maps, problem statements) that make findings actionable
