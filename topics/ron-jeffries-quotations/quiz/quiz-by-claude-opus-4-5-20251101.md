  <p>Broken by design</p>
  <p>Ron Jeffries stated "Code without tests is broken by design." This reflects core XP (Extreme Programming) principles, emphasizing that tests are not merely for finding bugs but are essential for creating a foundation for confident, sustainable development where changes can be made safely. Without tests, code lacks the verification needed to ensure it works correctly and can be modified without breaking existing functionality.</p>
