# Ron Jeffries quotations

Ron Jeffries emphasis on simplicity resonates through his famous observation: "We're not paid to use every feature of the language, we're paid to build systems that work." This perspective challenges developers to prioritize functionality over complexity.

Jeffries advocates for incremental progress and continuous improvement, noting that "the best way to get a project done faster is to start sooner." His philosophy extends beyond mere speed, emphasizing sustainable development practices that maintain quality while delivering value consistently.

On the nature of requirements and planning, Jeffries states: "Requirements are like water. They're easier to build on when they're frozen, but they're more valuable when they can flow." This metaphor captures the dynamic nature of software projects and the need for adaptability in development processes.

His perspective on testing reflects XP principles: "Code without tests is broken by design." This isn't merely about finding bugs but about creating a foundation for confident, sustainable development where changes can be made safely.

Jeffries also addresses the human element of software development, recognizing that "the most important thing about a programming language is not what it makes possible, but what it makes easy." This insight acknowledges that tools should serve developers, not burden them.
