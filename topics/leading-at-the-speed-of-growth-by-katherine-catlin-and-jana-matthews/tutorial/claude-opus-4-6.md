# "Leading at the Speed of Growth" by Katherine Catlin and Jana Matthews

## Introduction

"Leading at the Speed of Growth" by Katherine Catlin and Jana Matthews is a foundational book for entrepreneurs, technology leaders, and executives who must navigate the turbulent journey from startup inception to mature enterprise. Drawing on research and interviews with more than 650 CEOs and entrepreneurs, the authors present a practical, stage-based framework for understanding how leadership demands shift as a company grows. For technology professionals in particular, this book addresses a critical gap: the skills that make a founder successful in the earliest days are not the same skills needed to lead a scaling organization, and failing to evolve as a leader is one of the most common reasons high-potential companies stall or collapse.

## The Four Stages of Growth

The core thesis of the book is that company growth follows a predictable arc through four stages, each with distinct characteristics, challenges, and leadership requirements. Understanding which stage your company occupies allows you to anticipate problems, adjust your leadership style, and make better strategic decisions.

| Stage | Primary Focus | Key Challenge | Leadership Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Start-Up | Product/service development and market entry | Survival and finding product-market fit | Hands-on doer |
| Ramp-Up | Scaling operations and building a customer base | Managing rapid change and building teams | Team builder and delegator |
| Scale-Up | Sustaining growth while managing complexity | Maintaining culture and creating scalable systems | Strategic leader and culture steward |
| Maturity | Long-term sustainability and renewal | Avoiding stagnation and fostering innovation | Visionary and organizational architect |

Each transition between stages is a potential failure point. The authors argue that leaders who cling to the habits of a previous stage rather than adopting the behaviors required by the next one become the bottleneck to their own company's growth.

## Start-Up Stage: The Builder

In the start-up stage, the leader is deeply embedded in every aspect of the business. The focus is on developing a viable product or service and getting the company off the ground. Catlin and Matthews identify several essential behaviors for leaders at this stage:

- **Adaptability.** Start-up conditions change rapidly. Leaders must be willing to pivot based on customer feedback, market signals, and technical realities.
- **Decisiveness.** With limited resources and time, the ability to make fast decisions with incomplete information is more valuable than exhaustive analysis.
- **Openness to feedback.** Founders who insulate themselves from criticism, whether from customers, co-founders, or early employees, risk building something nobody wants.
- **Hands-on execution.** At this stage, the leader is often writing code, closing deals, and answering support tickets. There is no delegation because there is no one to delegate to.

For technology professionals, this stage maps closely to the experience of working in a small engineering team where the CTO or technical co-founder is simultaneously architect, developer, and DevOps engineer. The danger is falling in love with this mode and refusing to let go of it as the company grows.

## Ramp-Up Stage: The Team Builder

The ramp-up stage begins when the company has found early traction and needs to scale its operations, team, and customer base. This is often the most chaotic period in a company's life, and it is where many technology companies fail. The authors recommend that leaders focus on:

- **Building and managing teams.** The leader must shift from doing the work to hiring people who can do it, and then managing those people effectively.
- **Establishing processes and systems.** What worked informally with five people breaks down at twenty. Leaders must introduce structure without killing the agility that made the company successful.
- **Communicating vision and strategy.** As the team grows, alignment becomes harder to maintain. Leaders must articulate a clear direction and repeat it constantly.
- **Managing cash flow.** Growth consumes capital. Leaders must understand the financial mechanics of scaling and avoid the trap of growing faster than the business can sustain.

For technology leaders, this stage often coincides with the introduction of formal engineering practices: version control workflows, code review processes, CI/CD pipelines, and on-call rotations. The challenge is implementing these systems in a way that enables speed rather than bureaucracy.

## Scale-Up Stage: The Strategic Leader

In the scale-up stage, the company has established a significant market presence and is managing increasing organizational complexity. The leadership demands shift again:

- **Effective delegation.** Leaders must trust their teams and resist the urge to micromanage. This requires hiring strong managers and giving them genuine authority.
- **Culture as infrastructure.** At this scale, the leader cannot personally influence every employee. Culture, defined through values, norms, and rituals, becomes the mechanism for ensuring consistent behavior across the organization.
- **Scalable business models.** The systems and processes that worked during ramp-up may not survive another order-of-magnitude increase. Leaders must think architecturally about the business itself.
- **Strategic focus.** With more opportunities available, the discipline to say no becomes as important as the ability to execute.

Technology professionals will recognize this stage as the point where engineering organizations introduce platform teams, establish architectural review boards, and invest in internal tooling. The leader's role shifts from building products to building the organization that builds products.

## Maturity Stage: The Visionary

The maturity stage presents a paradox: the company has achieved success, but that success creates the risk of complacency. Catlin and Matthews argue that leaders in this stage must focus on renewal and reinvention:

- **Innovation and adaptation.** Market conditions change, and the technologies or business models that drove initial success will eventually become commoditized. Leaders must invest in new capabilities before the old ones decline.
- **Customer-centric focus.** Mature companies often become internally focused, optimizing for operational efficiency rather than customer value. Leaders must keep the organization oriented toward solving customer problems.
- **Leadership pipeline.** The long-term health of the organization depends on developing the next generation of leaders. This requires deliberate investment in mentoring, succession planning, and leadership development.
- **Organizational learning.** Mature companies must build the capacity to learn from both successes and failures, incorporating those lessons into strategy and operations.

For technology companies, this stage often involves difficult decisions about legacy systems, technical debt, and platform migrations. The leadership challenge is balancing the maintenance of existing revenue-generating systems with investment in future capabilities.

## Leadership Evolution Across Stages

One of the book's most valuable contributions is its clear articulation of how the leader's role must change at each stage. The table below summarizes the dominant leadership activities at each stage.

| Dimension | Start-Up | Ramp-Up | Scale-Up | Maturity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Decision-making | Centralized, intuitive | Increasingly shared | Distributed to teams | Strategic and board-level |
| Hiring focus | Generalists and co-founders | Specialists and first managers | Senior leaders and executives | Successors and innovators |
| Communication | Informal, constant | Structured team meetings | Company-wide systems | Institutional storytelling |
| Primary risk | Building the wrong thing | Growing too fast or too slow | Losing culture and agility | Stagnation and disruption |
| Time horizon | Weeks to months | Quarters | Years | Decades |

The authors stress that this evolution is not optional. Leaders who attempt to run a 500-person company the same way they ran a 5-person startup will create dysfunction and ultimately limit the company's potential.

## The Role of Culture and People

Throughout the book, Catlin and Matthews return to two themes that underpin everything else: culture and people.

**Culture** is not a set of posters on the wall. It is the aggregate of daily decisions, hiring choices, and behavioral norms that determine how work actually gets done. The authors argue that culture must be intentionally designed and actively maintained, especially during periods of rapid growth when new hires can dilute or distort the original values.

**People** are the primary constraint on growth. The authors provide practical guidance on hiring for each stage, noting that the ideal employee profile changes as the company matures. Early-stage companies need resourceful generalists who thrive in ambiguity. Later-stage companies need experienced specialists and managers who can build and run scalable systems. Leaders must also confront the painful reality that some early employees, including co-founders, may not be the right fit for later stages.

## Practical Guidance for Technology Professionals

The book's framework has direct application for technology professionals at every level:

- **Individual contributors** can use the stage model to understand why their company's processes and priorities are changing, and to assess whether their own skills match the company's current needs.
- **Engineering managers** can anticipate the organizational challenges that accompany growth and proactively build the systems, processes, and team structures needed for the next stage.
- **CTOs and VPs of Engineering** can use the framework to have productive conversations with CEOs and boards about the leadership investments required to sustain growth.
- **Founders** can use the book as a self-assessment tool, honestly evaluating whether they are evolving their leadership style in pace with their company's growth.
