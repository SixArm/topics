  <p>By charging a commission or transaction fee on each sale made through the platform</p>
  <p>The marketplace business model connects buyers and sellers on a single platform, and the operator generates revenue by charging a commission (percentage of sale price) or transaction fee (flat fee per transaction) on each sale. This is the defining revenue mechanism that distinguishes marketplaces from other business models like direct retail or subscription services.</p>
