  <p>Relying too heavily on numerical data while ignoring context, qualitative insights, and real-world outcomes</p>
  <p>The quantitative fallacy occurs when businesses mistakenly believe that data alone tells the whole story. This leads to decisions based on incomplete information—such as optimizing for metrics like click counts or cost reduction without considering quality, customer satisfaction, or employee morale. Effective decision-making requires balancing quantitative data with qualitative feedback, expert opinions, and contextual understanding.</p>
