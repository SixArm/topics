  <p>Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team</p>
  <p>Scrum defines three specific roles: the Product Owner who defines and prioritizes product features and maintains the product backlog; the Scrum Master who ensures Scrum is properly implemented and helps the team overcome obstacles; and the Development Team who designs, builds, and tests the product. These roles work together in self-organizing, cross-functional teams to deliver value in short cycles called sprints.</p>
