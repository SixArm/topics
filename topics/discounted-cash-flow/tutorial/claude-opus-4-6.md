# Discounted cash flow (DCF)

Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is a financial modeling technique used to determine the intrinsic value of a company, project, or investment based on its expected future cash flows. For technology professionals, DCF is essential when evaluating startup valuations, SaaS company acquisitions, infrastructure investments, and build-versus-buy decisions. The core idea is straightforward: a dollar received in the future is worth less than a dollar received today, so future cash flows must be "discounted" back to the present to reflect their true value. DCF is widely used in venture capital, private equity, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate capital budgeting.

## How DCF works

DCF analysis involves projecting the free cash flows a business or investment is expected to generate over a forecast period, typically five to ten years. Each projected cash flow is then discounted back to its present value using a discount rate, which reflects the cost of capital and the risk associated with those future cash flows. The sum of all discounted cash flows, plus a terminal value representing cash flows beyond the forecast period, produces the enterprise value of the investment. Comparing this intrinsic value to the current price or cost determines whether the investment is attractive.

The fundamental formula is:

**PV = CF / (1 + r)^n**

Where PV is the present value, CF is the cash flow in a given period, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods into the future.

## Key components

A DCF model has several essential building blocks that must each be estimated carefully:

- **Free cash flow (FCF):** The cash generated by operations after subtracting capital expenditures. For a SaaS company, this includes recurring subscription revenue minus hosting costs, development expenses, sales costs, and infrastructure capex.
- **Forecast period:** The number of years over which explicit cash flow projections are made, usually five to ten years depending on the maturity and predictability of the business.
- **Discount rate:** The rate of return required by investors to compensate for risk and the time value of money. This is often derived from the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or a target hurdle rate.
- **Terminal value:** The value of all cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period, calculated using either a perpetuity growth model or an exit multiple approach.
- **Net present value (NPV):** The sum of all discounted future cash flows minus the initial investment. A positive NPV indicates expected profit; a negative NPV indicates expected loss.

## Steps in a DCF analysis

1. **Forecast revenue and expenses.** Project revenues, operating expenses, capital expenditures, working capital changes, and taxes over the forecast period. For technology companies, this means modeling subscription growth rates, customer churn, expansion revenue, and infrastructure scaling costs.
2. **Calculate free cash flow.** Derive the free cash flow for each year by taking operating income, adjusting for taxes, adding back non-cash charges like depreciation, and subtracting capital expenditures and changes in working capital.
3. **Determine the discount rate.** Estimate the WACC or appropriate hurdle rate based on the company's capital structure, cost of equity, cost of debt, and risk profile.
4. **Discount the cash flows.** Apply the discount rate to each year's projected free cash flow to calculate its present value.
5. **Estimate terminal value.** Calculate the value of the business beyond the forecast period using a perpetuity growth model (Gordon Growth Model) or an exit multiple method.
6. **Sum all present values.** Add the discounted free cash flows and the discounted terminal value to arrive at the enterprise value.
7. **Subtract debt and add cash.** Adjust for net debt to arrive at equity value, then divide by shares outstanding to get intrinsic value per share if applicable.

## Discount rate considerations

The discount rate is the single most influential assumption in a DCF model. Small changes in the discount rate produce large changes in the calculated value.

| Factor | Effect on discount rate | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Higher business risk | Increases the rate | Early-stage startup with no revenue |
| Lower business risk | Decreases the rate | Mature enterprise software company |
| Higher interest rates | Increases cost of debt component | Rising central bank rates |
| Strong competitive moat | Decreases the rate | Platform with high switching costs |
| Volatile cash flows | Increases the rate | Project-based consulting firm |
| Predictable recurring revenue | Decreases the rate | SaaS company with 95% net retention |

For technology companies, discount rates typically range from 8% to 15% for mature businesses, and 20% to 40% or higher for early-stage ventures where uncertainty is substantial.

## Terminal value methods

Because the explicit forecast period only covers a finite number of years, the terminal value often represents 60% to 80% of the total enterprise value. Two common approaches are used:

| Method | Formula | Best used when |
|---|---|---|
| Perpetuity growth model | TV = FCF * (1 + g) / (r - g) | The business is expected to grow at a stable, modest rate indefinitely |
| Exit multiple method | TV = FCF * multiple | Comparable company multiples are readily available |

In the perpetuity growth model, g is the long-term growth rate (typically 2% to 4%, approximating GDP or inflation growth), r is the discount rate, and FCF is the final year's free cash flow. The exit multiple method applies an industry-standard valuation multiple (such as EV/EBITDA) to the final year's financial metric.

## DCF for technology companies

Technology companies present unique challenges for DCF analysis:

- **High growth rates.** Many technology companies grow revenue at 30% to 100% annually in early stages, making long-term projections highly uncertain.
- **Negative near-term cash flows.** SaaS companies and platforms often invest heavily upfront in customer acquisition and product development, generating negative free cash flow for years before reaching profitability.
- **Unit economics matter.** Metrics like customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), monthly recurring revenue (MRR), and net revenue retention provide the foundation for realistic cash flow projections.
- **Winner-take-most dynamics.** Platform and network effects can create exponential value, but also mean that competitive outcomes are binary, increasing model uncertainty.
- **Rapid obsolescence risk.** Technology shifts can render products or entire business models obsolete, which must be reflected in higher discount rates or scenario analysis.

When applying DCF to a technology investment, it is critical to model multiple scenarios (base case, upside, and downside) and to stress-test assumptions around growth rate, churn, margin expansion, and competitive dynamics.

## Strengths and limitations

**Strengths:**

- Provides an intrinsic, fundamental valuation independent of market sentiment or comparable company pricing
- Forces rigorous thinking about the drivers of value: revenue growth, margins, capital intensity, and risk
- Allows scenario analysis and sensitivity testing across a range of assumptions
- Applicable to any cash-flow-generating asset, from a single project to an entire enterprise

**Limitations:**

- Highly sensitive to assumptions, particularly the discount rate and terminal value growth rate
- Requires accurate and realistic cash flow projections, which are difficult for early-stage or rapidly evolving technology companies
- The discount rate involves subjective judgment about risk, and small changes can dramatically alter the result
- Terminal value often dominates the total valuation, meaning errors in this single estimate can overshadow the entire analysis
- Does not capture optionality, strategic value, or non-financial benefits of an investment

## Comparison with other valuation methods

| Method | Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|---|
| DCF | Discounts projected future cash flows | Intrinsic, fundamental, scenario-flexible | Assumption-sensitive, complex |
| Comparable company analysis | Values based on peer multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA) | Market-based, simple, quick | Depends on finding true comparables |
| Precedent transactions | Values based on past M&A deal multiples | Reflects actual prices paid | Historical deals may not reflect current conditions |
| Book value | Values based on net asset value on the balance sheet | Objective, verifiable | Ignores intangible assets and growth potential |
| Venture capital method | Works backward from expected exit value | Suited to early-stage companies | Relies on exit assumptions and target returns |

DCF is most valuable when used alongside these other methods to triangulate a reasonable valuation range rather than relying on any single approach.

## Summary

Discounted cash flow analysis is a foundational financial technique that estimates the intrinsic value of an investment by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them to present value. For technology professionals, mastering DCF is essential for evaluating startup investments, justifying infrastructure spending, assessing acquisition targets, and making informed build-versus-buy decisions. While DCF demands careful assumptions about growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values, it provides a rigorous, transparent framework for thinking about what a business or project is truly worth. The best practice is to use DCF as one tool among several, combining it with comparable analysis and scenario modeling to reach a well-grounded valuation.
