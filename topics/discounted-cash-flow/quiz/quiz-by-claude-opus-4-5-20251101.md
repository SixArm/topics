  <p>The investment is expected to generate profit</p>
  <p>In DCF analysis, the Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the initial investment from the present value of all projected future cash flows. A positive NPV indicates that the discounted future cash flows exceed the initial cost, meaning the investment is expected to be profitable. Conversely, a negative NPV signals an expected loss. This metric is fundamental for technology professionals evaluating projects, acquisitions, or capital expenditures.</p>
