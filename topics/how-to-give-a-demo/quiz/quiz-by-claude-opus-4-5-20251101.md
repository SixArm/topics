  <p>End with a call to action that summarizes key points and states desired next steps</p>
  <p>An effective demo conclusion wraps up by summarizing the key points, reinforcing the benefits of your solution, and clearly stating the desired actions you want the audience to take. This ensures the audience leaves with a clear understanding of value and knows what to do next, whether that's scheduling a follow-up, signing up for a trial, or making a purchase decision.</p>
