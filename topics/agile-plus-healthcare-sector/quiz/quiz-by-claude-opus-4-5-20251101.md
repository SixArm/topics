  <p>They reduced time-to-market from years to months while ensuring regulatory compliance</p>
  <p>Kaiser Permanente used Scrum methodology to deliver features incrementally, enabling real-time user testing and clinical validation. This approach significantly reduced their time-to-market from years to months while still maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA. This demonstrates how agile practices can accelerate delivery without sacrificing regulatory requirements critical to healthcare.</p>
