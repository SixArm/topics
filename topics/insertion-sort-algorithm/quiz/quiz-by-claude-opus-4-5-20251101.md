- [ ] O(n)
- [ ] O(n²)
- [ ] O(log n)

  <p>O(n²)</p>
  <p>Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n²) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements. This occurs because for each element, the algorithm may need to compare and shift all previously sorted elements. Despite this quadratic complexity, insertion sort performs well on small lists and lists that are already mostly sorted, making it practical for certain real-world scenarios.</p>
