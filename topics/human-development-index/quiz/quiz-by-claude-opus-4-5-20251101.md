  <p>Health, education, and standard of living</p>
  <p>The HDI was developed by the United Nations Development Programme as an alternative to purely economic measures like GDP. It measures health (via life expectancy at birth), education (via expected and mean years of schooling), and standard of living (via gross national income per capita). Each dimension is weighted equally, producing a score between 0.0 and 1.0 that provides a more comprehensive view of human development than economic indicators alone.</p>
