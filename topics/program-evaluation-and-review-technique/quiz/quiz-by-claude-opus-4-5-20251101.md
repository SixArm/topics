# Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

Question: What are the three time estimates that PERT uses for each task to calculate expected duration?

- [ ] Minimum, average, and maximum
- [ ] Best case, worst case, and expected case
- [ ] Optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic
- [ ] Fastest, slowest, and median

  <p>Optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic</p>
  <p>PERT uses three specific time estimates for each task: optimistic (the minimum time if everything goes perfectly), most likely (the expected time under normal conditions), and pessimistic (the maximum time if things go wrong). These three estimates are used to calculate the expected duration of each task and account for uncertainty and variability in project scheduling.</p>
