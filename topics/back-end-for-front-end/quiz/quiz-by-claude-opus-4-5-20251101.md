# Back-end-for-Front-end (BFF)

Question: What is the primary purpose of the Back-end-for-Front-end (BFF) architectural pattern?

- [ ] To replace microservices architecture with a monolithic back-end server
- [ ] To create a single back-end service that handles all front-end clients uniformly
- [ ] To create dedicated back-end services tailored for individual front-end applications or clients
- [ ] To eliminate the need for front-end development teams

  <p>To create dedicated back-end services tailored for individual front-end applications or clients</p>
  <p>The BFF pattern involves creating separate back-end services specifically optimized for each front-end application, rather than using a single monolithic back-end. This enables improved front-end efficiency, independent scaling, decoupled development between front-end and back-end teams, and tailored user experiences based on each client's specific needs.</p>
