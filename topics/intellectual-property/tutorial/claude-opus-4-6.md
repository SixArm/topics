# Intellectual property (IP)

Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the human mind that are recognized and protected by law. For technology professionals, IP is a foundational concept that governs how software, hardware inventions, brand assets, and proprietary know-how are owned, licensed, and enforced. Understanding IP is essential for anyone building products, contributing to open source, negotiating contracts, or launching a startup, because the decisions you make about IP directly affect competitive positioning, revenue, and legal risk.

## Types of Intellectual Property

There are several distinct categories of IP, each governed by its own body of law, offering different forms of protection with different durations and requirements.

| Type | What It Protects | Duration | Registration Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Patents | Inventions, processes, machines, compositions of matter | Typically 20 years from filing | Yes |
| Trademarks | Brand names, logos, slogans, sounds | Indefinite (with renewal) | Recommended but not required |
| Copyrights | Original works of authorship (code, text, music, art) | Life of author + 70 years (varies) | Automatic, but registration strengthens enforcement |
| Trade Secrets | Confidential business information with competitive value | Indefinite (as long as secrecy is maintained) | No |
| Industrial Design Rights | Ornamental or aesthetic aspects of a product | Typically 10-25 years (varies by jurisdiction) | Yes |

## Patents

Patents grant inventors exclusive rights to make, use, sell, or license an invention for a limited period, typically 20 years from the date of filing. In exchange, the inventor must publicly disclose the full details of the invention. This disclosure-for-exclusivity bargain is the core mechanism by which patent systems promote innovation.

For technology professionals, patents are most relevant in hardware, semiconductor design, telecommunications, and increasingly in software-related inventions. A patent application must demonstrate that the invention is novel, non-obvious, and useful. The process of obtaining a patent (called patent prosecution) is often lengthy and expensive, sometimes taking three to five years and costing tens of thousands of dollars in legal and filing fees.

Key considerations for technologists:

- **Software patents** are granted in some jurisdictions (notably the United States) but face stricter scrutiny or outright prohibition in others (such as the European Union, which generally does not allow patents on software "as such").
- **Patent trolls** (non-practicing entities) acquire patents not to build products but to extract licensing fees or settlements through litigation. This is a significant concern for startups and mid-size technology firms.
- **Defensive patent portfolios** are maintained by many large technology companies primarily to deter patent infringement lawsuits from competitors through the threat of counter-claims.
- **Prior art searches** should be conducted before filing to ensure the invention is truly novel and to avoid wasting resources on applications likely to be rejected.

## Trademarks

Trademarks protect symbols, names, logos, slogans, sounds, and other identifiers that distinguish the goods or services of one party from those of another. Unlike patents, trademarks can last indefinitely as long as they remain in active commercial use and renewals are filed.

For technology companies, trademarks are critical for brand recognition and trust. A product name, a logo, or even a distinctive UI element can be trademarked. Registration with the relevant national or regional trademark office (such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the European Union Intellectual Property Office) provides stronger legal standing, including the ability to use the registered trademark symbol and to pursue infringers in federal court.

Key considerations for technologists:

- Conduct a **trademark clearance search** before naming a product or company to avoid costly rebranding or legal disputes.
- Trademarks are jurisdiction-specific. Protection in one country does not automatically extend to others, though international frameworks like the Madrid Protocol simplify multi-country filings.
- Generic or merely descriptive terms cannot be trademarked. Distinctive, coined, or suggestive marks receive the strongest protection.

## Copyrights

Copyright automatically protects original works of authorship the moment they are fixed in a tangible medium. For technologists, this means that source code, documentation, UI designs, graphics, videos, and written content are all protected by copyright from the moment of creation, without any need for registration.

However, registering a copyright with the relevant authority (such as the U.S. Copyright Office) provides important legal advantages, including the ability to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees in infringement cases.

Key considerations for technologists:

- **Software source code** is protected by copyright as a literary work. This applies to both proprietary and open source code.
- **Open source licenses** (such as MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) are copyright licenses. They define the terms under which the copyright holder permits others to use, modify, and distribute the code. Violating the terms of an open source license is copyright infringement.
- **Work-for-hire doctrine**: In many jurisdictions, code written by an employee within the scope of employment is owned by the employer, not the individual developer. Independent contractors, however, may retain copyright unless a written agreement assigns it.
- Copyright protects the **expression** of an idea, not the idea itself. Two developers can independently write programs that accomplish the same task, and both works are separately copyrightable, provided one is not copied from the other.

## Trade Secrets

A trade secret is any confidential business information that provides a competitive advantage. Unlike patents, trade secrets require no registration and can last indefinitely, but only as long as the information remains secret. The moment a trade secret becomes publicly known, protection is lost.

Examples relevant to technology include proprietary algorithms, training datasets, customer lists, pricing strategies, internal tooling, and manufacturing processes. The most famous example is the Coca-Cola formula, but in technology, Google's search ranking algorithm and many proprietary machine learning models function as trade secrets.

To maintain trade secret protection, organizations must take reasonable steps to safeguard the information:

- Use **non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)** with employees, contractors, and partners.
- Implement **access controls** so that confidential information is available only on a need-to-know basis.
- Mark sensitive documents as confidential.
- Conduct **exit interviews** and remind departing employees of their confidentiality obligations.
- Use technical measures such as encryption, logging, and monitoring to prevent unauthorized access.

Trade secret misappropriation is actionable under laws such as the U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act (2016) and the EU Trade Secrets Directive (2016).

## Industrial Design Rights

Industrial design rights protect the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of a product, as opposed to its functional characteristics (which are the domain of patents). This includes the shape, configuration, pattern, or ornamentation of an object.

In the technology industry, industrial design rights are most commonly applied to consumer electronics, such as the distinctive shape of a smartphone, the appearance of a laptop, or the design of a wearable device. Apple, for example, has aggressively protected the design of its products through industrial design registrations.

## IP Ownership and Assignments

One of the most common sources of IP disputes in the technology industry is ambiguity over ownership. Several factors determine who owns IP:

- **Employment agreements**: Most technology companies require employees to sign agreements assigning all work-related IP to the company. Without such agreements, ownership may default to the individual creator under local law.
- **Contractor agreements**: Independent contractors typically retain ownership of their work unless a written assignment clause transfers it to the hiring party. This is a frequent source of disputes when startups engage freelance developers.
- **Joint development**: When two or more parties collaborate on an invention or creative work, ownership can become complicated. Joint development agreements should clearly specify IP ownership, licensing rights, and commercialization terms.
- **University and research institution policies**: Technology developed in academic settings may be subject to institutional IP policies or government regulations (such as the Bayh-Dole Act in the United States), which can affect commercialization rights.

## IP Licensing

Licensing is the mechanism by which IP holders grant others the right to use their IP under specified conditions. Licensing is pervasive in the technology industry.

Common licensing models include:

- **Exclusive license**: Only the licensee may use the IP, sometimes even to the exclusion of the licensor.
- **Non-exclusive license**: The licensor may grant the same rights to multiple licensees.
- **Royalty-based license**: The licensee pays ongoing fees, often as a percentage of revenue or per unit sold.
- **Cross-license**: Two parties grant each other rights to their respective IP portfolios, a common arrangement among large technology companies to avoid mutual patent litigation.
- **Open source license**: The copyright holder permits broad use, modification, and distribution under specified conditions. Different licenses impose different obligations (e.g., copyleft licenses like GPL require derivative works to be distributed under the same terms).

## IP in the Technology Industry

Several IP dynamics are particularly relevant to technology professionals:

- **Standard-essential patents (SEPs)**: Patents that cover technology required to implement an industry standard (such as Wi-Fi, LTE, or USB). Holders of SEPs are typically required to license them on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.
- **Open source compliance**: Companies that incorporate open source components into their products must comply with the terms of each component's license. Failure to do so can result in legal action and reputational damage. Tools like software composition analysis (SCA) scanners help manage this risk.
- **IP due diligence in M&A**: When acquiring or merging with another company, thorough IP due diligence is essential to verify ownership, identify encumbrances, assess the strength of the portfolio, and uncover potential infringement risks.
- **IP in employment**: Non-compete clauses, invention assignment agreements, and non-solicitation agreements are common in technology employment contracts. Their enforceability varies significantly by jurisdiction.

## IP Strategy for Startups and Technology Companies

A deliberate IP strategy is not a luxury reserved for large corporations. Startups and growing technology companies benefit from addressing IP early:

- **File provisional patents** for key inventions to establish an early priority date at relatively low cost.
- **Register trademarks** for product and company names before launch to prevent competitors from claiming them.
- **Use written agreements** for all contributors, including co-founders, employees, and contractors, that clearly assign IP ownership.
- **Choose open source licenses deliberately** when releasing code, understanding the implications of permissive versus copyleft licenses.
- **Document trade secrets** and implement reasonable security measures to preserve their legal status.
- **Monitor competitors** for potential infringement of your IP and for risks that your products may infringe theirs.

## Summary

Intellectual property is a broad legal framework that protects creations of the mind, including inventions (patents), brand identifiers (trademarks), original works of authorship (copyrights), confidential business information (trade secrets), and product designs (industrial design rights). For technology professionals, IP touches nearly every aspect of product development, from writing code and designing interfaces to naming products and negotiating partnerships. A clear understanding of IP types, ownership rules, licensing models, and enforcement mechanisms enables technologists to protect their innovations, avoid costly legal disputes, and make informed decisions about how to build, share, and commercialize their work.
