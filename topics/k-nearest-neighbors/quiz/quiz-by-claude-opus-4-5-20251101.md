# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Question: What type of learning algorithm is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classified as?

- [ ] Eager learning algorithm that builds a model during training
- [ ] Reinforcement learning algorithm that learns from rewards
- [ ] Instance-based or lazy learning algorithm
- [ ] Generative learning algorithm that models the data distribution

  <p>Instance-based or lazy learning algorithm</p>
  <p>KNN is classified as an instance-based or lazy learning algorithm because it does not build an explicit model during training. Instead, it stores all training instances and defers computation until prediction time, when it finds the k nearest neighbors to the query point and makes decisions based on their labels or values.</p>
