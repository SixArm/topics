  <p>Following an authorized person through an access control point without proper credentials</p>
  <p>A piggyback attack (also known as tailgating) is a physical security threat where an unauthorized individual gains entry to a secure area by closely following an authorized person through an access control point, such as a door or checkpoint. The attacker may deceive the authorized person into allowing access or simply force their way through. This is distinct from network-based or software-based attacks, as it specifically exploits human behavior and physical access controls.</p>
