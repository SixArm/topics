  <p>Iterative and incremental development with continuous delivery of working software</p>
  <p>Agile software development is fundamentally an iterative and incremental approach that prioritizes continuous delivery of working software in small increments. This contrasts with traditional waterfall methodologies that deliver a complete product only at the end of the development cycle. Agile embraces flexibility, customer collaboration throughout the process, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements—making continuous delivery of small, working increments a core distinguishing characteristic.</p>
