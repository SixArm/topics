# Cognitive Task Analysis

Question: What is the primary purpose of Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) in technology and design contexts?

- [ ] To measure the physical effort required to complete manual tasks
- [ ] To document only the observable behaviors during task performance
- [ ] To uncover the knowledge, decision-making, and mental strategies individuals use while performing a task
- [ ] To automate repetitive cognitive processes through machine learning

  <p>To uncover the knowledge, decision-making, and mental strategies individuals use while performing a task</p>
  <p>CTA is a research methodology specifically designed to bridge the gap between observable behaviors and underlying cognitive processes. It aims to understand the mental models, problem-solving approaches, and decision-making strategies that experts employ, which are often tacit and not immediately visible. This understanding is crucial for designing better systems, training programs, and user interfaces that align with how people actually think and work.</p>
