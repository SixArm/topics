  <p>Strengths and Weaknesses are internal; Opportunities and Threats are external</p>
  <p>In SWOT analysis, Strengths and Weaknesses are internal factors that exist within the organization (e.g., talented employees, outdated technology), while Opportunities and Threats are external factors in the environment outside the organization (e.g., emerging markets, increased competition). Understanding this distinction is critical for technology professionals because it determines whether an issue can be addressed through internal changes or requires adapting to external conditions.</p>
