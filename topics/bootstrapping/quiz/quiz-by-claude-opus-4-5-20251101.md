  <p>Using personal resources rather than external investment to fund the business</p>
  <p>Bootstrapping describes growing a startup using personal resources such as savings or credit cards, rather than relying on external investment. This approach allows founders to maintain control of their company, avoid giving up equity to outside investors, and forces a focus on revenue generation from the outset, which can lead to a sustainable and profitable business model.</p>
