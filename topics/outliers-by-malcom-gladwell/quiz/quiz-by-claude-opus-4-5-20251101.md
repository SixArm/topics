  <p>10,000 hours</p>
  <p>The "10,000 hour rule" is the central theme of Gladwell's book. He argues that successful individuals are not simply born with innate talent, but rather they have dedicated approximately 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to developing their skills. Gladwell illustrates this concept through examples like Bill Gates and the Beatles, who all put in extensive practice time before achieving their breakthrough success.</p>
