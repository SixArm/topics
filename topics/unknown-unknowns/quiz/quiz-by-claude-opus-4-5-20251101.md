  <p>Seeking diverse perspectives, questioning assumptions, and using scenario planning</p>
  <p>Since unknown unknowns are risks we don't know we don't know, they cannot be identified through conventional methods like reviewing past data or focusing on already-identified risks. Effective mitigation requires fostering humility, curiosity, and openness—gathering diverse viewpoints, challenging assumptions, conducting comprehensive risk assessments, and using scenario planning to uncover potential blind spots and anticipate unanticipated risks.</p>
