  <p>Trade secrets are protected through confidentiality rather than registration or public disclosure</p>
  <p>Unlike patents, trademarks, and copyrights, trade secrets do not require registration or public disclosure. Instead, they are protected by keeping the information confidential through security measures such as non-disclosure agreements, password-protected systems, and restricted access to sensitive information. This fundamental difference means trade secret protection can potentially last indefinitely, as long as the information remains secret.</p>
