  <p>They are paid only when the client company hires a candidate they have sourced</p>
  <p>Unlike retained search firms that receive upfront fees, contingency recruiters operate on a success-based model where they only get paid if and when a candidate they sourced is actually hired by the client company. This payment structure incentivizes quick placements but can also create pressure to prioritize speed over thorough vetting.</p>
