# Contingency recruiter

A contingency recruiter is a type of recruiting professional or agency that operates on a "no placement, no fee" basis. The recruiter is only compensated when a candidate they have sourced is successfully hired by the client company. This model shifts the financial risk away from the employer and onto the recruiter, making it one of the most widely used recruiting arrangements for mid-level and specialized technology roles. For technology professionals, understanding how contingency recruiters work is essential whether you are hiring for your team or navigating the job market yourself.

## How contingency recruiting works

The contingency recruiting process follows a straightforward lifecycle. A client company engages one or more contingency recruiters to fill an open position. The recruiter sources candidates through job boards, professional networks, LinkedIn, internal databases, and referrals. Once promising candidates are identified, the recruiter screens them for technical qualifications, cultural fit, and role alignment, then presents a shortlist to the hiring company. If the company hires one of the recruiter's candidates, the recruiter earns a fee, typically calculated as a percentage of the new hire's first-year base salary. If no hire is made, the recruiter receives nothing.

Because there is no upfront commitment from the employer, companies often engage multiple contingency recruiters simultaneously for the same role. This creates a competitive dynamic where speed and candidate quality both matter.

## Fee structure

Contingency recruiter fees vary based on the role, industry, and geographic market. The following table outlines typical fee ranges in the technology sector.

| Factor | Typical Range |
|---|---|
| Fee as percentage of first-year salary | 15% to 25% |
| Common rate for mid-level tech roles | 18% to 22% |
| Guarantee period (replacement if hire leaves) | 30 to 90 days |
| Payment trigger | Candidate's start date |
| Upfront cost to employer | None |

For a software engineer with a $150,000 base salary at a 20% fee, the recruiter would earn $30,000 upon successful placement.

## When companies use contingency recruiters

Contingency recruiting is best suited to certain hiring scenarios. Companies typically choose this model when:

- The role is mid-level or senior but not C-suite or executive leadership.
- There is a large pool of qualified candidates in the market.
- The company wants to minimize financial risk and avoid upfront commitments.
- Speed of hire is a priority, as contingency recruiters are motivated to fill roles quickly.
- The position is more transactional in nature, such as a contract-to-hire or a well-defined technical role.
- Internal recruiting capacity is insufficient to handle current hiring volume.

## Contingency recruiting versus retained search

Technology professionals frequently encounter both contingency and retained search models. Understanding the differences is critical for making the right choice.

| Dimension | Contingency Recruiter | Retained Search Firm |
|---|---|---|
| Payment model | Fee paid only upon successful hire | Upfront retainer plus completion fee |
| Typical roles | Mid-level to senior individual contributors | Executive and C-suite leadership |
| Exclusivity | Non-exclusive; multiple firms may compete | Typically exclusive engagement |
| Search depth | Faster, broader sourcing | Deep, methodical, targeted search |
| Candidate vetting | Screening and qualification checks | Comprehensive assessment and references |
| Relationship | Transactional, role-by-role | Long-term, strategic partnership |
| Risk to employer | Low financial risk | Higher upfront cost, lower placement risk |
| Typical fee range | 15% to 25% of first-year salary | 25% to 35% of first-year compensation |

## Benefits of contingency recruiting

Contingency recruiting offers several advantages for both employers and candidates in the technology sector:

- **Zero upfront cost.** Employers pay nothing until a successful hire is made, making it a low-risk option for companies of all sizes.
- **Speed.** Recruiters are financially incentivized to present qualified candidates quickly, which can shorten time-to-fill.
- **Market access.** Experienced contingency recruiters maintain deep networks of passive candidates who are not actively searching job boards.
- **Competitive sourcing.** Engaging multiple recruiters creates parallel sourcing pipelines, increasing the likelihood of finding the right candidate.
- **Flexibility.** Companies can engage or disengage contingency recruiters without contractual penalties in most cases.

## Risks and limitations

Despite its advantages, the contingency model has notable drawbacks that technology hiring managers should consider:

- **Quantity over quality.** Because payment depends on placement, some recruiters may push candidates who are adequate but not ideal, prioritizing volume over precision.
- **Shallow vetting.** The speed-driven nature of contingency work can lead to less thorough technical screening and reference checking.
- **Candidate overlap.** When multiple recruiters work the same role, the same candidate may be submitted by more than one firm, creating disputes over fee ownership.
- **Short-term focus.** Contingency recruiters may prioritize quick wins over building a deep understanding of the company's culture, technology stack, and long-term needs.
- **Limited engagement on hard-to-fill roles.** If a role is niche or difficult, contingency recruiters may deprioritize it in favor of easier placements that yield faster revenue.

## Best practices for working with contingency recruiters

Whether you are a hiring manager or a candidate, following these guidelines will improve your experience with contingency recruiters:

- **Define the role clearly.** Provide detailed job descriptions, required technical skills, compensation ranges, and team context so the recruiter can target the right candidates.
- **Limit the number of agencies.** Engaging two or three firms is more effective than flooding the market with ten. Fewer firms means better-quality submissions and fewer ownership disputes.
- **Establish submission rules.** Require recruiters to submit candidates through a tracking system and confirm that candidates have not already been sourced internally or by another agency.
- **Negotiate the guarantee period.** Ensure the contract includes a replacement guarantee of at least 60 to 90 days in case the hire does not work out.
- **Evaluate recruiter specialization.** Choose recruiters who specialize in your technology domain, whether that is cloud infrastructure, data engineering, cybersecurity, or product management.
- **Provide timely feedback.** Contingency recruiters work on tight timelines. Slow feedback loops cause top candidates to accept other offers.

## Summary

A contingency recruiter provides a pay-for-performance hiring model where the recruiter earns a fee only when a candidate is successfully placed. This approach offers low financial risk and fast turnaround, making it well suited for mid-level and senior technology roles where the candidate market is active. However, the model's speed-driven incentives can sometimes compromise candidate quality and depth of engagement. Technology professionals who understand the mechanics, benefits, and limitations of contingency recruiting are better positioned to leverage it effectively, whether they are building teams or advancing their own careers.
