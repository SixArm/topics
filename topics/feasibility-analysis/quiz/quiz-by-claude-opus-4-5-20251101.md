  <p>Technical, economic, legal, operational, environmental, and social feasibility</p>
  <p>A comprehensive feasibility analysis evaluates multiple dimensions: technical feasibility (can it be built with available technology), economic feasibility (costs vs. benefits), legal feasibility (regulatory compliance), operational feasibility (integration with existing systems), environmental feasibility (ecological impact), and social feasibility (community and societal effects). These dimensions provide a holistic view of whether a project should proceed.</p>
