# t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

Question: What is the primary focus of t-SNE compared to other dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?

- [ ] Maximizing the variance of the projected data
- [ ] Reconstructing the original high-dimensional data accurately
- [ ] Preserving local relationships and pairwise similarities between data points
- [ ] Reducing computational cost for real-time applications

  <p>Preserving local relationships and pairwise similarities between data points</p>
  <p>t-SNE is specifically designed to preserve the pairwise similarities between data points, with a focus on maintaining local relationships. Unlike PCA, which focuses on maximizing variance and preserving global structure, t-SNE excels at revealing clusters and local patterns in the data by ensuring that points that are similar in high-dimensional space remain close together in the lower-dimensional representation.</p>
