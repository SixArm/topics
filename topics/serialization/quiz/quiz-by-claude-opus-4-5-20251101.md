  <p>Converting data objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted</p>
  <p>Serialization is the process of converting a data object into a stream of bytes that can be written to a file, stored in a database, or sent across a network. This enables data transfer between different systems, programming languages, or platforms, and allows objects to be deserialized back into their original form when needed.</p>
