  <p>Adapting communication strategies based on whether cultures are high-context or low-context</p>
  <p>Effective cross-cultural communication requires understanding that different cultures have distinct communication styles—some are direct and low-context (meaning information is explicit), while others are indirect and high-context (meaning context, relationships, and nonverbal cues carry significant meaning). Technology professionals working with global teams must recognize these differences and adapt their approach accordingly, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all method that may lead to misunderstandings.</p>
