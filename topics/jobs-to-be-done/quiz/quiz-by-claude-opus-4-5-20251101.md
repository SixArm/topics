  <p>Customers "hire" products or services to accomplish specific goals or outcomes they want to achieve</p>
  <p>The JTBD framework emphasizes that customers don't simply buy products based on features—they "hire" them to get a job done. The "job" refers to the progress or outcome customers are trying to make in a particular circumstance. This outcome-oriented thinking shifts focus from product attributes to understanding the underlying motivations and goals driving customer decisions, enabling organizations to design solutions that align more effectively with customer needs.</p>
