# Jobs to be Done (JTBD)

Jobs to be Done (JTBD) is a strategic framework for understanding why customers make the choices they do. Rather than segmenting users by demographics or analyzing feature preferences, JTBD reframes the question: what progress is the customer trying to make in a given circumstance? The theory holds that people do not buy products -- they "hire" them to accomplish a specific job. This shift in perspective has profound implications for product development, marketing, and competitive strategy, particularly in the technology sector where feature creep and misaligned roadmaps are persistent risks.

## Origins and Core Theory

JTBD emerged from the work of Clayton Christensen at Harvard Business School, building on earlier insights from Theodore Levitt, who famously observed that customers do not want a quarter-inch drill -- they want a quarter-inch hole. Christensen, along with collaborators such as Anthony Ulwick and Bob Moesta, formalized the idea into a repeatable framework during the late 1990s and 2000s.

The central premise is that every product or service is hired to fulfill a job that arises in a specific context. A "job" is not a task in isolation; it is the full constellation of functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the progress a person is trying to make. When a product fulfills that job well, the customer retains it. When it fails, the customer "fires" it and looks for an alternative -- which may come from an entirely different product category.

## Functional, Emotional, and Social Dimensions

A job is rarely one-dimensional. Technology professionals who apply JTBD must account for three interrelated dimensions of every job:

| Dimension | Definition | Example (Project Management Tool) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Functional | The practical task or outcome the customer needs to achieve | Track task dependencies and deadlines across a distributed team |
| Emotional | How the customer wants to feel during and after the job | Feel confident that nothing is falling through the cracks |
| Social | How the customer wants to be perceived by others | Appear organized and in control during stakeholder reviews |

A product that nails the functional dimension but ignores the emotional and social dimensions will lose to a competitor that addresses all three. This is why spreadsheets, despite being functionally adequate for project tracking, are routinely displaced by purpose-built tools that also deliver confidence and professional credibility.

## The JTBD Interview Method

The primary research technique in JTBD is the "switch interview," a structured conversation that explores the timeline of a customer's decision to adopt or abandon a product. The interview focuses on four forces that act on every switching decision:

- **Push of the current situation**: The dissatisfaction or frustration with the existing solution that motivates a search for something new.
- **Pull of the new solution**: The attraction of a new product's promise -- the imagined better outcome.
- **Anxiety of the new solution**: The uncertainty, learning curve, or risk associated with adopting something unfamiliar.
- **Habit of the present**: The inertia and comfort of the status quo, even when it is suboptimal.

A product wins adoption when the combined push and pull forces outweigh the combined anxiety and habit forces. For technology professionals, this model explains why technically superior solutions frequently fail in the market: they underestimate user anxiety and the gravitational pull of existing habits.

## JTBD Compared to Other Frameworks

JTBD does not replace all other product strategy tools, but it occupies a distinct position. Understanding where it overlaps and diverges from adjacent frameworks helps teams apply it correctly.

| Framework | Primary Focus | Relationship to JTBD |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Personas | Who the user is (demographics, behaviors, archetypes) | JTBD shifts focus from who to why; different personas may share the same job |
| User Stories | What the user wants to do within a system | User stories describe features; JTBD describes the higher-order motivation behind the feature |
| Design Thinking | Empathy-driven ideation and prototyping | JTBD provides a structured input to the empathy phase of design thinking |
| Lean Startup | Build-measure-learn experimentation | JTBD helps identify what to build and measure in the first place |
| Value Proposition Canvas | Mapping pains, gains, and customer jobs | Directly incorporates JTBD as a foundational element |

## Applying JTBD in Technology Product Development

For technology professionals -- product managers, engineers, designers, and technical leaders -- JTBD offers a practical lens for several critical activities:

- **Prioritizing the roadmap**: Features that address the core job outrank features that are technically interesting but tangential. JTBD provides a principled basis for saying no.
- **Identifying non-obvious competitors**: A JTBD lens reveals that your product competes not just with similar tools, but with any solution the customer might hire for the same job. A video conferencing tool competes with airline tickets. A documentation platform competes with tribal knowledge shared over chat.
- **Reducing churn**: When customers leave, JTBD analysis uncovers whether the product failed on the functional, emotional, or social dimension -- or whether the forces of anxiety and habit prevented full adoption in the first place.
- **Framing marketing and positioning**: Messaging that speaks to the job ("ship code with confidence") resonates more deeply than messaging that lists capabilities ("continuous integration with 200 integrations").
- **Guiding API and platform design**: For technology platforms, understanding the developer's job helps design APIs, SDKs, and documentation that align with the progress developers are trying to make, rather than merely exposing internal system capabilities.

## Outcome-Driven Innovation

Anthony Ulwick's Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI) methodology is the most formalized quantitative application of JTBD. ODI breaks a job into discrete outcome statements -- measurable criteria the customer uses to judge success. Each outcome is scored on two axes: importance and current satisfaction. Outcomes that are highly important but poorly satisfied represent the strongest opportunities for innovation.

The ODI process follows a structured sequence:

- Define the job at the right level of abstraction (not too broad, not too narrow).
- Map the full job process from beginning to end.
- Identify 50 to 150 desired outcome statements from customer research.
- Quantitatively survey a broader population to score importance and satisfaction.
- Calculate opportunity scores to prioritize where to invest.

This quantitative rigor makes ODI particularly appealing to technology organizations that want data-driven product decisions rather than intuition-based roadmaps.

## Common Pitfalls

Teams adopting JTBD frequently encounter several traps:

- **Defining the job too narrowly**: "Send a Slack message" is not a job. "Coordinate with a distributed team to resolve a production incident quickly" is a job. The job should be solution-agnostic and describe the desired progress.
- **Confusing jobs with tasks**: Tasks are the steps within a job. The job is the overarching outcome. Conflating them leads to incremental feature additions rather than meaningful innovation.
- **Ignoring context**: The same person may have different jobs in different circumstances. A developer debugging alone at 2 AM has a different job than the same developer presenting a postmortem to leadership the next morning.
- **Treating JTBD as a one-time exercise**: Jobs evolve as technology and market conditions change. Continuous research is essential.

Technology professionals exploring JTBD should also study product-market fit and how to validate whether a product genuinely fulfills a market job. Design thinking and empathy mapping provide complementary techniques for uncovering latent needs. The Lean Startup methodology offers a framework for experimentally testing job hypotheses. Value proposition design, particularly the Value Proposition Canvas by Strategyzer, directly builds on JTBD principles. Understanding customer discovery and customer experience management deepens the ability to apply JTBD insights across the full product lifecycle.

## Summary

Jobs to be Done is a framework that reorients product strategy around the progress customers are trying to make rather than the features a product offers. By decomposing customer motivations into functional, emotional, and social dimensions, analyzing the forces that drive and resist switching behavior, and quantifying opportunity through methods like Outcome-Driven Innovation, technology professionals gain a durable foundation for building products that customers genuinely need. JTBD does not replace technical judgment or engineering craft -- it ensures that craft is directed at problems worth solving.
