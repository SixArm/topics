  <p>Make it work, make it right, make it fast</p>
  <p>This famous principle from Kent Beck encapsulates his iterative approach to development. He believes in getting something functional first ("make it work"), then refining it through successive improvements ("make it right"), and only then optimizing for performance ("make it fast"). This approach avoids premature optimization and perfectionism by focusing on delivering working software incrementally rather than attempting perfection from the start.</p>
