# Chain of Thought

Question: What is the primary purpose of "chain of thought" in artificial intelligence systems?

- [ ] To optimize the storage of training data in memory banks
- [ ] To describe the sequence of reasoning steps the AI uses to arrive at a decision or generate a response
- [ ] To encrypt communication between AI models in distributed systems
- [ ] To measure the computational speed of neural network layers

  <p>To describe the sequence of reasoning steps the AI uses to arrive at a decision or generate a response</p>
  <p>Chain of thought refers to the internal workings of an AI model as it processes input data through multiple stages—including embedding, computation, attention mechanisms, sequence processing, and decoding—to produce an output. Understanding this concept is essential for technology professionals working with AI systems, as it explains how models reason through problems rather than simply pattern-matching.</p>
