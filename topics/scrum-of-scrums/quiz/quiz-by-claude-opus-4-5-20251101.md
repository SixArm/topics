  <p>Integration points and dependencies between teams</p>
  <p>Scrum of Scrums meetings focus on inter-team coordination rather than detailed task-level work. Representatives discuss technical dependencies, shared resources, conflicting priorities, and integration challenges that could impact delivery timelines. This creates transparency across teams while maintaining their autonomy to manage their own work within their respective sprints.</p>
