# Scrum of Scrums: Tutorial

## Overview

Scrum of Scrums is a scaled agile framework technique designed to coordinate multiple Scrum teams working on the same product or project. As organizations grow and their products become more complex, a single Scrum team is often insufficient to handle the scope of work. Scrum of Scrums provides a lightweight coordination mechanism that allows multiple teams to align their efforts, manage cross-team dependencies, and resolve shared impediments -- all while preserving each team's autonomy and the collaborative, iterative nature of Scrum.

For agile change technology professionals, Scrum of Scrums is an essential scaling tool. It addresses one of the most common challenges in enterprise agile adoption: how to maintain agility and communication across multiple teams without introducing heavy bureaucratic processes.

## Key Concepts

### Team Representatives

In a Scrum of Scrums implementation, each individual Scrum team selects a representative to participate in the coordination meeting. This is typically the Scrum Master, but it can also be a technical lead or any team member with sufficient knowledge of the team's progress, plans, and impediments. The representative serves as a communication bridge between their team and the broader group.

### The Scrum of Scrums Meeting

The coordination meeting follows a format similar to the Daily Scrum standup. Each representative shares three key pieces of information:

- What their team has accomplished since the last meeting.
- What their team plans to work on next.
- Any blockers or impediments that might affect other teams.

These meetings occur regularly -- often daily or several times per week -- and are kept focused and time-boxed to ensure they remain efficient.

### Focus on Integration and Dependencies

The Scrum of Scrums meeting is not intended for detailed task-level coordination within individual teams. Instead, it focuses on the intersections between teams: technical dependencies, shared resources, conflicting priorities, integration challenges, and anything that could impact cross-team delivery timelines. This higher-level focus creates transparency across teams while respecting each team's ability to manage its own internal work.

### Maintaining Team Autonomy

A fundamental principle of Scrum of Scrums is that individual teams retain full ownership of their sprint work. The coordination meeting does not dictate how teams should work; it ensures that teams are aware of each other's progress and can proactively address conflicts and dependencies.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

### Step 1: Identify the Teams and Their Interdependencies

Before implementing Scrum of Scrums, map out all the teams working on the product or project. Identify the key dependencies between teams: shared codebases, shared services, integration points, shared resources, and overlapping requirements. Understanding these interdependencies will help shape the focus and frequency of the coordination meetings.

### Step 2: Select Team Representatives

Each team should designate a representative who will attend the Scrum of Scrums meeting. Choose someone who has a comprehensive understanding of the team's current work, upcoming plans, and any impediments. This person should also have the communication skills to effectively convey information and advocate for their team's needs.

### Step 3: Establish Meeting Cadence and Format

Determine how often the Scrum of Scrums meeting will occur. Daily meetings work well for teams with tight dependencies, while two or three times per week may suffice for teams with fewer integration points. Define a clear agenda structure: each representative reports on accomplishments, upcoming work, and blockers, with a specific focus on cross-team impacts.

### Step 4: Designate a Facilitator

Appoint a facilitator for the Scrum of Scrums meeting. This could be a senior Scrum Master, a Release Train Engineer, or a dedicated coordinator. The facilitator keeps the meeting on track, ensures all teams are heard, and helps escalate unresolved impediments to appropriate decision-makers.

### Step 5: Establish Shared Tooling and Visibility

Use shared project management tools (such as Jira, Azure DevOps, or similar platforms) to provide visibility across teams. Create shared dashboards that show cross-team progress, dependency status, and integration milestones. This tooling supports the information exchanged in Scrum of Scrums meetings with persistent, accessible data.

### Step 6: Align on a Common Definition of Done

Ensure all teams share a common Definition of Done, particularly for work that crosses team boundaries. This prevents integration issues caused by inconsistent quality standards and ensures that completed work from all teams can be combined into a cohesive product increment.

### Step 7: Conduct Cross-Team Retrospectives

In addition to individual team retrospectives, hold periodic cross-team retrospectives to examine how well the Scrum of Scrums process is working. Identify communication gaps, recurring dependency conflicts, and process improvements that can enhance inter-team coordination.

### Step 8: Evolve the Approach

As your organization matures, assess whether Scrum of Scrums continues to meet your scaling needs. For very large programs, you may need to layer additional coordination mechanisms (such as a Scrum of Scrums of Scrums) or consider adopting a more comprehensive scaling framework like LeSS or SAFe. Continuously refine the process based on retrospective feedback and organizational growth.

## Key Takeaway

Scrum of Scrums provides a pragmatic, low-overhead mechanism for coordinating multiple agile teams without sacrificing the autonomy and agility that makes Scrum effective. For agile change professionals leading scaled transformations, it serves as a foundational coordination technique that is easy to implement and easy to evolve. Success depends on clear communication protocols, well-chosen representatives, disciplined meeting facilitation, and a commitment to addressing cross-team dependencies proactively rather than reactively. When implemented thoughtfully, Scrum of Scrums enables organizations to scale agile practices while maintaining the collaborative spirit and iterative nature that drives team performance.
