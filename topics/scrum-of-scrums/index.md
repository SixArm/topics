# Scrum of Scrums

Scrum of Scrums is a scaled agile framework technique designed to coordinate multiple Scrum teams working on the same product or project. This approach enables organizations to maintain the benefits of Scrum while managing larger, more complex initiatives that require coordination across several teams. The framework addresses the challenge of scaling agile practices beyond single teams without losing the collaborative spirit and iterative nature that makes Scrum effective.

In a Scrum of Scrums implementation, each individual Scrum team selects a representative, typically the Scrum Master or a designated team member, to participate in a higher-level coordination meeting. These representatives meet regularly, often daily or several times per week, to discuss progress, identify dependencies, and resolve inter-team impediments. The meeting follows a structure similar to daily standups, with each representative sharing what their team accomplished, what they plan to work on next, and any blockers that might affect other teams.

The primary focus is on integration points and dependencies between teams rather than detailed task-level coordination. Representatives discuss technical dependencies, shared resources, conflicting priorities, and integration challenges that could impact delivery timelines. This creates transparency across teams while maintaining their autonomy to manage their own work within their respective sprints.

Successful Scrum of Scrums implementation requires clear communication protocols, well-defined interfaces between team responsibilities, and strong facilitation to keep meetings focused and productive. Organizations often complement this approach with shared tooling, common definition of done criteria, and regular cross-team retrospectives. While not perfect for every scaling scenario, Scrum of Scrums provides a lightweight mechanism for coordinating multiple agile teams without introducing excessive overhead or bureaucratic processes that could slow down delivery.
