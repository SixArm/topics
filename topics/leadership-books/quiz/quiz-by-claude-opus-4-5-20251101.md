  <p>Autonomy, mastery, and purpose</p>
  <p>In "Drive," Daniel Pink challenges traditional motivation theories and argues that people are intrinsically motivated by autonomy (the desire to direct our own lives), mastery (the urge to get better at something that matters), and purpose (the yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves). This framework is particularly relevant for technology professionals, as it explains why developers and engineers often thrive in environments that offer creative freedom, opportunities for skill growth, and meaningful work.</p>
