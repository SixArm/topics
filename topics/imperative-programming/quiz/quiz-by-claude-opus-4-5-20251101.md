# Imperative programming

Question: What is the fundamental characteristic that defines imperative programming as a paradigm?

- [ ] Programs are designed around mathematical functions that avoid side effects
- [ ] Computation is defined as a series of statements that modify program state
- [ ] Programs are structured as queries that describe what results are needed
- [ ] Execution is driven by reacting to changes in data streams

  <p>Computation is defined as a series of statements that modify program state</p>
  <p>Imperative programming focuses on "how" a program works by specifying step-by-step instructions that change the program's state. The programmer defines the order of execution, operations, and data structures, using variables, loops, and conditional statements to control flow. This distinguishes it from declarative paradigms that focus on "what" result is desired rather than the specific steps to achieve it.</p>
