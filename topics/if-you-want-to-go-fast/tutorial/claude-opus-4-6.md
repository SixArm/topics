# If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together

"If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together" is a widely cited proverb that captures a fundamental tension in professional and organizational life: the tradeoff between individual speed and collective endurance. Often attributed to an African proverb, its origins are debated, but its message resonates deeply across technology, business, and leadership. For technology professionals, this saying encapsulates a decision that arises daily — whether to move quickly with a solo effort or invest in alignment and collaboration for outcomes that last.

## Origins and Context

The proverb gained widespread popularity in business and leadership circles during the early 2000s, frequently appearing in keynotes, management books, and startup culture discussions. While its exact provenance is uncertain, it has been attributed to various African oral traditions. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore both popularized the phrase in political and environmental contexts.

Regardless of its origins, the saying endures because it articulates a real strategic choice. In technology work — where both speed-to-market and long-term system sustainability matter — this tension is not abstract. It plays out in architecture decisions, team formation, project planning, and organizational design every day.

## Going Fast Alone

Working independently offers clear advantages in specific situations. A solo contributor can make decisions without waiting for consensus, pivot instantly when requirements change, and eliminate the overhead of communication and coordination.

Key characteristics of the "go fast alone" approach include:

- **Rapid prototyping**: A single developer can build a proof of concept faster than a team can finish its first planning meeting.
- **Reduced coordination costs**: No standups, no merge conflicts, no design-by-committee. Decisions happen at the speed of thought.
- **Deep ownership**: One person holds the full mental model of the system, leading to coherent and internally consistent work.
- **Agility under pressure**: In crisis situations — production outages, urgent security patches, time-sensitive demos — a skilled individual can act faster than any group.

However, this mode carries risks. A single contributor creates a single point of failure. Knowledge stays siloed. Code written in isolation may lack the scrutiny that prevents technical debt. The individual may move fast initially but hit a ceiling when the work outgrows one person's capacity.

## Going Far Together

Collaboration scales what individuals cannot. Complex systems, ambitious product roadmaps, and sustained organizational growth all require more than one person's effort and perspective.

Key characteristics of the "go far together" approach include:

- **Diverse perspectives**: Teams catch blind spots, challenge assumptions, and generate ideas that no individual would reach alone.
- **Shared knowledge**: Documentation, code reviews, and pair programming distribute understanding across the group, reducing bus-factor risk.
- **Resilience**: When one team member is unavailable, others can continue the work. The project does not stall because of a single absence.
- **Compounding capability**: Over time, a well-functioning team develops shared practices, institutional memory, and increasing velocity — a trajectory that solo work cannot sustain.

The cost is real: alignment takes time, communication introduces overhead, and consensus can slow early progress. But the investment pays dividends when the goal is durability, scale, or navigating complexity.

## Comparing the Two Approaches

| Dimension | Going Fast Alone | Going Far Together |
|---|---|---|
| Decision speed | Immediate; no coordination needed | Slower; requires discussion and alignment |
| Scalability | Limited by individual capacity | Scales with team size and structure |
| Knowledge distribution | Concentrated in one person | Shared across the group |
| Risk profile | High bus-factor risk | Distributed risk |
| Innovation style | Deep individual insight | Cross-pollination of ideas |
| Communication overhead | Minimal | Significant but manageable |
| Best suited for | Prototypes, spikes, emergencies | Products, platforms, long-term systems |
| Typical failure mode | Burnout, knowledge silos, technical debt | Analysis paralysis, groupthink, slow starts |

## When to Choose Each Approach

The proverb is not a prescription for one mode over the other. It is a framework for making deliberate choices based on context. Technology professionals encounter both situations regularly.

**Choose to go fast alone when:**

- You are exploring an unproven idea and need rapid feedback.
- The scope is small and well-defined, with minimal downstream dependencies.
- A crisis demands immediate action from someone with the right expertise.
- The work is a spike or throwaway prototype that will not enter production.

**Choose to go far together when:**

- The system will be maintained and evolved over months or years.
- The problem domain is complex enough to benefit from multiple perspectives.
- The outcome affects multiple stakeholders, teams, or users.
- Sustainability, reliability, and institutional knowledge matter more than initial velocity.

In practice, many successful technology organizations blend both modes. A solo contributor spikes a solution, then brings the team in to refine, review, and productionize it. The fast start gives direction; the collective effort gives durability.

## Applying the Proverb in Technology Organizations

This principle manifests in several concrete practices within technology teams:

- **Architecture decisions**: A lone architect can sketch a system quickly, but architecture decision records (ADRs) reviewed by the team produce designs that survive contact with reality.
- **Open source development**: Many successful open source projects began as one person's side project, then grew through community collaboration into tools used by millions.
- **Startup evolution**: Founders often start by doing everything themselves. As the company grows, the transition from solo speed to team-based execution is one of the hardest and most important shifts a founder makes.
- **Incident response**: The initial responder acts fast and alone to contain the blast radius. The post-incident review is a team effort that prevents recurrence.
- **Technical debt management**: Quick solo fixes accumulate debt; systematic team-driven refactoring pays it down.

The most effective technology leaders recognize that "fast" and "far" are not opposites but phases. They create environments where individuals can move quickly when appropriate, and where teams can sustain progress when endurance matters.

## Common Pitfalls

Misapplying either side of the proverb leads to predictable failures:

- **Romanticizing solo work**: Treating collaboration as overhead rather than investment leads to fragile systems, knowledge silos, and burnout among top contributors.
- **Forcing collaboration prematurely**: Assembling a large team before the problem is understood wastes time and creates confusion. Not every task benefits from a committee.
- **Ignoring the transition**: Many projects fail in the handoff between the solo exploration phase and the team execution phase. Planning for this transition explicitly — through documentation, knowledge transfer sessions, and incremental onboarding — is essential.
- **Confusing speed with progress**: Moving fast in the wrong direction is not an advantage. Teams provide the course correction that solo contributors often lack.

## Summary

The proverb "if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together" offers technology professionals a practical lens for deciding when to work independently and when to invest in collaboration. Speed and reach are both valuable, and the best outcomes emerge from knowing which one the current situation demands. Solo work excels in exploration, urgency, and small-scope tasks; teamwork excels in building durable systems, navigating complexity, and sustaining long-term progress. The discipline lies not in choosing one mode permanently, but in switching between them deliberately and managing the transitions well.
