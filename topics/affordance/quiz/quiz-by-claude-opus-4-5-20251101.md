  <p>The perceived qualities of an object that suggest how it can be interacted with</p>
  <p>Affordance refers to the relationship between an object and its potential actions or uses. It describes qualities or attributes that convey how something can or should be interacted with—such as a raised button suggesting it can be pressed, or a round doorknob suggesting it can be grasped and turned. Affordances help bridge the gap between user goals and the actions needed to achieve them by providing visual or sensory cues.</p>
