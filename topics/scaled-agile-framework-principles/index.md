# Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principles

Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is based on ten immutable, underlying Lean-Agile
principles. These tenets and economic concepts inspire and inform the roles and
practices of SAFe.

1. Take an economic view.

2. Apply systems thinking.

3. Assume variability; preserve options.

4. Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles.

5. Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems.

6. Make value flow without interruptions.

7. Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning.

8. Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers.

9. Decentralize decision-making.

10. Organize around value.
