  <p>Milestones should be based on objective evaluation of working systems</p>
  <p>SAFe Principle 5 states "Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems." This principle emphasizes that real progress should be measured by demonstrating actual working software or systems rather than relying on documents, plans, or theoretical progress. This approach reduces risk by ensuring that milestones reflect genuine, verified capability rather than assumptions about what has been accomplished.</p>
