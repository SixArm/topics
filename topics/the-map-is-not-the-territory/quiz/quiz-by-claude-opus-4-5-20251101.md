# The map is not the territory

Question: What is the core meaning of the phrase "the map is not the territory" as it applies to technology work?

- [ ] Physical maps should never be used for navigation in software development
- [ ] Our mental models and representations of systems are simplifications that cannot fully capture the complexity of the actual systems
- [ ] Territory-based naming conventions are discouraged in codebases
- [ ] Documentation must always include geographical references

  <p>Our mental models and representations of systems are simplifications that cannot fully capture the complexity of the actual systems</p>
  <p>This concept, coined by philosopher Alfred Korzybski, reminds technology professionals that our abstractions—whether architecture diagrams, data models, documentation, or mental understanding—are inherently limited simplifications of the actual systems they represent. Recognizing this helps engineers approach problems with openness, avoid over-reliance on outdated assumptions, and remain willing to update their understanding when reality differs from their models.</p>
