  <p>To ensure understanding by summarizing what the speaker has said</p>
  <p>Reflecting involves summarizing or paraphrasing the speaker's main points using statements like "So, if I understand correctly, you're saying…" This technique confirms that you've accurately understood the message, reduces miscommunication, and shows the speaker that you're genuinely engaged.
