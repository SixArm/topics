# Agile and UI/UX design

Question: What is the primary advantage of integrating UI/UX design into agile development processes?

- [ ] It allows designers to work independently from development teams until the final stages
- [ ] It eliminates the need for user testing since designs are iteratively refined
- [ ] It enables teams to validate design decisions early through rapid prototyping and user feedback
- [ ] It ensures all design work is completed before any development begins

  <p>It enables teams to validate design decisions early through rapid prototyping and user feedback</p>
  <p>The iterative nature of agile allows UI/UX designers to create rapid prototypes, conduct user testing, and refine designs based on real user feedback and technical constraints. This approach reduces the risk of building features that don't meet user needs by validating design decisions early and often, rather than waiting until the end of the development cycle.</p>
