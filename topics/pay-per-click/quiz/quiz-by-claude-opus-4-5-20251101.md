  <p>Advertisers pay each time a user clicks on their ad</p>
  <p>PPC advertising is defined by its payment structure where advertisers pay a fee each time a user clicks on one of their ads, rather than paying for impressions or views. This model allows businesses to pay only for actual engagement with their ads, making it more cost-efficient and enabling precise tracking of ad performance and return on investment.</p>
