# AI processor

Question: What is the primary architectural advantage that allows AI processors to accelerate neural network computations more efficiently than general-purpose processors?

- [ ] Exclusive use of 64-bit double precision arithmetic
- [ ] Single-threaded sequential instruction execution
- [ ] Parallel processing with multiple simultaneous processing units
- [ ] Reliance on external memory for all data storage

  <p>Parallel processing with multiple simultaneous processing units</p>
  <p>AI processors are specifically designed with multiple processing units that can perform simultaneous computations, enabling parallel processing of data. This architecture is critical for deep learning workloads, which involve complex matrix multiplications and other operations that can be divided across many processing units at once. This parallel approach dramatically increases throughput compared to general-purpose CPUs that rely more heavily on sequential processing.</p>
