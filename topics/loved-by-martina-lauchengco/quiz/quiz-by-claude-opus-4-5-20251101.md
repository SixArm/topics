  <p>Move from product-driven marketing to creating deep emotional connections with users</p>
  <p>Lauchengco's central thesis is that tech companies must shift away from traditional, product-driven marketing and instead focus on a customer-centric approach that creates emotional connections. This involves understanding "product-love"—the deep emotional attachment successful products create with users—and building long-term relationships rather than simply pursuing short-term sales goals. This fundamental shift enables organic growth, advocacy, and deeper product adoption.</p>
