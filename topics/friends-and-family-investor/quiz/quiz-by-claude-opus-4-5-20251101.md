  <p>They invest based on a personal relationship with the entrepreneur</p>
  <p>Friends and family investors are distinguished from other investor types primarily by their relationship-based motivation. Unlike angel investors or venture capitalists who evaluate opportunities based on business metrics and potential returns, friends and family investors provide capital because of their personal connection with the entrepreneur, typically during the early stages when other funding sources may be unavailable.</p>
