# Gaussian kernel

Question: What determines the width of a Gaussian kernel and influences the level of smoothing applied?

- [ ] The distance from the center (x)
- [ ] The number of dimensions in the data
- [ ] The standard deviation (σ)
- [ ] The exponential function coefficient

  <p>The standard deviation (σ)</p>
  <p>The standard deviation (σ or sigma) is the crucial parameter that controls the width of the Gaussian kernel. A larger σ produces a wider kernel with more smoothing or blurring, while a smaller σ creates a narrower kernel that preserves more detail. This parameter directly affects how much weight is assigned to neighboring values and how quickly that weight decreases with distance from the center.</p>
