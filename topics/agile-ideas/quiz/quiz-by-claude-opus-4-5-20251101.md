  <p>When the project has fixed, well-defined requirements with regulatory compliance needs and minimal expected changes</p>
  <p>Agile contraindications refer to situations where agile may not be the best fit. Projects with fixed, well-defined requirements, strict regulatory compliance needs, and minimal expected changes may benefit more from traditional methodologies like waterfall. Agile excels when requirements evolve, frequent delivery is valued, and stakeholder collaboration is strong—but these same strengths become less relevant when requirements are stable and documentation-heavy compliance is mandatory.</p>
