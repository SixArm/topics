# The 21st Century Cures Act

The 21st Century Cures Act, signed in 2016, is United States legislation to accelerate medical innovation, improve patient access to health data, and speed up FDA approvals, focusing on areas like biomedical research, electronic health records (EHRs), and new therapies, with key provisions including enhanced data sharing, privacy for research, and new FDA pathways for fast-tracked treatments. It aims to streamline clinical trials, support the All of Us research program, and promote interoperability of health IT, while also establishing measures to combat "information blocking" of patient data.

Key Goals & Provisions:

- Accelerate Medical Research: Provides resources and flexibility to the NIH for research, reduces administrative burdens on clinical trials, and encourages diverse participation.
- Enhance Data Sharing: Promotes data exchange standards (like APIs) for EHRs, giving patients easier access to their health information to facilitate research.
- Combat Information Blocking: Addresses practices that prevent access to electronic health information, with penalties for non-compliance.
- Streamline FDA Approvals: Creates expedited pathways (like RMAT for regenerative medicine and Breakthrough Devices) and allows for real-world evidence to speed up drug and device reviews.
- Patient-Centered Care: Incorporates patient perspectives into decision-making and supports research programs like All of Us.

Impact on Healthcare:

- For Patients: Greater access to their own health records, enabling better engagement and data sharing for research.
- For Researchers: Improved access to data and fewer administrative hurdles.
- For Health IT: Mandates for interoperability and standardized data exchange between different EHR systems.
- In essence, the Cures Act aims to bring new treatments to patients faster by modernizing research, data sharing, and regulatory processes in healthcare.
