# Lifetime Value (LTV)

Question: What is the formula for calculating customer Lifetime Value (LTV)?

- [ ] LTV = (Customer Acquisition Cost x Churn Rate x Average Customer Lifespan)
- [ ] LTV = (Average Purchase Value x Number of Purchases per Year x Average Customer Lifespan)
- [ ] LTV = (Total Revenue / Number of Customers) x Profit Margin
- [ ] LTV = (Monthly Recurring Revenue x 12) / Customer Acquisition Cost

  <p>LTV = (Average Purchase Value x Number of Purchases per Year x Average Customer Lifespan)</p>
  <p>This formula captures the three essential components of customer lifetime value: how much customers spend per transaction (average purchase value), how frequently they buy (number of purchases per year), and how long they remain customers (average customer lifespan). For example, a customer with $100 average purchase, 2 purchases per year, over 5 years would have an LTV of $1,000. Understanding this calculation helps technology professionals make data-driven decisions about customer acquisition spending and retention investments.</p>
