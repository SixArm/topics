# Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Question: What does a lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) value indicate about a regression model's predictions?

- [ ] The model is overfitting to the training data
- [ ] The predictions are farther from the true values
- [ ] The predictions are closer to the true values
- [ ] The model has more data points in the dataset

  <p>The predictions are closer to the true values</p>
  <p>MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. A lower MSE means smaller differences between predictions and ground truth, indicating the model's predictions are more accurate. Conversely, a higher MSE indicates predictions that deviate more from the actual values.</p>
