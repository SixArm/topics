# Recursion

Question: What is the primary purpose of a base case in a recursive function?

- [ ] To increase the performance of the recursive algorithm
- [ ] To allow the function to call itself with larger inputs
- [ ] To serve as a stopping condition that prevents infinite recursion
- [ ] To convert the recursive function into an iterative loop

  <p>To serve as a stopping condition that prevents infinite recursion</p>
  <p>The base case is the fundamental stopping criterion in any recursive function. It defines when the recursion should end by specifying a condition that, when met, returns a result directly without making another recursive call. Without a properly defined base case, a recursive function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.</p>
