  <p>Focus on interests instead of positions and separate people from the problem</p>
  <p>"Getting to Yes" teaches a collaborative negotiation approach where you separate people from the problem and focus on underlying interests rather than stated positions. This principled negotiation method helps both parties find mutually beneficial solutions rather than treating negotiation as a zero-sum game.</p>
