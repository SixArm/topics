# Modified Z-Score

Question: What makes the Modified Z-Score more robust for outlier detection compared to the standard Z-Score?

- [ ] It uses the mean and standard deviation, which are less affected by extreme values
- [ ] It applies a logarithmic transformation to normalize the data distribution
- [ ] It uses the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) instead of mean and standard deviation
- [ ] It calculates the distance from the mode rather than central tendency measures

  <p>It uses the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) instead of mean and standard deviation</p>
  <p>The Modified Z-Score replaces the mean with the median and the standard deviation with the median absolute deviation (MAD). Since the median and MAD are not heavily influenced by extreme values in the dataset, the Modified Z-Score provides a more robust method for identifying outliers, especially in datasets that may already contain outliers that would skew the mean and standard deviation.</p>
