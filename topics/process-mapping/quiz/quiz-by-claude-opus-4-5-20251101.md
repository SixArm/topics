  <p>To visually represent workflows and identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and redundancies</p>
  <p>Process mapping is a technique used to visually represent the flow of work within an organization. Its primary goal is to provide a clear view of a process, helping analysts identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and redundancies so they can find ways to improve them. It is often used alongside other tools like workflow diagrams, swimlane diagrams, and value stream maps.</p>
