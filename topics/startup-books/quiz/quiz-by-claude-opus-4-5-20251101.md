  <p>Create a minimum viable product (MVP) and iterate based on customer feedback</p>
  <p>Eric Ries' "The Lean Startup" methodology emphasizes rapid experimentation, customer feedback, and continuous improvement. The core principle is to create a minimum viable product (MVP) and iterate on it based on real customer feedback, rather than spending extensive time and resources building a full product before testing market demand.</p>
