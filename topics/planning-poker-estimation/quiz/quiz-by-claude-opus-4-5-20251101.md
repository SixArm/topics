  <p>To avoid anchoring bias and groupthink</p>
  <p>When team members reveal their cards simultaneously rather than sequentially, it prevents individuals from being influenced by others' estimates before making their own judgment. This technique helps ensure each person provides an independent assessment, leading to more diverse perspectives and more accurate discussions about the true complexity of a user story or feature.</p>
