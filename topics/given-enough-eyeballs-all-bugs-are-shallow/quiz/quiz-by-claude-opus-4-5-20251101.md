# Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow

Question: What is the core premise behind Eric S. Raymond's phrase "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"?

- [ ] Proprietary software has fewer bugs because only trained professionals review the code
- [ ] Open-source projects have more contributors viewing the code, increasing the likelihood that bugs will be found and fixed
- [ ] Automated testing tools are more effective than human code review
- [ ] Software bugs become easier to fix as the codebase grows larger over time

  <p>Open-source projects have more contributors viewing the code, increasing the likelihood that bugs will be found and fixed</p>
  <p>Raymond's phrase captures the fundamental advantage of open-source development: when source code is publicly available, many developers and users can examine it. This broader scrutiny means more people are looking for potential issues, which increases the probability that bugs and defects will be identified and resolved—though it does not guarantee the software will be completely free of defects.</p>
