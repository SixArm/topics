  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</p>
  <p>The balance sheet is built on the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Equity. This equation states that everything a company owns (assets) must equal the sum of what it owes to others (liabilities) plus the residual value belonging to shareholders (equity). This equation must always balance, which is why the financial statement is called a "balance sheet." Understanding this equation is critical for technology professionals when evaluating a company's financial position, assessing investment opportunities, or analyzing the financial health of their own organization.</p>
