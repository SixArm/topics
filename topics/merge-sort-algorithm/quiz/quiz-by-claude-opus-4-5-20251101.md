# Merge sort algorithm

Question: What is the time complexity of merge sort?

- [ ] O(n²)
- [ ] O(n log n)
- [ ] O(n)
- [ ] O(log n)

  <p>O(n log n)</p>
  <p>Merge sort achieves O(n log n) time complexity because it divides the list in half at each level (log n divisions) and performs O(n) work at each level to merge the sublists. This consistent performance makes merge sort efficient for large datasets and guarantees predictable sorting time regardless of the initial order of elements.</p>
