  <p>It is created when employees take a technology or product from their employer to develop it as an independent company</p>
  <p>A spinout (also known as an employee spinout) specifically refers to a new independent company formed when employees leave their employer to develop a particular technology or product into a standalone business. Unlike subsidiaries, spinouts operate independently, and unlike general startups, they originate from existing company employees bringing technology or products with them. The original company may be supportive (potentially investing in the spinout) or hostile (potentially pursuing legal action), but the defining feature is employees creating an independent entity to pursue development they believe can be done more effectively outside the original organization.</p>
