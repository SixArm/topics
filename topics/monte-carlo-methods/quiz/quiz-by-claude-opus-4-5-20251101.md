  <p>Using repeated random sampling to estimate solutions to mathematical problems</p>
  <p>Monte Carlo methods are computational algorithms that use repeated random sampling from probability distributions to solve mathematical problems. By generating a large number of random samples and analyzing the results, these methods can estimate the behavior of complex systems and calculate probabilities or expected values, particularly when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain.</p>
