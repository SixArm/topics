# Inheritance

Question: What type of relationship does inheritance model between a base class and a derived class?

- [ ] A "has-a" relationship
- [ ] An "is-a" relationship
- [ ] A "uses-a" relationship
- [ ] A "contains-a" relationship

  <p>An "is-a" relationship</p>
  <p>Inheritance models an "is-a" relationship between classes. For example, if "Vehicle" is a base class and "Car" is a derived class, the relationship is "Car is a Vehicle." This distinguishes inheritance from composition, which models a "has-a" relationship where one object contains another.</p>
