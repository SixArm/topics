  <p>While WYSIWYG editors offer benefits like ease of use and no coding required, they have limitations compared to hand-coded approaches. The generated code can sometimes be bloated or have inconsistencies, and the visual representation may not always accurately reflect how the content will appear across different devices or platforms. This is an important trade-off for technology professionals to consider when deciding between visual editing tools and manual coding for complex or customized designs.</p>
