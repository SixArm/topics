# Continuous Integration

Question: What is the primary goal of Continuous Integration (CI)?

- [ ] To deploy code changes directly to production multiple times per day
- [ ] To eliminate the need for manual code reviews by automating all testing
- [ ] To identify and fix integration issues early in the development cycle before they become larger problems
- [ ] To replace the need for a shared repository by using distributed version control

  <p>To identify and fix integration issues early in the development cycle before they become larger problems</p>
  <p>CI involves frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests validate those changes. This early and frequent integration helps catch issues quickly, before they compound into larger, more costly problems. While CI uses automation for building and testing, its core purpose is early detection of integration issues, not eliminating code reviews or deploying directly to production.</p>
