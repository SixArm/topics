  <p>The total revenue potential of a market for a product or service</p>
  <p>TAM represents the total market demand for a particular product or service, expressed as the total revenue potential available. It is distinct from a company's actual revenue or market share—TAM shows the entire opportunity in the market, while actual revenue depends on what portion of that market a company captures after factoring in competition, pricing, and other variables.</p>
