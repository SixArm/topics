# Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

Question: What is the primary advantage of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) over Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?

- [ ] ABAC relies solely on user discretion to make access decisions
- [ ] ABAC can only evaluate user roles when determining access rights
- [ ] ABAC is limited to enterprise environments and cannot scale to smaller organizations
- [ ] ABAC can consider many different attributes beyond just user roles in access control decisions

  <p>ABAC can consider many different attributes beyond just user roles in access control decisions</p>
  <p>ABAC is more flexible than RBAC because it can evaluate multiple attributes—such as job titles, security clearances, location, time of day, and device type—when making access control decisions. This allows for more granular and context-aware access policies compared to RBAC, which is limited to role-based assignments.</p>
