# Peak testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of automated peak testing in software testing?

- [ ] To test user interface design elements and visual consistency
- [ ] To validate code syntax and identify compilation errors
- [ ] To evaluate system performance during extreme usage patterns and high-traffic periods
- [ ] To verify that software features match documented requirements

  <p>To evaluate system performance during extreme usage patterns and high-traffic periods</p>
  <p>Peak testing evaluates how a system performs during extreme usage patterns, high user volumes, and resource-intensive operations that occur during peak business hours or high-traffic periods. It monitors metrics like response times, throughput, CPU utilization, and memory consumption to identify bottlenecks, crashes, and degraded performance, helping teams understand an application's breaking point and capacity limitations.</p>
