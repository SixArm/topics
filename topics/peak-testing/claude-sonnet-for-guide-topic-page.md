# Peak testing

Peak testing in software testing automation refers to evaluating system performance during extreme usage patterns, high user volumes, and resource-intensive operations that may occur during peak business hours or high-traffic periods.

Automated peak testing involves creating scripts and tools that simulate peaks. The automation aspect enables consistent, repeatable testing that would be practically impossible to achieve manually.

During peak testing, key performance metrics are monitored including response times, throughput, CPU utilization, memory consumption, database performance, and network bandwidth usage. The testing identifies bottlenecks, memory leaks, system crashes, and degraded performance that might occur under extreme conditions. This helps development teams understand the application's breaking point and capacity limitations.

The benefits of automated peak testing include early identification of performance issues, validation of system scalability, reduced risk of production failures, and improved user experience during high-traffic periods. Organizations can proactively optimize their systems based on peak testing results, ensuring applications remain stable and responsive even under maximum expected loads. This testing approach is particularly crucial for e-commerce platforms, banking systems, and other applications experiencing predictable traffic spikes.
