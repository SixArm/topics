# Split testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of randomly allocating users to different variations in split testing?

- [ ] To increase the total number of users participating in the test
- [ ] To ensure fair distribution and minimize bias in the results
- [ ] To speed up the data collection process
- [ ] To guarantee that the newer variation always wins

  <p>To ensure fair distribution and minimize bias in the results</p>
  <p>Random allocation is a critical step in split testing because it ensures that each variation receives a representative sample of users. This minimizes selection bias and ensures that any observed differences in performance between variations can be attributed to the variations themselves rather than to differences in the user groups exposed to them. Without random allocation, the statistical validity of the test results would be compromised.</p>
