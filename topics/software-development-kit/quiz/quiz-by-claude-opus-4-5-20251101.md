  <p>To provide developers with tools, libraries, APIs, and resources for building applications for a specific platform</p>
  <p>An SDK is a collection of development resources—including libraries with pre-written code, APIs for accessing system features, development tools like IDEs and debuggers, and sample code—that simplifies building software for a specific platform, operating system, or framework. It enables developers to leverage existing components rather than building everything from scratch.</p>
