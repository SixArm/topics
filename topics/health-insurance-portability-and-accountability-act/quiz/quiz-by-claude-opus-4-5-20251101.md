  <p>Administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability</p>
  <p>The HIPAA Security Rule establishes standards specifically for electronic PHI (ePHI) and requires covered entities to implement three categories of safeguards: administrative (policies and procedures), physical (facility access controls), and technical (access controls, encryption, audit controls). These safeguards work together to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI—the core security triad that technology professionals must address when building or maintaining systems that handle health information.</p>
