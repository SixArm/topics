  <p>A central idea with branches radiating outward to related subtopics</p>
  <p>A mind map is created by placing the main idea in the center of the diagram, then adding branches that radiate out to represent related subtopics or ideas. This radial structure distinguishes mind maps from linear note-taking and enables visual and spatial relationships that improve organization, creativity, and memory retention.</p>
