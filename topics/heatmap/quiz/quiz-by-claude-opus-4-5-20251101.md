  <p>The area has high user interaction or attention</p>
  <p>Heatmaps use a color spectrum where warm colors (red, orange) represent hotspots with higher frequency or intensity of user interactions such as clicks, taps, or cursor movement. Cooler colors (blue) indicate areas with less user activity. This visualization helps designers identify which elements are engaging users and which are being ignored.</p>
