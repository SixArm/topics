  <p>The longest sequence of dependent activities that determines the project's minimum duration</p>
  <p>The critical path represents the longest sequence of dependent activities in a project. Any delay in completing these activities will result in a delay in the entire project. This is why identifying the critical path is essential for project managers—it shows which activities must be completed on time to meet the project deadline, and where resources should be focused to ensure timely completion.</p>
