  <p>When overall conditions improve in an industry or economy, all participants tend to benefit</p>
  <p>The phrase emphasizes that general positive trends or growth in a particular domain—such as a technology market expansion or favorable economic conditions—will have positive effects on all participants within that area, regardless of their individual size or position. However, it's important to note that while everyone may benefit, they won't necessarily benefit equally; specific circumstances and actions taken to capitalize on positive trends will influence individual outcomes.</p>
