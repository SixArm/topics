# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Question: In reinforcement learning, what is the primary objective of an agent?

- [ ] To minimize the number of interactions with the environment
- [ ] To maximize the cumulative rewards over time
- [ ] To explore all possible states exactly once
- [ ] To memorize the correct action for each individual state

  <p>To maximize the cumulative rewards over time</p>
  <p>The fundamental goal in reinforcement learning is for the agent to find a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time. Through trial-and-error interaction with the environment, the agent learns which actions lead to the best long-term outcomes by collecting reward feedback and updating its policy accordingly.</p>
