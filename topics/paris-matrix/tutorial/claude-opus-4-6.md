# PARIS matrix

## Introduction

The PARIS matrix is a responsibility assignment framework used in project management to define and communicate the roles that individuals and teams play across tasks, deliverables, and decisions. PARIS stands for Participate, Approve, Responsible, Input, and Sign-off. It belongs to the broader family of Responsibility Assignment Matrices (RAMs), which includes well-known variants such as RACI and RASCI. The PARIS matrix is particularly valued in organizations that need clear distinctions between active contribution, formal authority, and advisory functions, making it well-suited for complex projects with multiple stakeholders and governance requirements.

## What PARIS Stands For

Each letter in the PARIS acronym represents a distinct level of involvement in a task or activity. Understanding these levels is essential for correct application of the matrix.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Participate** | The individual is actively involved in executing the task. They contribute effort and may own subtasks, but they are not the sole accountable party for the overall deliverable. |
| **Approve** | The individual holds formal authority to approve or reject the output of a task. They review work against quality standards and acceptance criteria before it can proceed. |
| **Responsible** | The individual owns the task end-to-end. They ensure it is completed on time, within scope, and to the required quality standard. There should typically be one Responsible party per task. |
| **Input** | The individual provides expertise, data, feedback, or guidance that informs the work. They are consulted but do not directly execute or govern the task. |
| **Sign-off** | The individual has the final authority to formally close or accept the task. They confirm that all work is complete, all approvals have been obtained, and the deliverable meets organizational standards. |

## How PARIS Differs from RACI

The PARIS matrix and the RACI matrix serve similar purposes, but they differ in how they decompose authority and participation. The table below highlights the key distinctions.

| Dimension | RACI | PARIS |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Accountability** | Explicit "Accountable" role for a single decision-maker | Distributed across Approve and Sign-off roles |
| **Consultation** | "Consulted" role for two-way communication | "Input" role for advisory contribution |
| **Execution** | "Responsible" for doing the work | "Responsible" for owning the work; "Participate" for contributing to it |
| **Governance layers** | Single approval implied by Accountable | Separate Approve (interim quality gate) and Sign-off (final closure) |
| **Notification** | "Informed" role for one-way updates | Not explicitly included; can be added as an extension |

The PARIS matrix is especially useful when a project has distinct approval checkpoints at different stages, such as a technical review before a management sign-off.

## When to Use the PARIS Matrix

The PARIS matrix is most effective in the following situations:

- **Regulated industries**: Projects in healthcare, finance, or government often require multiple levels of formal approval and sign-off. PARIS separates these clearly.
- **Cross-functional teams**: When contributors come from different departments or organizations, distinguishing between participation and responsibility reduces ambiguity.
- **Multi-stage deliverables**: When a deliverable passes through design, review, approval, and acceptance phases, the Approve and Sign-off distinction maps naturally to these stages.
- **Governance-heavy environments**: Organizations with mature project management offices (PMOs) benefit from the explicit governance layers built into the matrix.

## How to Build a PARIS Matrix

Building an effective PARIS matrix involves several steps:

1. **Identify all tasks and deliverables**: List every major task, milestone, or decision point in the project work breakdown structure.
2. **Identify all roles and individuals**: List every person or team that has a stake in the project, including contributors, managers, and external stakeholders.
3. **Assign PARIS roles**: For each task-role intersection, assign one of the five PARIS designations. Ensure that every task has exactly one Responsible party and at least one Sign-off authority.
4. **Validate with stakeholders**: Review the matrix with all named parties to confirm that assignments are accurate, understood, and accepted.
5. **Publish and maintain**: Distribute the matrix as a living document. Revisit it at phase gates, when team composition changes, or when scope evolves.

## Best Practices

- **Limit the Responsible role to one person per task.** Shared responsibility often leads to diffusion of accountability.
- **Distinguish Approve from Sign-off deliberately.** Approve is a quality gate during execution; Sign-off is a formal closure event. Collapsing these into one role defeats the purpose of the PARIS model.
- **Keep the matrix concise.** A matrix that tries to cover every micro-task becomes unwieldy. Focus on deliverables and key decisions.
- **Communicate the matrix early.** Share it during project kickoff so that all parties understand their obligations before work begins.
- **Review the matrix regularly.** Projects evolve, and role assignments should evolve with them. Schedule reviews at major milestones or phase transitions.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Assigning too many Participate roles**: If nearly everyone is marked as Participate on every task, the designation loses meaning and meetings become overcrowded.
- **Confusing Input with Participate**: Input contributors advise; Participants execute. Treating advisory stakeholders as active contributors creates unnecessary coordination overhead.
- **Omitting Sign-off**: Without a clear Sign-off authority, deliverables may linger in an ambiguous state where no one has formally accepted the work.
- **Static matrices**: A PARIS matrix created at project initiation and never updated will drift out of alignment with reality, causing confusion rather than clarity.

## Summary

The PARIS matrix is a structured responsibility assignment tool that clarifies who Participates in, Approves, is Responsible for, provides Input to, and Signs off on each task in a project. By separating interim approval from final sign-off and distinguishing active participation from advisory input, the PARIS matrix provides finer-grained role clarity than simpler models like RACI. It is particularly well-suited for governance-intensive, regulated, or cross-functional environments where multiple authority layers exist. When built carefully, communicated early, and maintained throughout the project lifecycle, the PARIS matrix reduces ambiguity, prevents role conflicts, and contributes directly to project success.
