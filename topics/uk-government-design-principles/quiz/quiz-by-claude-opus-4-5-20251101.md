  <p>Start with user needs and iterate based on feedback</p>
  <p>The UK Government Design Principles emphasize "Start with user needs" as the first principle—conducting research, analyzing data, and talking to users rather than making assumptions. This is reinforced by the "Iterate" principle, which recommends releasing minimum viable products early, testing with actual users, and making refinements based on feedback. Together, these principles establish a user-centered, iterative approach as fundamental to building effective government digital services.</p>
