  <p>Describing what the program should accomplish rather than how to accomplish it</p>
  <p>Declarative programming focuses on specifying the desired output or result, and the programming language automatically determines the necessary steps to achieve that result. This contrasts with imperative programming, which requires the programmer to explicitly define step-by-step instructions for how to accomplish tasks.</p>
