# Agile quotations

Kent Beck's observation that "I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits" highlights the importance of consistent practices over individual brilliance. This mindset aligns perfectly with agile's emphasis on sustainable development and continuous improvement through small, incremental changes.

Martin Fowler's insight that "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand" underscores the collaborative nature of agile development. Clean, readable code becomes essential when teams work closely together and frequently refactor their work.

Mary Poppendieck observes, "The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great at whatever they want to do." Agile leadership focuses on empowerment and motivation rather than command and control.

Ron Jeffries emphasizes, "Code never lies, comments sometimes do." This underscores the agile preference for clean, self-documenting code over extensive written documentation that may become outdated.
