  <p>Your investigation is focused on the wrong cause or component</p>
  <p>"Barking up the wrong tree" means pursuing a mistaken or misguided course of action. In a technology context, this idiom indicates that your efforts or assumptions are misdirected—you're looking in the wrong place for the root cause of an issue. The phrase originated from hunting dogs that would bark at a tree where they incorrectly believed prey was hiding, when the actual target was elsewhere. When applied to debugging or problem-solving, it's a signal to reassess your assumptions and redirect your investigation to a different area.</p>
