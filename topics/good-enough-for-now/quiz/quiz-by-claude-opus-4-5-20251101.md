  <p>To deliver functional solutions that meet current requirements while allowing for future refinement</p>
  <p>GEFN is rooted in iterative development and agile methodologies. It encourages teams to deliver functional, reliable code quickly to meet immediate needs, rather than striving for perfection at every stage. This approach allows teams to prioritize critical features first while leaving room for future enhancements based on feedback. However, teams must balance speed with quality to avoid accumulating technical debt.</p>
