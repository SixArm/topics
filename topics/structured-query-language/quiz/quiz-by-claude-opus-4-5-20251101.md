  <p>Data Definition Language (DDL)</p>
  <p>DDL statements are specifically designed to define and modify database schema and structure. This includes creating, altering, and dropping tables, views, indexes, and stored procedures. In contrast, DML handles data manipulation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), DCL manages access permissions (GRANT, REVOKE), and TCL controls transactions (COMMIT, ROLLBACK).</p>
