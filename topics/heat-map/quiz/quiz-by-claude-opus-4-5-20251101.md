# Heat map

Question: What is the primary purpose of using color gradients (cool to warm colors) in a heat map?

- [ ] To make the visualization more aesthetically pleasing for presentations
- [ ] To represent low to high values or levels of intensity in the data
- [ ] To distinguish between different data categories using arbitrary color assignments
- [ ] To comply with accessibility standards for colorblind users

  <p>To represent low to high values or levels of intensity in the data</p>
  <p>Heat maps use color gradients ranging from cool colors (blue, green) to warm colors (yellow, orange, red) to visually encode data values. This allows users to quickly identify areas of high or low concentration, trends, or anomalies in the data without needing to examine individual numerical values. The intuitive color mapping makes patterns in large, complex datasets immediately visible.</p>
