  <p>Tracking student learning patterns to provide tailored learning pathways that optimize engagement and achievement</p>
  <p>Adaptive learning is one of the most impactful applications of AI in edtech. These platforms analyze individual student learning patterns, identify strengths and weaknesses, and dynamically adjust the learning pathway for each student. This personalization helps optimize both student engagement and academic achievement by meeting learners where they are, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
