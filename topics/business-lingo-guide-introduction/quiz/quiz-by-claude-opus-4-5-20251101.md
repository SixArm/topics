  <p>It creates shared context and clearer communication, accelerating collaboration</p>
  <p>The guide emphasizes that shared glossaries help "create shared context and clearer communication," which can "accelerate working together" and help teams "forge better project plans." This is described metaphorically as "singing from the same songbook" — when everyone understands the same terminology and has access to the same definitions, teamwork becomes more effective.</p>
