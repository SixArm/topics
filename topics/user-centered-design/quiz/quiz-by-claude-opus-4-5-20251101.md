  <p>Placing the needs, goals, and preferences of end users at the forefront of the design process</p>
  <p>User-centered design (UCD) is fundamentally about understanding users through research and iterative testing, then using that knowledge to guide design decisions. This approach involves users throughout the design process via techniques such as user research, interviews, surveys, and usability testing, resulting in improved user satisfaction, enhanced usability, reduced development costs, and competitive advantage.</p>
