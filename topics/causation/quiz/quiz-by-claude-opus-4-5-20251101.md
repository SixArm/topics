Question: What is the key distinction between correlation and causation in data analysis?

- [ ] Correlation requires larger sample sizes than causation studies
- [ ] Causation can be established simply by observing that two variables change together
- [ ] Correlation measures the strength of a relationship, while causation establishes that one variable directly produces an effect on another
- [ ] Correlation and causation are interchangeable terms in statistical analysis

  <p>Correlation measures the strength of a relationship, while causation establishes that one variable directly produces an effect on another</p>
  <p>Establishing correlation alone does not imply causation. To establish causation, rigorous methods such as randomized controlled trials, longitudinal studies, counterfactual analysis, or mechanism-based reasoning are required to demonstrate that one variable actually causes a change in another, while controlling for other potential factors that may influence the outcome.</p>
