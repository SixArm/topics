  <p>To involve users throughout the design process and create interfaces aligned with user needs and expectations</p>
  <p>User-Centered Design is a foundational HCI principle that emphasizes understanding user needs, conducting user research, and incorporating user feedback throughout the design process. This approach ensures that the resulting interfaces align with user expectations and goals, leading to more usable and effective systems. It stands in contrast to technology-driven or aesthetics-first approaches that may overlook actual user requirements.</p>
