# Take an Economic View: Tutorial

## Overview

"Take an economic view" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) Principle 1 -- and its position as the first principle is deliberate. It establishes that all decisions in Lean-Agile development must be grounded in sound economics. The ultimate goal of SAFe is to deliver "the best value and quality for people and society in the shortest sustainable lead time," and achieving this requires that everyday decisions be made within a proper economic context.

This tutorial equips change technology professionals with a thorough understanding of what it means to take an economic view, why it matters, and how to embed economic thinking into the daily practices of agile teams and organizations.

## Key Concepts

### The Economics of Building Systems

Building systems involves navigating a complex web of economic trade-offs. These include:

- **Risk:** The probability and impact of adverse outcomes, including technical risk, market risk, and schedule risk.
- **Cost of Delay (CoD):** The economic impact of not delivering a feature or capability sooner. CoD is often the single most important economic variable and the one most commonly ignored.
- **Development costs:** The cost of building the solution, including labor, tools, and infrastructure.
- **Manufacturing and operational costs:** The ongoing costs of producing, deploying, and maintaining the solution.
- **Transaction costs:** The overhead associated with each release, handoff, or coordination activity.

Understanding these trade-offs allows teams to make decisions that optimize total economic outcomes rather than minimizing any single cost in isolation.

### Cost of Delay

Cost of Delay is a central concept in SAFe's economic framework. It quantifies the economic impact of time on value delivery. A feature that could generate significant revenue but is delayed by three months has a calculable Cost of Delay. By making CoD visible, organizations can prioritize work based on economic impact rather than subjective opinion or political influence.

Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is SAFe's recommended prioritization method, which uses CoD divided by job duration to sequence work for maximum economic benefit.

### Operating Within Budget Guardrails

Each development value stream must operate within the context of an approved budget. SAFe uses Lean budgets rather than traditional project-based funding, allocating budgets to value streams and establishing guardrails that define spending policies, investment mix, and approval thresholds. This approach supports decentralized decision-making while maintaining fiduciary responsibility.

### Incremental Value Delivery

Taking an economic view also means adopting a strategy of incremental value delivery. Delivering value in small batches reduces risk, provides faster feedback, and generates return on investment earlier. The economic case for incrementalism is compelling: it reduces the total Cost of Delay by getting valuable capabilities into users' hands sooner.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Make Cost of Delay visible.** For every significant feature or initiative, estimate the Cost of Delay. Even rough estimates create economic awareness and improve prioritization. Ask: "What is the cost per week of not having this capability?"

2. **Adopt WSJF for prioritization.** Use Weighted Shortest Job First to sequence your backlog. Calculate CoD (combining user-business value, time criticality, and risk reduction/opportunity enablement) and divide by job size. Prioritize the highest WSJF items first.

3. **Establish Lean budgets for value streams.** Move away from project-based funding that requires detailed upfront cost estimates. Instead, allocate budgets to persistent value streams and establish guardrails that empower teams to make economic decisions within defined boundaries.

4. **Train teams in economic thinking.** Every team member should understand the basic economic framework within which they operate. This includes understanding CoD, the trade-off between development speed and quality, and how their daily decisions affect overall economics.

5. **Quantify trade-offs explicitly.** When facing decisions -- such as whether to fix technical debt, add a new feature, or invest in automation -- frame the options in economic terms. What is the cost of each option? What is the expected return? What is the Cost of Delay?

6. **Reduce batch sizes.** Smaller batches reduce risk and accelerate feedback. Analyze your current batch sizes (release size, planning horizon, feature scope) and look for opportunities to reduce them, thereby improving economic outcomes.

7. **Minimize transaction costs.** High transaction costs (deployment costs, coordination costs, approval costs) discourage small batches and fast delivery. Invest in reducing these costs through automation, simplified processes, and decentralized authority.

8. **Sequence work for economic benefit.** Do not simply prioritize by business value alone. Consider the time dimension: a moderately valuable feature with a high Cost of Delay should often be built before a highly valuable feature with a low Cost of Delay.

9. **Review economic outcomes regularly.** At PI boundaries and other milestones, review whether value delivery is tracking to economic expectations. Use objective data from working systems rather than progress reports based on completed tasks.

10. **Build economic literacy into your culture.** Make economic reasoning a natural part of daily conversations. When a team member proposes an approach, the question "What is the economic impact?" should feel normal, not adversarial.

## Key Takeaway

Taking an economic view means grounding every decision -- from daily development choices to strategic portfolio prioritization -- in sound economic reasoning. Cost of Delay is the most critical concept to master, as it provides a common language for quantifying the time-value trade-offs inherent in software development. Change technology professionals who embed economic thinking into their organizations will make better prioritization decisions, reduce waste, and deliver value faster and more sustainably. This principle is the foundation upon which all other SAFe principles build.
