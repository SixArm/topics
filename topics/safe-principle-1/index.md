# Take an economic view

"Take an economic view" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 1.

Delivering the ‘best value and quality for people and society in the shortest
sustainable lead time’ requires a fundamental understanding of the economics of
building systems. Everyday decisions must be made in a proper economic context.
This includes the strategy for incremental value delivery and the broader
economic framework for each value stream. This framework highlights the
trade-offs between risk, Cost of Delay (CoD), manufacturing, operational, and
development costs. In addition, every development value stream must operate
within the context of an approved budget and be compliant with the guardrails
which support decentralized decision-making.
