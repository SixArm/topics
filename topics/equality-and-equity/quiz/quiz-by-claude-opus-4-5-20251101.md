  <p>Equality focuses on treating everyone the same regardless of circumstances, while equity addresses individual needs and existing disparities to achieve fairness</p>
  <p>Equality provides the same treatment and opportunities to all individuals without considering their circumstances. Equity recognizes that individuals have different needs and starting points, and aims to achieve fairness by addressing existing disparities and providing resources in a way that is responsive to each person's unique situation. For technology professionals, this distinction matters when designing accessible systems, allocating team resources, or creating inclusive policies.</p>
