  <p>The removal of trade barriers such as tariffs and quotas</p>
  <p>Economic globalization is characterized by the free flow of goods, services, capital, and labor across borders, which is facilitated by the removal of trade barriers like tariffs and quotas. This enables multinational corporations to source materials, produce, and distribute goods across different countries, creating global supply chains. International organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO) promote and regulate this global trade.</p>
