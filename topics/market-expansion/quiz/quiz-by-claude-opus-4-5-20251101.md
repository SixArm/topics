  <p>To enter new markets, expand customer base, and increase presence beyond current offerings</p>
  <p>Market expansion is a strategic initiative that involves entering new markets (geographic, demographic, or product-based), expanding the customer base, and increasing a company's presence beyond its current geographical areas, demographic targets, or product/service offerings. This contrasts with strategies focused on cost-cutting, consolidation, or purely improving existing offerings for existing customers.</p>
