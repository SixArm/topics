  <p>To help search engines better understand webpage content and provide more relevant search results</p>
  <p>Schema.org is a collaborative effort to create structured data markup that helps search engines understand the context and meaning of webpage content. By using shared vocabulary and schemas (types) implemented in formats like microdata, RDFa, and JSON-LD, webmasters can describe their content more precisely, leading to improved search visibility, more accurate search results, and better user engagement.</p>
