# Chaos testing

Question: What is the primary purpose of chaos testing in software systems?

- [ ] To optimize application performance by identifying slow database queries
- [ ] To validate that user interface elements render correctly across browsers
- [ ] To intentionally introduce failures to evaluate system resilience and recovery capabilities
- [ ] To ensure code coverage meets minimum thresholds during unit testing

  <p>To intentionally introduce failures to evaluate system resilience and recovery capabilities</p>
  <p>Chaos testing is a methodology that proactively introduces failures and disruptions—such as server crashes, network partitions, or resource exhaustion—to identify weaknesses in infrastructure before they cause critical production outages. This approach helps teams understand failure modes, implement safeguards like circuit breakers and retry mechanisms, and build confidence in system architecture, particularly for distributed systems where complex interdependencies can lead to cascading failures.</p>
