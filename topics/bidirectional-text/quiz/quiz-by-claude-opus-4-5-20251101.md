# Bidirectional text (bidi)

Question: When designing a user interface that supports bidirectional text, what is a critical consideration for layout and alignment?

- [ ] Using only monospace fonts to ensure consistent character width
- [ ] Mirroring the alignment of UI elements when switching between LTR and RTL layouts
- [ ] Disabling text selection to prevent cursor direction conflicts
- [ ] Restricting input to a single text direction per text field

  <p>Mirroring the alignment of UI elements when switching between LTR and RTL layouts</p>
  <p>When supporting bidirectional text, UI layouts must adapt alignment to match the text direction. In RTL languages like Arabic or Hebrew, element alignment should be mirrored compared to LTR layouts—for example, navigation that appears on the left in LTR should move to the right in RTL. This ensures the interface follows the natural reading flow of the user's language.</p>
