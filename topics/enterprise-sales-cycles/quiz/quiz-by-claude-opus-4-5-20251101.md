  <p>Enterprise sales cycles are characterized by their complexity compared to consumer sales. Large organizations have multiple decision-makers, formal procurement procedures, and extended evaluation periods. This requires salespeople to navigate various stakeholders, conduct in-depth needs assessments, and manage relationships across multiple stages from prospecting through implementation and ongoing expansion.</p>
