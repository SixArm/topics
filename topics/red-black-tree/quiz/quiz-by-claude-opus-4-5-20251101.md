  <p>Black Depth Property</p>
  <p>The Black Depth Property states that for each node, any simple path from that node to any of its descendant leaves must have the same number of black nodes. This property is the key mechanism that ensures the tree remains balanced, guaranteeing that the longest path from root to leaf is at most twice as long as the shortest path.</p>
