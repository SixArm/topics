  <p>Calculating total production costs and adding a markup percentage</p>
  <p>Cost-plus pricing works by first calculating all direct and indirect costs associated with producing a product or service (including labor, raw materials, overhead, and other expenses), then adding a markup expressed as a percentage of the total cost. This markup ensures the business covers all costs and makes a profit on each sale. While this method provides predictability and simplicity, technology professionals should note that it doesn't account for customer-perceived value or competitive market dynamics.</p>
