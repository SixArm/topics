  <p>Build position or exit the market</p>
  <p>When a market has low attractiveness but the business holds a strong competitive position, the strategy is to maintain the competitive advantage while exploring opportunities to transition or pivot into more attractive markets. This "Build/Exit" approach acknowledges that while the market itself may not be growing, the strong position can still be leveraged—either to build toward adjacent opportunities or to plan a strategic exit while still in a position of strength.</p>
