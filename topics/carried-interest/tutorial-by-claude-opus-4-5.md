## Carried Interest: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

### What is Carried Interest?

Carried interest—commonly called "carry"—is the share of investment profits that general partners (GPs) of private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds receive as compensation for managing the fund and generating returns. It represents a performance-based incentive that aligns the interests of fund managers with their investors.

For technology professionals, understanding carried interest is essential whether you're evaluating startup equity, considering roles at VC-backed companies, or exploring careers in venture capital or private equity.

## How Fund Structures Work

Private investment funds operate with two primary classes of participants:

| Participant | Role | Capital Contribution | Compensation |
|-------------|------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Limited Partners (LPs)** | Passive investors (pension funds, endowments, family offices, high-net-worth individuals) | Provide 95-99% of fund capital | Receive investment returns after fees |
| **General Partners (GPs)** | Active fund managers who source deals, make investment decisions, and provide portfolio support | Typically contribute 1-5% of fund capital | Receive management fees + carried interest |

## The Economics of Carried Interest

### Standard Terms

The venture capital and private equity industry has converged on relatively standard carried interest terms:

- **Carry percentage**: Typically 20% of profits (though top-tier funds may command 25-30%)
- **Management fee**: Usually 2% of committed capital annually
- **Hurdle rate**: Often 8% preferred return to LPs before carry kicks in
- **GP commitment**: 1-5% of fund size, invested alongside LPs

### How Carry is Calculated

Carried interest is calculated on profits above the initial investment and hurdle rate:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Committed Capital** | Total amount LPs agree to invest |
| **Contributed Capital** | Actual capital called and deployed |
| **Preferred Return (Hurdle)** | Minimum return LPs receive before GPs earn carry |
| **Profit** | Returns above contributed capital + preferred return |
| **Carried Interest** | GP's percentage of profits (typically 20%) |

**Example calculation:**
- Fund size: $100 million
- Fund returns: $300 million (3x)
- Hurdle rate: 8% (assume $8 million)
- Profit after hurdle: $192 million
- GP carry (20%): $38.4 million
- LP share (80%): $153.6 million + $108 million (capital + hurdle) = $261.6 million

## Distribution Waterfalls

Funds use waterfall structures to determine how profits flow to participants:

### American Waterfall (Deal-by-Deal)

- GPs receive carry as each investment is realized
- Faster carry distribution for GPs
- Includes "clawback" provisions if later deals underperform

### European Waterfall (Whole Fund)

- LPs receive all contributed capital back first
- Then LPs receive preferred return
- Only then do GPs receive carried interest
- More LP-friendly structure

| Waterfall Type | GP Carry Timing | Risk to GPs | LP Protection |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| American | Earlier | Lower | Lower (relies on clawback) |
| European | Later | Higher | Higher |

## Key Terms Technology Professionals Should Know

- **Vesting**: Carry typically vests over 3-5 years to retain team members
- **Clawback**: Provision requiring GPs to return excess carry if fund underperforms overall
- **Catch-up**: After LPs receive preferred return, GPs may receive 100% of profits until they "catch up" to their carry percentage
- **High-water mark**: Ensures GPs only earn carry on new profits, not recovered losses
- **Crystallization**: The point at which carry becomes payable

## Tax Treatment and Controversy

Carried interest receives favorable tax treatment in many jurisdictions:

| Income Type | US Federal Tax Rate (2024) |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Ordinary income (salary) | Up to 37% |
| Long-term capital gains | 20% (+ 3.8% NIIT) |
| Carried interest (held 3+ years) | 20% (+ 3.8% NIIT) |

**Arguments for current treatment:**
- GPs risk their time and reputation
- Aligns GP incentives with long-term value creation
- Encourages entrepreneurship and innovation funding

**Arguments against current treatment:**
- GPs risk little capital compared to LPs
- Similar to performance bonuses, which are taxed as ordinary income
- Creates tax advantages for wealthy fund managers

## Why This Matters for Technology Professionals

### If You Work at a VC-Backed Startup

Understanding carry helps you:
- Comprehend your investors' incentives and time horizons
- Recognize why VCs push for larger exits (bigger carry)
- Understand board dynamics and decision-making

### If You're Considering VC/PE Careers

Carry economics affect your compensation:
- Junior roles: Small or no carry allocation
- Senior associates/principals: Modest carry points
- Partners: Significant carry allocation (often 5-15% of GP's total carry pool)

### If You're Evaluating Investment Opportunities

LP perspective considerations:
- Fund terms (carry %, hurdle, waterfall structure)
- GP track record and fund performance
- Alignment of interests through GP commitment

## Comparison: Carry vs. Other Compensation

| Compensation Type | Tax Treatment | Liquidity | Risk Profile |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| Salary | Ordinary income | Immediate | Low |
| Annual bonus | Ordinary income | Annual | Low-Medium |
| Stock options | Capital gains (if qualified) | At exercise/sale | Medium-High |
| Carried interest | Capital gains | At fund distributions | High |

## Timeline of a Typical Fund

| Year | Activity | Carry Status |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 1-3 | Investment period (deploying capital) | No carry distributed |
| 3-5 | Portfolio management and follow-on investments | Early exits may generate carry (American) |
| 5-7 | Harvest period (seeking exits) | Majority of carry realized |
| 7-10+ | Final exits and fund wind-down | Remaining carry distributed |

## Summary

Carried interest is the primary mechanism through which fund managers participate in investment upside. For technology professionals navigating the startup ecosystem—whether as founders, employees, or investors—understanding carry provides insight into:

- How VCs and PE firms are incentivized
- Why fund managers push for certain outcomes
- The economics behind fund structures
- Career compensation in investment management

The 20% carry / 2% management fee structure (often called "2 and 20") has become industry standard, though terms vary based on fund performance, size, and negotiating leverage. As you advance in your technology career, this knowledge will prove valuable whether you're raising capital, joining a portfolio company, or transitioning into investment roles.
