  <p>Carried interest is structured as a share of profits (commonly 20%) that general partners receive after limited partners have received their initial capital plus a minimum rate of return (the hurdle rate). This incentivizes GPs to generate strong returns, as their compensation is directly tied to fund performance rather than being a fixed fee.</p>
