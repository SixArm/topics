# Carried interest

Carried interest, commonly known as "carry," is the share of investment profits that general partners (GPs) of private equity, venture capital, and other alternative investment funds receive as compensation for managing and growing the fund. It is the primary performance-based incentive in fund management, aligning the interests of fund managers with those of their investors. For technology professionals — whether founding startups, joining venture-backed companies, or evaluating fund structures — understanding carried interest is essential for navigating the financial mechanics behind venture capital and private equity deals.

## How carried interest works

In a typical fund structure, limited partners (LPs) contribute the vast majority of the capital, while general partners (GPs) manage the fund, source deals, and make investment decisions. The GPs are compensated through two main channels: a management fee (usually 2% of committed capital annually) and carried interest (usually 20% of the fund's profits). This arrangement is often referred to as the "2 and 20" model.

Carried interest is not paid upfront. It is only realized when the fund generates returns above a specified minimum threshold, known as the hurdle rate (or preferred return). Once that threshold is met, the GP receives their carry as a percentage of the profits beyond that point. This means that if a fund does not perform well, the GP earns no carry at all.

## Key terms and components

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| General Partner (GP) | The fund manager responsible for investment decisions and fund operations |
| Limited Partner (LP) | The investor who contributes capital but does not manage the fund |
| Management Fee | An annual fee (typically 2%) paid to the GP regardless of fund performance |
| Carried Interest | The GP's share of profits (typically 20%), paid only when performance thresholds are met |
| Hurdle Rate | The minimum rate of return that must be delivered to LPs before carry is distributed |
| Clawback Provision | A clause requiring the GP to return excess carry if later investments underperform |
| Distribution Waterfall | The sequence and rules governing how profits are distributed among LPs and GPs |
| High-Water Mark | Ensures carry is only earned on net new profits, not on recovery of prior losses |

## Distribution waterfall

The distribution waterfall defines the order in which fund profits are allocated. There are two primary models:

- **European (whole-fund) waterfall.** Carried interest is calculated on the entire fund's performance. The GP receives carry only after all invested capital has been returned to LPs and the hurdle rate has been met across the whole portfolio. This model is more favorable to LPs.

- **American (deal-by-deal) waterfall.** Carried interest is calculated on each individual deal. The GP can receive carry from profitable exits even if other investments in the fund have lost money. This model is more favorable to GPs but typically includes clawback provisions to reconcile at the end of the fund's life.

## Typical fund economics

| Component | Typical Value |
|---|---|
| LP capital contribution | 99% of committed capital |
| GP capital contribution | 1% of committed capital |
| Management fee | 1.5%–2.5% per year |
| Carried interest rate | 20% (can range from 15%–30% for top-tier firms) |
| Hurdle rate | 7%–8% preferred return |
| Fund lifetime | 10 years (with possible extensions) |

## Carried interest and taxation

Carried interest is one of the most debated topics in tax policy. In the United States and several other jurisdictions, carry is taxed as long-term capital gains rather than as ordinary income. This means the effective tax rate on carry is significantly lower than the rate applied to salaries and wages.

- **Proponents** argue that the capital gains treatment is justified because GPs take on significant risk, often invest their own capital, and the returns are realized over long holding periods. They also contend that the incentive structure drives innovation and capital formation, particularly in the technology sector.

- **Critics** argue that carry is functionally a performance fee for services rendered, and should be taxed as ordinary income. They point out that GPs contribute a small fraction of the fund's capital but receive a disproportionate share of the upside, and that the tax benefit primarily advantages high-net-worth individuals.

Legislative efforts to reclassify carried interest as ordinary income have surfaced multiple times in the U.S., with some reforms requiring a minimum three-year holding period to qualify for capital gains treatment.

## Why technology professionals should care

Carried interest has direct implications across the technology industry:

- **Startup founders** negotiate with VCs whose fund economics are shaped by carry. Understanding carry helps founders assess whether investor incentives are aligned with long-term company building or short-term exits.

- **Employees at VC-backed companies** benefit from understanding how fund timelines and carry structures influence board decisions, exit timing, and growth strategies.

- **Technology executives evaluating fund roles** or venture partner positions need to understand how carry is allocated, vested, and distributed within a firm.

- **Angel investors and LPs** from the technology sector who invest in funds should understand how carry affects their net returns and how waterfall structures determine when and how they get paid.

## Vesting and allocation of carry

Carried interest within a GP entity is typically allocated among the partners and investment professionals of the firm. Key considerations include:

- **Vesting schedules.** Carry typically vests over 3–5 years, incentivizing team retention across the fund's lifecycle.
- **Tiered allocation.** Senior partners generally receive a larger share, with junior partners and associates receiving smaller allocations that grow over time.
- **Forfeiture clauses.** Professionals who leave the firm before vesting may forfeit unvested carry.
- **Carry pools.** Some firms reserve a portion of carry for future hires, creating a "carry pool" analogous to an employee stock option pool at a startup.

## Summary

Carried interest is the cornerstone of performance-based compensation in private equity and venture capital, giving general partners a meaningful share of fund profits in exchange for sourcing, managing, and growing investments. Structured as a percentage of profits above a hurdle rate — most commonly 20% — it aligns GP and LP incentives while creating significant wealth for successful fund managers. Its favorable tax treatment as capital gains remains a subject of ongoing policy debate. For technology professionals, whether as founders, operators, investors, or aspiring fund managers, understanding carried interest is fundamental to navigating the financial architecture that powers the innovation economy.
