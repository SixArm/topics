# Bayes' theorem

Question: What does Bayes' theorem fundamentally allow us to do in probability calculations?

- [ ] Calculate the exact frequency of events in a dataset
- [ ] Update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence
- [ ] Determine the maximum likelihood of independent events
- [ ] Compute the standard deviation of a probability distribution

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence</p>
  <p>Bayes' theorem enables us to incorporate new information (such as test results or observed data) along with prior knowledge (such as disease prevalence) to arrive at an updated probability. This updating mechanism is central to Bayesian inference, Bayesian networks, and decision-making under uncertainty in machine learning and AI applications.</p>
