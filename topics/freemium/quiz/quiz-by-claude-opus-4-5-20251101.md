  <p>Offering a free basic version to attract users, then converting some to paying customers through premium features</p>
  <p>The freemium model works by attracting a large user base with a free product or service, then converting a percentage of those users into paying customers by offering additional features or advanced functionality not available in the free version. This approach allows potential customers to experience value before committing to a purchase, while creating opportunities for revenue through premium upgrades.</p>
