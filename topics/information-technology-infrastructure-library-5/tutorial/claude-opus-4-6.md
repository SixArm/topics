# Information Technology Infrastructure Library 5

## Introduction

Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) version 5, released in February 2026, represents the most significant evolution of the ITIL framework since its inception. ITIL 5 is an AI-native, human-centric framework designed for digital product and service management in an era defined by rapid technological change, artificial intelligence, and heightened expectations around sustainability and experience. It builds on the foundations of ITIL 4 while fundamentally rethinking how organizations create, deliver, and support digital products and services. For technology professionals, ITIL 5 provides authoritative guidance on aligning IT operations with modern business strategy, integrating AI governance, and managing the full lifecycle of digital products.

## Evolution from ITIL 4 to ITIL 5

ITIL has undergone several major revisions since its origins in the 1980s as a set of UK government best practices for IT service management. Each version reflected the dominant technology paradigm of its time. ITIL 4, released in 2019, introduced the Service Value System and shifted the framework toward value co-creation, Agile, Lean, and DevOps alignment. ITIL 5 takes this further by embedding AI governance at its core, introducing a unified digital product lifecycle, and placing customer and employee experience at the center of all guidance.

| Aspect | ITIL 4 | ITIL 5 |
|---|---|---|
| Core paradigm | Service Value System | Unified Digital Product Lifecycle |
| AI integration | Not addressed directly | AI-native guidance and governance embedded throughout |
| Experience management | Implied through value co-creation | Explicit "ITIL Experience" discipline for users and employees |
| Lifecycle model | Service Value Chain (six activities) | Eight-stage product lifecycle: Discover through Support |
| Operating model alignment | Introduced Agile, Lean, DevOps concepts | Deepened alignment with DevOps, Agile, Lean, and value streams |
| Sustainability | Not a primary concern | Integrated sustainability and ethical considerations |
| Certification path | Foundation, Managing Professional, Strategic Leader | Foundation (v5) launched February 2026; parallel with ITIL 4 for 12+ months |

## Unified Digital Product Lifecycle

One of the defining changes in ITIL 5 is the replacement of fragmented service management approaches with a cohesive, end-to-end digital product lifecycle. This lifecycle reflects how modern organizations actually build and operate digital products, moving away from siloed IT processes toward integrated value delivery. The eight stages are:

- **Discover**: Identifying opportunities, understanding user needs, and validating ideas through research and experimentation.
- **Design**: Translating validated ideas into detailed product designs that account for technical feasibility, user experience, and business viability.
- **Acquire**: Sourcing components, platforms, and capabilities required to build the product, including vendor management and procurement.
- **Build**: Developing, configuring, and assembling the product using engineering practices aligned with Agile and DevOps principles.
- **Transition**: Moving the product from development into production environments, including testing, validation, and change enablement.
- **Operate**: Running and maintaining the product in its live environment, ensuring reliability, performance, and availability.
- **Deliver**: Ensuring the product reaches users effectively and that value is realized through adoption and engagement.
- **Support**: Providing ongoing assistance, incident resolution, and continuous improvement based on user feedback and operational data.

This lifecycle is not strictly linear. Organizations are expected to iterate, loop back, and run stages concurrently as needed, reflecting the reality of continuous delivery and product thinking in modern IT.

## AI-Native Guidance and Governance

ITIL 5 is the first major IT management framework to embed AI readiness across all of its guidance. This is not a bolt-on module but a fundamental design principle. The framework provides specific, actionable guidance on:

- **AI risk management**: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with deploying AI in products and operations, including bias, data quality, and model drift.
- **Ethical AI adoption**: Establishing governance structures and policies that ensure AI is used responsibly, transparently, and in alignment with organizational values and regulatory requirements.
- **AI-enabled service management**: Leveraging AI to automate and augment IT operations, including intelligent incident management, predictive analytics for capacity planning, and AI-driven decision support.
- **Workforce readiness**: Preparing teams and individuals for working alongside AI, including reskilling, role evolution, and managing the human impact of automation.

For technology professionals, this means ITIL 5 provides a structured approach to the governance challenges that many organizations are grappling with as they scale AI adoption across their operations.

## Customer and Employee Experience Focus

ITIL 5 introduces "ITIL Experience" as a formal discipline within the framework, elevating user and employee experience from an implicit outcome to a core value driver. This reflects the growing recognition that technology professionals must think beyond uptime and SLAs to consider the holistic experience of everyone who interacts with IT products and services.

Key elements of the experience focus include:

- **Experience measurement**: Defining and tracking experience-level metrics alongside traditional operational KPIs, such as user satisfaction scores, effort scores, and journey completion rates.
- **Experience design**: Applying design thinking and user research methods within IT service management to proactively shape how users interact with products and support channels.
- **Employee experience**: Recognizing that the experience of IT staff and practitioners directly impacts service quality, retention, and organizational capability.
- **Value co-creation**: Deepening the ITIL 4 concept of value co-creation by making experience a measurable, manageable output of every lifecycle stage.

## Alignment with Modern Operating Models

ITIL 5 strengthens its alignment with the operating models that technology organizations have broadly adopted. Rather than positioning itself as a competing methodology, ITIL 5 explicitly integrates with and complements:

- **DevOps**: ITIL 5 embraces continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code as standard practices within its lifecycle stages.
- **Agile**: The framework supports iterative development, cross-functional teams, and adaptive planning as first-class approaches to product delivery.
- **Lean**: Lean principles of waste elimination, flow optimization, and continuous improvement are woven into ITIL 5's value stream orientation.
- **Value streams**: ITIL 5 shifts the focus from managing individual IT processes to managing end-to-end value streams that deliver outcomes to customers and the business.

This alignment means that technology professionals do not need to choose between ITIL and their existing ways of working. Instead, ITIL 5 provides a governance and management layer that enhances and connects these practices.

## Certification Transition

The ITIL 5 certification path launched with ITIL Foundation (Version 5) on February 12, 2026. ITIL 4 and ITIL 5 certifications will run in parallel for at least 12 months, giving professionals and organizations time to transition. Key considerations for the certification transition include:

- Existing ITIL 4 certifications remain valid and recognized during the parallel period.
- ITIL 5 Foundation covers the new lifecycle model, AI governance, and experience management concepts.
- Transition paths from ITIL 4 to ITIL 5 certifications are expected to be defined as the higher-level ITIL 5 modules are released.
- Organizations should plan their training investments around business readiness rather than rushing to adopt the new certification.

## Summary

ITIL 5 marks a decisive shift in IT service and product management, moving from process-centric service management to a unified, AI-native, experience-driven digital product lifecycle. It provides technology professionals with an authoritative framework for governing AI adoption, managing end-to-end value streams, and placing customer and employee experience at the center of IT operations. By aligning with DevOps, Agile, and Lean rather than competing with them, ITIL 5 positions itself as a governance and management complement to the practices modern organizations already use, making it a practical and forward-looking foundation for technology leadership.
