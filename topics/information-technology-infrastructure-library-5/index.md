# Information Technology Infrastructure Library 5

Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) version 5 (release February 2026) is a modern, AI-native, and human-centric framework designed for digital
product and service management. It evolves ITIL 4 to address rapid technological
changes, integrating AI governance, sustainability, and a unified
product-centric lifecycle. It emphasizes value co-creation, enhanced
customer/employee experience, and increased adaptability in fast-paced
environments.

Key Aspects of ITIL version 5:

- **Unified Digital Product Lifecycle**: Replaces fragmented approaches with a cohesive flow: Discover, Design, Acquire, Build, Transition, Operate, Deliver, and Support.
- **AI-Native Guidance & Governance**: Embeds AI readiness across all, offering specific guidance on managing AI risks and ethical adoption.
- **Customer & Employee Experience Focus**: Introduces "ITIL Experience" to manage user experience as a core value driver.
- **Strengthened Structure**: Aligns with modern operating models like DevOps, Agile, and Lean, focusing on value streams rather than just IT processes.
- **Certification Transition**: ITIL Foundation (Version 5) launches February 12, 2026; ITIL 4 and ITIL 5 will run in parallel for at least 12 months.
