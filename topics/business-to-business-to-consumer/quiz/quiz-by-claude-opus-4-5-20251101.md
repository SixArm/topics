  <p>A company sells products to another business, which then sells those products to consumers</p>
  <p>B2B2C (Business-to-Business-to-Consumer) involves a company selling its products or services to other businesses (the B2B component), which in turn sell those same products or services to end consumers (the B2C component). This model enables companies to reach a larger customer base by leveraging partnerships, such as a software company bundling its application with a hardware manufacturer's product, or businesses selling through an e-commerce platform that provides infrastructure and broader market exposure.</p>
