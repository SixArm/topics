# Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)

Question: How is Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) calculated?

- [ ] Multiplying total uptime by the number of successful operations
- [ ] Dividing the total downtime by the number of failures
- [ ] Adding mean time between failures to total repair hours
- [ ] Subtracting the number of failures from total operational hours

  <p>Dividing the total downtime by the number of failures</p>
  <p>MTTR is calculated by dividing the total downtime by the number of failures during a given period. For example, if a system has been down for 8 hours due to 2 failures, the MTTR would be 4 hours (8 hours / 2 failures = 4 hours). This metric helps organizations evaluate how quickly and efficiently they can restore failed systems to normal operating conditions.</p>
