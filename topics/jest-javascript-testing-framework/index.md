# Jest JavaScript testing framework

Jest is JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook that has become a popular choice for testing JavaScript applications, such as those written with React, Vue, Angular, and Node.

One of Jest's primary strengths is its zero-configuration approach, allowing developers to start testing immediately without extensive setup. It comes with built-in test runners, assertion libraries, mocking capabilities, and code coverage reporting, eliminating the need to configure multiple testing tools. Jest automatically finds test files, runs them in parallel for faster execution, and provides detailed feedback about test results.

The framework offers snapshot testing, which captures component output and compares it against stored snapshots to detect unexpected changes. Its mocking system allows developers to easily mock modules, functions, and API calls, making it simple to isolate code under test. Jest provides matchers for assertions, enabling clear and readable test code.

Jest supports both synchronous and asynchronous testing patterns, including promises and async/await syntax.

Jest's watch mode automatically re-runs tests when files change, providing instant feedback during development. The framework generates code coverage reports, clear error messages, and detailed stack traces, all to make debugging easier.
