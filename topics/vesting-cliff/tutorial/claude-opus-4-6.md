# Vesting cliff

A vesting cliff is a provision in employee equity compensation plans that establishes a minimum period of service before any ownership rights begin to accrue. Common in stock option and restricted stock unit (RSU) agreements, the cliff acts as a gating mechanism: an employee must remain with the company for a specified duration, typically one year, before any equity vests at all. If the employee departs before the cliff date, they forfeit the entire grant. Once the cliff is reached, a lump portion of the grant vests immediately, and the remainder vests incrementally on a regular schedule. The vesting cliff is one of the most important terms a technology professional will encounter when evaluating a compensation package at a startup or publicly traded company.

## How Vesting Cliffs Work

When a company grants equity to an employee, the grant is rarely given outright. Instead, the equity is subject to a vesting schedule that determines when the employee earns ownership over time. The vesting cliff is the initial waiting period within that schedule.

Consider a standard four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff. An employee granted 4,000 shares would vest zero shares during the first twelve months. On the one-year anniversary, 1,000 shares (25% of the total grant) vest all at once. After the cliff, the remaining 3,000 shares vest incrementally, usually monthly or quarterly, over the next three years.

The cliff creates a binary outcome during the initial period: the employee either stays long enough to earn the first tranche of equity, or they leave and receive nothing from that grant. This structure aligns the interests of the company and the employee around a meaningful initial commitment.

## Common Vesting Schedules

Different companies and contexts use different vesting structures. The following table compares the most common arrangements seen in the technology industry.

| Schedule Type | Cliff Period | Total Vesting Period | Post-Cliff Frequency | Typical Context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard 4-year / 1-year cliff | 1 year | 4 years | Monthly | Startups, most tech companies |
| 4-year / 6-month cliff | 6 months | 4 years | Monthly | Early-stage startups competing for talent |
| 3-year / 1-year cliff | 1 year | 3 years | Quarterly | Some public companies |
| No cliff, 4-year monthly | None | 4 years | Monthly | Senior hires, retention grants |
| Back-loaded (e.g., Amazon) | 1 year | 4 years | Annual, increasing percentages | Large public companies |

The four-year schedule with a one-year cliff remains the industry default for initial grants, though companies increasingly vary these terms to attract competitive candidates or to structure retention packages.

## Why Companies Use Vesting Cliffs

Companies implement vesting cliffs for several strategic reasons:

- **Retention incentive.** The cliff discourages short-tenure employment. An employee who might otherwise leave after a few months has a concrete financial reason to stay through the cliff date.
- **Hiring risk mitigation.** Not every hire works out. The cliff protects the company's cap table by ensuring that employees who depart quickly do not retain equity.
- **Alignment with performance evaluation.** A one-year cliff often coincides with the first formal performance review cycle, giving the company an opportunity to assess fit before equity begins to vest.
- **Cap table management.** By preventing equity fragmentation from short-tenured employees, cliffs help keep the capitalization table clean, which matters for future fundraising and due diligence.
- **Cultural signal.** The cliff communicates that the company values long-term commitment over short-term participation.

## What Happens at the Cliff Date

When the cliff date arrives, several things occur simultaneously:

- The first tranche of equity vests, typically 25% of the total grant under a standard four-year schedule.
- The employee now holds vested shares (or options that can be exercised for shares), which they retain even if they leave the company.
- Post-cliff vesting begins on the regular incremental schedule, usually calculated on a monthly basis.
- For stock options, the employee gains the right to exercise the vested portion at the strike price specified in the option agreement.
- For RSUs, the vested units convert to actual shares, which may trigger a tax event.

## Departure Scenarios

The timing of an employee's departure relative to the cliff determines equity outcomes significantly.

| Departure Timing | Equity Outcome | Key Consideration |
|---|---|---|
| Before the cliff | All unvested equity is forfeited | No ownership retained from the grant |
| On the cliff date | Cliff tranche vests (typically 25%) | Employee retains vested portion |
| After the cliff, mid-schedule | Cliff tranche plus any monthly/quarterly increments vest | Unvested remainder is forfeited |
| After full vesting | 100% of the grant is owned | No forfeiture risk remains |
| Termination for cause | Varies by agreement | Some agreements claw back even vested shares |

For stock options specifically, departure also triggers an exercise window. Most option agreements give departing employees 90 days to exercise vested options, though some companies offer extended exercise windows of up to 10 years.

## Negotiation Considerations for Technology Professionals

Equity compensation terms are often negotiable, especially for senior or in-demand candidates. Key areas to evaluate and potentially negotiate include:

- **Cliff length.** A six-month cliff or no cliff at all may be available for senior hires or candidates with competing offers.
- **Acceleration clauses.** Single-trigger acceleration vests some or all equity upon a change of control (acquisition). Double-trigger acceleration requires both a change of control and termination of employment.
- **Extended exercise windows.** Negotiating a longer post-departure exercise window (beyond the standard 90 days) protects the employee from having to make a large financial decision under time pressure.
- **Refresh grants.** Ongoing equity grants issued after the initial grant can reset the retention incentive and may carry different cliff terms.
- **Early exercise.** Some companies allow employees to exercise options before they vest (early exercise or Section 83(b) election), which can have significant tax advantages.

## Tax Implications

Vesting events often create taxable income, and the tax treatment depends on the type of equity instrument.

- **Incentive Stock Options (ISOs).** No regular income tax at vesting or exercise, but the spread may be subject to Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Favorable long-term capital gains treatment is available if holding period requirements are met.
- **Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs).** The spread between the exercise price and fair market value at exercise is taxed as ordinary income.
- **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).** The fair market value of shares at vesting is taxed as ordinary income. There is no Section 83(b) election available for RSUs.
- **Restricted Stock with 83(b) election.** Filing an 83(b) election within 30 days of grant allows the employee to pay tax on the value at grant rather than at vesting, potentially reducing total tax liability if the stock appreciates.

Technology professionals should consult a tax advisor familiar with equity compensation before making exercise or election decisions, as the financial stakes can be substantial.

## Summary

The vesting cliff is a foundational element of equity compensation in the technology industry. It establishes a minimum commitment period, typically one year, before any equity ownership begins. By creating a clear threshold for participation in a company's upside, the cliff protects the company from cap table fragmentation while giving employees a concrete milestone to work toward. Understanding cliff mechanics, departure implications, negotiation levers, and tax consequences equips technology professionals to make informed decisions about their total compensation and career moves.
