  <p>They typically forfeit any unvested stock options or RSUs</p>
  <p>The vesting cliff is designed to encourage employee retention. If an employee leaves before reaching the cliff (typically one year), they lose their unvested equity compensation entirely. This mechanism helps companies ensure that equity is awarded to employees committed to the company's long-term success, while also reducing early turnover.</p>
