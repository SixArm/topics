  <p>Approximately 33%</p>
  <p>The investor's ownership percentage is calculated by dividing their investment by the post-money valuation. The post-money valuation equals the pre-money valuation plus the investment ($10 million + $5 million = $15 million). Therefore, the investor owns $5 million ÷ $15 million = 1/3, which is approximately 33%.</p>
