  <p>They fundamentally alter existing markets or business models, often displacing established companies</p>
  <p>Disruptive technology refers to an innovation that significantly alters or disrupts existing markets, industries, or business models. Unlike incremental improvements, disruptive technologies introduce substantial shifts in how things are done—such as personal computers displacing mainframes, digital photography displacing film, or streaming services displacing video rentals. Notably, disruptive technologies may initially offer lower performance compared to established solutions, but they improve rapidly over time to eventually exceed them.</p>
