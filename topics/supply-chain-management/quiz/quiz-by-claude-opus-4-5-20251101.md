  <p>Designing, planning, executing, controlling, and monitoring the flow of goods, services, and information from suppliers to customers</p>
  <p>Supply chain management encompasses the entire end-to-end process of managing the flow of goods, services, and information—from sourcing raw materials through manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, distribution, and customer service. It's not limited to a single aspect like inventory, transportation, or supplier relationships, but rather integrates all these components to optimize the complete supply chain.</p>
