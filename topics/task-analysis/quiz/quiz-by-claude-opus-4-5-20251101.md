  <p>To break down complex tasks into smaller steps to identify bottlenecks, errors, or inefficiencies</p>
  <p>Task analysis is a systematic method for decomposing complex tasks into manageable steps. By breaking down activities into discrete, meaningful actions and documenting their sequence and dependencies, analysts can identify potential bottlenecks, errors, or inefficiencies in processes. This understanding enables optimization through redesigns, training improvements, or automation—making it a foundational technique in UX design, process engineering, and workflow improvement.</p>
