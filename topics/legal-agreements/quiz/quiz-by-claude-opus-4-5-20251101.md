  <p>Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)</p>
  <p>A Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is specifically designed to prohibit parties from disclosing confidential information to others. For technology professionals, NDAs are critical when sharing proprietary code, product roadmaps, customer data, or trade secrets with potential partners, employees, or contractors. Unlike general contracts that establish transaction terms, or operating agreements that govern business collaboration, NDAs focus exclusively on protecting sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure.</p>
