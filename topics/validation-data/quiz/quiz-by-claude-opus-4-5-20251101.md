# Validation data

Question: What is the primary purpose of using validation data in machine learning?

- [ ] To increase the size of the training dataset for better accuracy
- [ ] To replace the test data after final model deployment
- [ ] To prevent overfitting by evaluating model performance on unseen data during training
- [ ] To store the final predictions made by the trained model

  <p>To prevent overfitting by evaluating model performance on unseen data during training</p>
  <p>Validation data serves as an intermediate evaluation step between training and testing. By setting aside a portion of data that the model doesn't see during training, practitioners can monitor how well the model generalizes to new data, tune hyperparameters, and detect overfitting—when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.</p>
