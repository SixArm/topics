  <p>An exclusive license grants rights to only one licensee, while a non-exclusive license allows multiple licensees to use the same intellectual property</p>
  <p>In a licensing agreement, exclusivity determines how many parties can use the licensed technology, product, or service. An exclusive license gives one licensee the sole right to use the intellectual property, preventing the licensor from granting the same rights to others. A non-exclusive license allows the licensor to grant the same usage rights to multiple licensees simultaneously. This distinction significantly impacts business strategy, pricing, and competitive advantage.</p>
