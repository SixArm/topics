## Convertible Note: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

## What Is a Convertible Note?

A convertible note is a short-term debt instrument that automatically converts into equity upon a triggering event, typically a future financing round. Rather than receiving repayment in cash, investors receive shares in the company at a predetermined or discounted rate.

Convertible notes serve as a bridge between initial funding needs and a formal priced equity round. They allow startups to defer the complex and often contentious process of establishing a company valuation until more business traction exists.

## Why Convertible Notes Matter in Tech Startups

For technology professionals—whether founders, early employees, or technical advisors—understanding convertible notes is essential for several reasons:

- **Speed to close**: Convertible notes require less negotiation than priced equity rounds, enabling faster fundraising
- **Deferred valuation**: Early-stage tech companies with unproven products can avoid premature valuation debates
- **Equity implications**: As a technical founder or employee, notes issued today affect your future ownership percentage
- **Investment decisions**: Technical professionals increasingly participate as angel investors in peer startups

## Key Terms and Mechanics

| Term | Definition | Typical Range |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Principal** | The amount of money invested | Varies by round |
| **Interest Rate** | Annual interest accrued on the principal | 2% – 8% |
| **Maturity Date** | Deadline by which the note must convert or be repaid | 18 – 24 months |
| **Discount Rate** | Price reduction investors receive when converting to equity | 10% – 20% |
| **Valuation Cap** | Maximum company valuation used for conversion calculations | Negotiated |

## How Conversion Works

When a qualifying financing event occurs (typically a Series A round), the convertible note converts into equity shares. The conversion price is determined by whichever mechanism provides the investor with more shares:

1. **Discount method**: The investor converts at the new round's price minus the discount percentage
2. **Cap method**: The investor converts as if the company were valued at the cap, regardless of the actual new valuation

**Example scenario:**

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Note principal | $100,000 |
| Discount rate | 20% |
| Valuation cap | $5 million |
| Series A valuation | $10 million |
| Series A price per share | $1.00 |

Using the discount: $1.00 × (1 - 0.20) = $0.80 per share → 125,000 shares

Using the cap: $1.00 × ($5M / $10M) = $0.50 per share → 200,000 shares

The investor receives 200,000 shares because the cap method yields more favorable terms.

## Advantages of Convertible Notes

**For founders:**
- Faster closing timeline with reduced legal complexity
- No immediate board seat obligations
- Valuation negotiation postponed until stronger leverage exists
- Lower upfront legal costs compared to priced rounds

**For investors:**
- Discount and cap mechanisms provide upside protection
- Interest accrual increases effective investment amount
- Earlier entry point into promising companies
- Simpler documentation accelerates deployment of capital

## Disadvantages and Risks

**For founders:**
- Accumulating interest increases total dilution
- Multiple notes with different caps create complex cap table scenarios
- Maturity date pressure if subsequent funding is delayed
- Potential misalignment if company valuation exceeds expectations

**For investors:**
- No immediate equity ownership or voting rights
- Risk of total loss if company fails before conversion
- Potential for uncapped notes to yield minimal ownership in successful companies
- Limited governance influence during note period

## Convertible Notes vs. SAFEs

The Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), created by Y Combinator, has become a popular alternative to convertible notes.

| Feature | Convertible Note | SAFE |
|---------|------------------|------|
| Debt instrument | Yes | No |
| Interest rate | Yes (2-8%) | No |
| Maturity date | Yes (18-24 months) | No |
| Conversion trigger | Qualified financing | Qualified financing |
| Repayment obligation | Possible at maturity | None |
| Legal complexity | Moderate | Lower |

SAFEs eliminate interest accrual and maturity date pressure, making them founder-friendly. However, some investors prefer convertible notes because the debt structure provides additional protections.

## What Happens at Maturity

If a convertible note reaches its maturity date without a triggering conversion event, several outcomes are possible:

- **Extension**: Parties agree to extend the maturity date, often with modified terms
- **Conversion**: Note converts at a predetermined valuation floor or negotiated terms
- **Repayment**: Investor demands repayment of principal plus accrued interest
- **Default**: Company cannot repay, potentially triggering bankruptcy proceedings

Most angel investors and early-stage venture investors avoid demanding repayment, as forcing a startup into default rarely recovers capital.

## Practical Considerations for Tech Professionals

**As a founder:**
- Keep meticulous records of all notes issued, including terms and holders
- Model dilution scenarios before agreeing to caps and discounts
- Communicate transparently with note holders about company progress
- Build buffer time before maturity dates when planning fundraising timelines

**As a technical employee:**
- Understand how outstanding notes affect your equity stake at conversion
- Factor potential dilution into compensation negotiations
- Ask about the company's cap table during due diligence before joining

**As an angel investor:**
- Negotiate for reasonable caps that protect against runaway valuations
- Ensure discount rates compensate for the risk of early-stage investment
- Review conversion mechanics and triggering events carefully
- Understand your position relative to other note holders

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Stacking uncapped notes**: Multiple uncapped notes can create severe founder dilution in a hot round
- **Ignoring interest accrual**: Small interest rates compound over time and increase conversion amounts
- **Misunderstanding cap mechanics**: A lower cap favors investors, not founders
- **Overlooking pro-rata rights**: Some notes include rights to invest in future rounds—track these carefully
- **Delaying cap table modeling**: Surprises at conversion create conflict and erode trust

## Summary

Convertible notes remain a fundamental instrument in startup financing, balancing speed and simplicity against deferred complexity. For technology professionals navigating the startup ecosystem—whether raising capital, evaluating job offers, or making angel investments—mastery of convertible note mechanics provides a significant advantage in making informed decisions about equity and ownership.
