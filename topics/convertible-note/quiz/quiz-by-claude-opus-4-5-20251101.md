  <p>It allows startups to raise capital without having to agree on a valuation</p>
  <p>Convertible notes are popular among startups because valuation can be difficult to determine in the early stages. The note starts as debt and converts to equity later when a triggering event (such as a future funding round) establishes a clearer valuation, deferring this often contentious negotiation.</p>
