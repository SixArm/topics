# Convertible note

A convertible note is a type of short-term debt financing commonly used by early-stage startups to raise capital from investors. It functions as a loan that automatically converts into equity — typically preferred stock — when a qualifying event occurs, such as a subsequent funding round. Convertible notes allow founders and investors to defer the complex and often contentious process of establishing a company valuation, making them one of the most popular instruments for seed-stage fundraising in the technology industry.

## How Convertible Notes Work

When an investor provides funding through a convertible note, they are lending money to the startup with the expectation that the principal and accrued interest will convert into equity shares at a future date. The conversion is usually triggered by a priced equity financing round, often called a Series A. At that point, the note holder receives shares at a price determined by the terms of the note, which typically include a discount rate and a valuation cap to reward the early investor for taking on greater risk.

If no qualifying event occurs before the maturity date, the startup must either repay the debt, renegotiate terms, or convert the note into equity under predefined fallback provisions. This flexibility makes convertible notes attractive for both parties during the uncertain early stages of a company.

## Key Terms and Features

Understanding the core terms of a convertible note is essential for any technology professional involved in startup financing.

| Term | Description | Typical Range |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Principal | The amount of money invested by the note holder | Varies by deal |
| Interest Rate | Annual interest that accrues on the principal and converts alongside it | 2% to 8% |
| Maturity Date | The deadline by which the note must convert or be repaid | 18 to 24 months |
| Discount Rate | A percentage reduction on the share price at conversion, rewarding early risk | 10% to 20% |
| Valuation Cap | The maximum company valuation at which the note converts into equity | Negotiated per deal |
| Qualifying Event | The trigger that causes automatic conversion, usually a priced round above a threshold | Defined in the note |

## Discount Rate and Valuation Cap

The discount rate and valuation cap are the two most important economic terms in a convertible note, and they can interact in ways that significantly affect outcomes for both founders and investors.

- **Discount rate** gives the note holder the right to convert at a lower price per share than what new investors pay in the qualifying round. For example, a 20% discount means the note holder pays 80 cents for every dollar of share price that Series A investors pay.

- **Valuation cap** sets a ceiling on the effective valuation used for conversion. If the company's valuation at the time of the qualifying round exceeds the cap, the note holder converts at the capped valuation, resulting in more shares and a lower effective price per share.

- **Interaction of both terms**: When a note includes both a discount and a cap, the investor typically receives whichever term produces the lower conversion price — meaning more equity. This is standard practice and is a key point of negotiation.

## Advantages of Convertible Notes

Convertible notes offer several benefits that make them well-suited to early-stage startup financing:

- **Speed and simplicity**: Convertible notes involve less legal complexity than a priced equity round. Documentation is shorter, legal fees are lower, and deals can close in days rather than weeks.

- **Deferred valuation**: Founders avoid setting a formal valuation before the company has meaningful traction, reducing the risk of either overvaluing or undervaluing the business.

- **Investor incentive**: The discount and cap reward early investors for taking on higher risk, aligning their interests with the company's growth.

- **Flexibility**: Terms can be customized to suit different deal structures, investor expectations, and company stages.

- **Minimal dilution at signing**: Because conversion happens later, founders do not immediately give up equity or board seats at the time of the note issuance.

## Disadvantages and Risks

Despite their popularity, convertible notes carry risks and drawbacks that technology professionals should understand:

- **Debt obligation**: A convertible note is legally a debt instrument. If the startup fails to raise a qualifying round before maturity, it may face repayment obligations it cannot meet, potentially triggering insolvency.

- **Stacking and dilution surprises**: Multiple convertible notes issued over time can "stack," leading to significant dilution for founders when all notes convert simultaneously in a future round. This dilution is often underestimated.

- **Misaligned incentives at maturity**: If a note approaches maturity without a qualifying event, founders and investors may disagree on whether to extend, convert, or repay, creating tension.

- **Legal and administrative costs**: While simpler than a priced round, convertible notes still involve legal fees, cap table management, and compliance requirements that add overhead.

- **Complexity for founders**: Founders who issue multiple notes with different caps, discounts, and terms may find it difficult to model their cap table and understand their actual ownership position.

## Convertible Notes vs. SAFEs

The Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), introduced by Y Combinator in 2013, is the primary alternative to convertible notes for early-stage financing. Both instruments serve similar purposes but differ in important ways.

| Feature | Convertible Note | SAFE |
|---------|-----------------|------|
| Legal structure | Debt instrument | Equity-like contract (not debt) |
| Interest rate | Yes, accrues over time | No interest |
| Maturity date | Yes, creates repayment deadline | No maturity date |
| Conversion trigger | Qualifying financing round | Qualifying financing round |
| Discount and cap | Commonly included | Commonly included |
| Legal complexity | Moderate | Lower |
| Investor protection | Stronger (debt status in liquidation) | Weaker (no creditor rights) |

SAFEs are generally simpler and more founder-friendly because they eliminate the debt overhang and maturity deadline. However, some investors prefer convertible notes because the debt structure provides greater legal protection in downside scenarios.

## When to Use a Convertible Note

Convertible notes are most appropriate in the following situations:

- **Pre-seed and seed rounds** where the company lacks sufficient data for a credible valuation.
- **Bridge financing** between priced rounds, where a startup needs short-term capital to reach the next milestone.
- **Angel and small institutional rounds** where speed and simplicity are priorities and both parties want to minimize legal costs.
- **Jurisdictions where SAFEs are less common** or where investors prefer the legal protections of a debt instrument.

For later-stage companies with established revenue and valuation benchmarks, a priced equity round is typically more appropriate than a convertible note.

## Summary

A convertible note is a short-term debt instrument that converts into equity upon a qualifying event, most commonly a priced funding round. It enables startups to raise early-stage capital quickly and with lower legal costs by deferring the valuation negotiation. Key terms include the interest rate, maturity date, discount rate, and valuation cap, all of which shape the economics of conversion. While convertible notes offer speed, flexibility, and investor-friendly incentives, they also introduce risks around debt obligations, dilution stacking, and cap table complexity. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for any technology professional involved in startup formation, investment, or financial planning.
