  <p>Outputs are the tangible deliverables of a project, while outcomes are the longer-term changes or benefits resulting from those deliverables</p>
  <p>Outputs are the immediate products, services, or deliverables that result from project activities (e.g., a software application or report). Outcomes are the changes, benefits, or impacts that result from those outputs over time (e.g., improved customer satisfaction or increased revenue). While both are important, outcomes ultimately matter most as they represent the long-term value and impact of a project.</p>
