# Kalman filter

Question: What is the primary purpose of the Kalman filter algorithm?

- [ ] To encrypt data transmissions in noisy communication channels
- [ ] To perform optimal state estimation for systems with uncertain and noisy measurements
- [ ] To compress sensor data for efficient storage and retrieval
- [ ] To generate random noise for testing system robustness

  <p>To perform optimal state estimation for systems with uncertain and noisy measurements</p>
  <p>The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm designed specifically for state estimation and control of systems that have uncertain and noisy measurements or predictions. It combines current measurements with predicted states to produce an optimal estimate of the current state, making it invaluable for applications like navigation, robotics, target tracking, and financial forecasting where sensor data is inherently noisy.</p>
