Question: What is the primary purpose of database sharding?

- [ ] To encrypt sensitive data across multiple storage locations
- [ ] To create backup copies of the database on different servers
- [ ] To distribute data processing load across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability

  <p>To distribute data processing load across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability</p>
  <p>Database sharding is a partitioning technique that breaks down a large database into smaller parts called shards, each stored on separate server instances. The main goal is to distribute the data processing load across multiple servers, which improves both performance (by reducing the amount of data each server needs to search) and scalability (by allowing the system to grow horizontally by adding more shards).</p>
