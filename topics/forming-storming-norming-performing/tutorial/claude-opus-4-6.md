# Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing (FSNP)

Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing (FSNP) is one of the most influential models in organizational psychology for understanding how teams develop over time. Originally proposed by psychologist Bruce Tuckman in 1965, the model describes four sequential stages that groups typically pass through as they mature from a collection of individuals into a high-performing team. For technology professionals---who routinely work in cross-functional squads, project teams, and agile pods---understanding FSNP provides a practical lens for diagnosing team health, anticipating friction, and accelerating the path to productive collaboration.

## Origins and Background

Bruce Tuckman introduced the four-stage model in his 1965 paper "Developmental Sequence in Small Groups," after reviewing over fifty studies on group behavior. In 1977, Tuckman and Mary Ann Jensen added a fifth stage, Adjourning (sometimes called Mourning), to address what happens when a team disbands. The original four stages remain the core of the framework and are the most widely applied in professional settings.

The model was born in the context of therapy groups and training groups, but it quickly found adoption in business, military, education, and technology organizations. Its staying power comes from its simplicity: four memorable words that map to observable team dynamics nearly everyone has experienced firsthand.

## The Four Stages in Detail

### Forming

During Forming, team members come together for the first time. Interactions tend to be polite and guarded. People are orienting themselves: learning names, understanding the team's purpose, and figuring out where they fit. In a technology context, this is the kickoff phase---new sprint teams assembling, a project charter being drafted, or a newly hired engineer joining an existing squad.

Key characteristics of the Forming stage:

- High dependence on the team leader or manager for direction
- Uncertainty about roles, responsibilities, and expectations
- Limited understanding of each other's technical strengths and working styles
- A tendency to avoid conflict and defer to authority
- Excitement mixed with anxiety about the work ahead

The leader's role during Forming is to provide clear structure: define the mission, set expectations, facilitate introductions, and establish initial processes.

### Storming

Storming is the most challenging and most critical stage. As team members grow comfortable enough to express genuine opinions, disagreements surface. Technical debates about architecture, tooling choices, coding standards, and priorities can become heated. Personality clashes and competing visions for the project emerge. Some members may push back against the leader's authority or resist the processes established during Forming.

Key characteristics of the Storming stage:

- Open disagreement about goals, priorities, or technical direction
- Power struggles and competition for influence
- Frustration with other team members' approaches or work habits
- Questioning of leadership decisions and team processes
- Risk of members disengaging or the team fragmenting

Storming is uncomfortable but necessary. Teams that suppress conflict during this phase often carry unresolved tension that undermines performance later. The leader's role is to facilitate healthy debate, mediate conflicts, and help the team channel disagreement into productive decision-making.

### Norming

In the Norming stage, the team finds its rhythm. Members begin to resolve their differences, establish shared norms, and develop mutual respect. Roles become clearer. The team agrees on working agreements---code review practices, communication channels, definition of done, meeting cadences. Trust builds as people see each other deliver reliably.

Key characteristics of the Norming stage:

- Emergence of shared standards, conventions, and team agreements
- Growing trust and willingness to give and receive feedback
- Increased cohesion and a developing sense of team identity
- Members appreciate complementary strengths and compensate for each other's gaps
- Commitment to collective goals over individual agendas

The leader's role shifts from directing to coaching. The team is increasingly self-managing, and the leader focuses on removing obstacles, reinforcing positive norms, and maintaining alignment with organizational goals.

### Performing

Performing is the stage every team aspires to reach. The team operates with high autonomy, shared accountability, and strong mutual trust. Members collaborate fluidly, resolve conflicts quickly, and focus their energy on delivering results. In software teams, this manifests as consistent velocity, high-quality output, effective pair programming, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements without losing momentum.

Key characteristics of the Performing stage:

- High levels of autonomy, motivation, and competence
- Efficient decision-making with minimal friction
- Strong focus on outcomes and continuous improvement
- Ability to onboard new members or absorb changes without regressing
- The leader delegates extensively and focuses on strategic direction

Not all teams reach the Performing stage. Those that do have typically invested significant time in working through Storming and deliberately building the norms that sustain high performance.

## Stage Comparison

The following table summarizes how key team dimensions change across the four stages:

| Dimension | Forming | Storming | Norming | Performing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Trust Level** | Low | Fragile | Growing | High |
| **Conflict** | Avoided | Frequent and open | Managed constructively | Resolved quickly |
| **Communication** | Polite, surface-level | Heated, sometimes unproductive | Open and direct | Efficient and transparent |
| **Leadership Style** | Directive | Coaching and mediating | Facilitative | Delegative |
| **Productivity** | Low | Variable | Increasing | Consistently high |
| **Team Identity** | Absent | Contested | Emerging | Strong and shared |
| **Decision-Making** | Leader-driven | Contentious | Collaborative | Autonomous |

## Common Patterns in Technology Teams

Technology professionals encounter FSNP dynamics in several recurring scenarios:

- **New project teams**: When an organization assembles a cross-functional team for a new product initiative, the team typically enters Forming regardless of how experienced the individuals are.
- **Agile squad rotations**: Companies that periodically rotate engineers between squads trigger a return to Forming each time. This is a deliberate tradeoff between knowledge sharing and team stability.
- **Post-reorg turbulence**: Organizational restructuring forces teams back into early stages. Even renaming a team or changing its charter can trigger Storming as members renegotiate identity and purpose.
- **Remote and distributed teams**: Forming and Storming can take longer in distributed settings because casual interactions that build trust happen less organically. Leaders must be more intentional about creating connection.
- **Open source communities**: Volunteer contributors cycle through stages differently because membership is fluid and authority structures are less formal.

## Practical Strategies by Stage

| Stage | Actions for Leaders | Actions for Team Members |
|---|---|---|
| **Forming** | Define clear goals and roles; facilitate introductions; establish initial working agreements | Ask questions; learn team norms; be open about your skills and preferences |
| **Storming** | Normalize disagreement; mediate conflicts; protect psychological safety | Express opinions respectfully; listen to understand, not to win; stay committed to the team |
| **Norming** | Reinforce positive behaviors; formalize agreements; coach rather than direct | Hold each other accountable; give and accept feedback; contribute to team rituals |
| **Performing** | Delegate authority; focus on strategic alignment; celebrate achievements | Mentor newer members; pursue continuous improvement; maintain discipline in processes |

## The Fifth Stage: Adjourning

Tuckman and Jensen's 1977 addition, Adjourning, addresses the dissolution of a team after its work is complete. In technology organizations, this happens at the end of a project, during a reorganization, or when a product is sunset. Adjourning can involve a sense of loss, especially for high-performing teams. Conducting retrospectives, documenting lessons learned, and acknowledging contributions helps team members transition constructively to their next assignment.

## Limitations and Criticisms

While FSNP is valuable, it has important limitations that technology professionals should keep in mind:

- **Linearity assumption**: The model suggests a sequential progression, but real teams frequently oscillate between stages. A single new hire, a change in leadership, or a shift in project scope can push a Performing team back to Storming.
- **Cultural context**: The model was developed primarily from studies of Western, small-group dynamics. Teams operating across cultures with different norms around hierarchy, conflict, and communication may experience the stages differently.
- **Team size**: FSNP applies most naturally to small teams (roughly 5 to 12 members). Larger groups and scaled frameworks like SAFe involve additional layers of coordination that the model does not address.
- **Overemphasis on stages**: Labeling a team as "stuck in Storming" can become a self-fulfilling prophecy or an excuse to avoid addressing specific, actionable problems.
- **Individual variation**: Not every member experiences the same stage at the same time. One person may still be Forming while others have moved into Norming.

The model is best used as a diagnostic heuristic rather than a rigid prescription. It helps teams name what they are experiencing and choose appropriate responses.

## Related

After understanding FSNP, technology professionals benefit from exploring several adjacent topics. **Agile coaching** provides practical techniques for guiding teams through these stages within iterative development frameworks. **Psychological safety**, as researched by Amy Edmondson, explains why Storming can be productive rather than destructive when the right conditions exist. **Servant leadership** describes the leadership philosophy most aligned with helping teams reach Performing. **Team topologies** offer a structural perspective on how to design teams for sustained high performance. **Retrospectives** and **blameless post-mortems** provide concrete rituals that reinforce Norming and sustain Performing. Finally, **conflict resolution** and **communication styles** give team members the interpersonal tools to navigate Storming effectively.

## Summary

Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing is a foundational model for understanding how teams evolve from uncertain beginnings to high-functioning collaboration. For technology professionals who regularly join, lead, or restructure teams, the framework provides a shared vocabulary for diagnosing team dynamics and choosing the right leadership interventions at each stage. The key insight is that conflict during Storming is not a failure---it is a necessary passage toward the trust and shared norms that make Performing possible. By recognizing which stage a team is in and responding with appropriate structure, facilitation, or delegation, leaders and team members alike can shorten the path to sustained, high-quality delivery.
