  <p>Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control</p>
  <p>DMAIC is a structured problem-solving methodology used in Six Sigma. The stages must be followed in order: first Define the problem and goals, then Measure the current process to gather data, next Analyze the data to identify root causes, then Improve the process by implementing solutions, and finally Control to ensure the improvements are sustainable. This sequence ensures that solutions are data-driven and that improvements are maintained over time.</p>
