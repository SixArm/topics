  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Plan, Do, Check, Act</p>
  <p>The PDCA cycle follows a specific sequence: first Plan (define the problem and develop a solution), then Do (implement the plan), then Check (evaluate the results against goals), and finally Act (take action based on results, either standardizing the process or starting a new cycle). This iterative approach, also known as the Deming cycle, enables continuous improvement of processes and products.</p>
