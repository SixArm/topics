  <p>The communication structure of the organization that built it</p>
  <p>Conway's law, proposed by Melvin Conway in 1968, states that "organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations." This means that how teams communicate and collaborate directly influences the architecture of the software they create. For example, siloed teams tend to produce siloed systems lacking integration, while cross-functional teams with open communication tend to create more cohesive, well-integrated systems.</p>
