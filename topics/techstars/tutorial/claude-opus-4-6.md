# Techstars

Techstars is one of the most prominent and influential startup accelerator programs in the world. Founded in 2006 in Boulder, Colorado, Techstars provides mentorship, funding, and resources to early-stage companies, helping them refine their products, develop sustainable business models, and scale rapidly. With a portfolio spanning thousands of companies across dozens of cities worldwide, Techstars has become a cornerstone institution in the global startup ecosystem, shaping how entrepreneurs access capital, knowledge, and networks during the critical earliest stages of company building.

## History and Mission

Techstars was co-founded by David Cohen, Brad Feld, David Brown, and Jared Polis with the mission of enabling entrepreneurial success everywhere. The founding team believed that access to mentorship and capital should not be limited by geography, and they designed a repeatable accelerator model that could be deployed in multiple cities around the world. Beginning with a single program in Boulder, Techstars expanded rapidly during the late 2000s and 2010s into major markets including New York, London, Berlin, Tel Aviv, Austin, and many others. Over the years, it has operated more than 50 accelerator programs globally, often in partnership with major corporations that sponsor industry-specific tracks.

## How the Accelerator Program Works

The core Techstars accelerator program runs for approximately 13 weeks and follows a structured three-phase approach.

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Mentorship-Driven | Weeks 1–4 | Startups meet with over 100 mentors to identify key challenges, validate assumptions, and refine their vision. |
| Heads-Down Building | Weeks 5–9 | Teams focus intensively on product development, customer acquisition, and business model iteration based on mentor feedback. |
| Demo Day Preparation | Weeks 10–13 | Startups polish their pitch, develop investor materials, and present at Demo Day to hundreds of investors and stakeholders. |

Each participating startup receives seed funding (typically a convertible note of $120,000) along with access to office space, legal and accounting services, cloud hosting credits, and Techstars' extensive alumni and investor network. In exchange, Techstars takes a small equity stake, generally around 6% common stock.

## Selection Process and Acceptance Rates

Techstars is highly selective. Each program cohort typically accepts 10 to 12 startups from thousands of applications, resulting in acceptance rates often below 1%. The selection criteria emphasize:

- **Team quality**: Founders with complementary skills, domain expertise, and demonstrated resilience.
- **Market opportunity**: Large addressable markets with clear demand signals.
- **Product traction**: Evidence of early customers, revenue, or meaningful user engagement.
- **Coachability**: Willingness to receive and act on critical feedback from mentors and peers.

The application process includes a written application, video interviews, and in-person meetings with managing directors before final selection.
