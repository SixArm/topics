# State machine

Question: What is the key difference between a deterministic and a non-deterministic finite-state machine?

- [ ] Deterministic machines can only have a single state, while non-deterministic machines can have multiple states
- [ ] Non-deterministic machines require more memory to operate than deterministic machines
- [ ] In a deterministic machine, the next state is uniquely determined by the current state and input, while in a non-deterministic machine there may be multiple possible next states for a given input
- [ ] Deterministic machines cannot be represented as state diagrams, while non-deterministic machines can

  <p>In a deterministic machine, the next state is uniquely determined by the current state and input, while in a non-deterministic machine there may be multiple possible next states for a given input</p>
  <p>In deterministic state machines, the behavior of the system is completely determined by its current state and the input event, meaning there is exactly one possible transition for each state-input pair. In non-deterministic state machines, the same current state and input may lead to multiple possible next states, introducing ambiguity in the system's behavior.</p>
