# Accuracy

Question: How is accuracy calculated in model performance evaluation?

- [ ] TP / (TP + FP)
- [ ] (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)
- [ ] TP / (TP + FN)
- [ ] TN / (TN + FP)

  <p>(TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)</p>
  <p>Accuracy measures how often the model predicts correctly by dividing the total number of correct predictions (true positives plus true negatives) by the total number of all predictions (true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives).</p>
