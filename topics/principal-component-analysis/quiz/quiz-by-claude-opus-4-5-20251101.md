# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Question: What is the primary purpose of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in machine learning?

- [ ] To increase the number of features in a dataset for more detailed analysis
- [ ] To transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving variance
- [ ] To classify data points into predefined categories
- [ ] To generate synthetic data samples for training models

  <p>To transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving variance</p>
  <p>PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that identifies principal components (orthogonal axes) along which the data varies the most. By projecting data onto these components, PCA reduces the number of dimensions while retaining as much of the original variance as possible. This makes it useful for simplifying complex datasets, visualization, noise reduction, and feature transformation.</p>
