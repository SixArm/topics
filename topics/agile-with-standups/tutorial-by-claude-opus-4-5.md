# Agile with Standups: Tutorial

## Overview

Daily standups are brief synchronization meetings designed to keep agile team members aligned and focused on their goals. Typically held at the same time each day and lasting no more than 15 minutes, standups bring together all team members to share updates and identify potential roadblocks before they become major issues. When executed properly, standups foster transparency, accountability, and team cohesion, serving as a lightweight mechanism for coordination that replaces heavier status-reporting processes.

For change technology professionals, mastering the standup is essential because it is often the most visible and frequent agile ceremony. Done well, it energizes teams and accelerates problem resolution. Done poorly, it becomes a dreaded daily ritual that wastes time and damages morale.

## Key Concepts

### The Three Questions

During a standup, each team member typically addresses three key questions:

1. **What did I accomplish yesterday?** This provides visibility into progress and helps the team understand what has been completed.
2. **What do I plan to work on today?** This helps the team identify dependencies and coordinate efforts.
3. **What obstacles or impediments am I facing?** This surfaces blockers early so they can be resolved quickly, often by the Scrum Master or other team members.

The emphasis is on communication rather than detailed problem-solving. Complex discussions are deferred to separate meetings with the relevant people.

### Physical Setup and Format

- **Standing format:** The meeting is traditionally held with participants standing in a circle, which naturally encourages shorter contributions and maintains energy levels. Standing discourages settling in for long discussions.
- **Near the task board:** Many teams conduct standups near their physical task board or a screen displaying their digital project management tool, allowing for visual reference to current work items and sprint progress.
- **Remote adaptation:** Distributed teams achieve similar benefits through video conferencing platforms with screen sharing and collaborative viewing of project boards. Cameras on is generally encouraged to maintain engagement and connection.

### Who Participates

The standup is for the development team. It is a peer-to-peer synchronization meeting, not a status report to management. The Scrum Master facilitates and helps remove impediments. The Product Owner may attend to stay informed, but the meeting belongs to the team.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Set a Consistent Time and Place:** Choose a time that works for all team members and hold the standup at the same time every day. Consistency builds habit and ensures attendance. For distributed teams, find a time that is reasonable across time zones.

2. **Enforce the 15-Minute Time Box:** Use a timer visible to all participants. When 15 minutes are up, the standup ends. If topics need further discussion, note them and schedule separate follow-up conversations (often called "after-parties" or "parking lot" discussions).

3. **Focus on the Three Questions:** Keep each person's update brief and structured around the three questions. Discourage tangents, technical deep-dives, and problem-solving during the standup itself.

4. **Ensure Equal Participation:** Every team member should speak. The facilitator should gently ensure that quiet members contribute and that dominant voices do not monopolize the time.

5. **Avoid Common Anti-Patterns:**
   - **Status reporting to a manager:** The standup is for the team, not for management oversight. If a manager attends, they should observe, not direct.
   - **Problem-solving during the meeting:** Note blockers and schedule separate discussions.
   - **Lengthy updates:** If someone's update is running long, the facilitator should redirect to keep things moving.
   - **Going through the motions:** If team members are giving rote updates without genuine communication, refresh the format or discuss the purpose of the standup in a retrospective.

6. **Use Visual Aids:** Walk through the task board or sprint board during the standup. This grounds the discussion in actual work items and makes progress visible.

7. **Follow Up on Impediments:** The Scrum Master or facilitator should track impediments raised during standups and actively work to resolve them. If impediments are raised repeatedly without resolution, the standup loses its value.

8. **Adapt the Format as Needed:** Some teams find alternative approaches more effective:
   - Walking the board (discussing items on the board rather than going person-by-person)
   - Focusing only on blockers and dependencies
   - Varying the question format to keep engagement fresh

9. **Evaluate Regularly:** In retrospectives, ask whether the standup is providing value. If the team finds it unhelpful, explore why and make changes. The standup should serve the team, not the other way around.

## Key Takeaway

The daily standup is a lightweight but powerful coordination tool that keeps agile teams synchronized, surfaces problems early, and maintains momentum. Its effectiveness depends on discipline, brevity, and a focus on peer-to-peer communication rather than status reporting. For change professionals, the key is to ensure standups remain purposeful -- a genuine coordination mechanism that the team values, not a ritualistic obligation that wastes time. When in doubt, return to the fundamentals: transparency, impediment removal, and team alignment.
