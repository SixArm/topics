# Agile with standups

Agile teams can choose to do daily standups, which are a brief synchronization meeting that keeps team members aligned and focused on sprint goals. Typically held at the same time each day, this 15-minute gathering brings together all team members to share updates and identify potential roadblocks before they become major issues. When executed properly, daily standups foster transparency, accountability, and team cohesion. They help identify dependencies between tasks, surface impediments early, and maintain momentum.

During the standup, each team member addresses three key questions: what they accomplished yesterday, what they plan to work on today, and what obstacles or impediments they're facing. This format ensures everyone stays informed about project progress while maintaining the meeting's brevity and focus. The emphasis is on communication rather than detailed problem-solving, with complex discussions deferred to separate meetings with relevant stakeholders.

The physical setup often involves team members standing in a circle, which naturally encourages shorter contributions and maintains energy levels. Many teams conduct standups near their task board or digital project management tools, allowing for visual reference to current work items and sprint progress. Remote teams can achieve similar benefits through video conferencing platforms that enable screen sharing and collaborative viewing of project boards.

Effective standups require discipline and structure to avoid common pitfalls like lengthy discussions, status reporting to management, or solving complex technical problems. The Scrum Master or facilitator plays a crucial role in keeping conversations on track and ensuring equal participation from all team members.
