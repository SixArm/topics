- [ ] What accomplished yesterday, what you plan to work on today, and what obstacles you're facing

  <p>What accomplished yesterday, what you plan to work on today, and what obstacles you're facing</p>
  <p>The three key questions format ensures everyone stays informed about project progress while maintaining the meeting's brevity and focus. This structure emphasizes communication rather than detailed problem-solving, with complex discussions deferred to separate meetings with relevant stakeholders.</p>
