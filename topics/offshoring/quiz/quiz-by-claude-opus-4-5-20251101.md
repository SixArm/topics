  <p>Cost savings through lower labor costs in other countries</p>
  <p>The primary benefit of offshoring is cost savings. Companies can often save a significant amount of money by outsourcing work to countries with lower labor costs. While offshoring also provides access to specialized skills and 24/7 operations, cost reduction remains the most common driver for offshoring decisions.</p>
