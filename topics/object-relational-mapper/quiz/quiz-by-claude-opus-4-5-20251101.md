  <p>To provide a higher-level abstraction layer between application code and a relational database, eliminating the need for manual SQL queries</p>
  <p>An ORM allows developers to interact with a relational database using object-oriented programming concepts. It maps classes and objects to database tables and records, provides query interfaces using object-oriented syntax, handles CRUD operations through API methods, and manages data relationships—all without requiring developers to write raw SQL queries.</p>
