# Error detection algorithms

Question: Which error detection algorithm uses polynomial division and is commonly employed in network communication for its ability to detect a wider range of errors than simple checksums?

- [ ] Parity Bits
- [ ] Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
- [ ] Hamming Code
- [ ] Checksum

  <p>Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)</p>
  <p>CRC is a robust error detection technique that uses polynomial division to generate a check value. It is widely used in network protocols (such as Ethernet and USB) because it can detect burst errors and a broader range of error patterns compared to simple checksums or parity bits, making it essential for reliable data transmission.</p>
