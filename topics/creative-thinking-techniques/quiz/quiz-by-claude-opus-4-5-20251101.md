  <p>A series of prompts: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse</p>
  <p>SCAMPER is a creative thinking technique that uses seven action-oriented prompts to systematically generate variations and new ideas. Each letter represents a different way to transform or reconsider an existing concept: Substitute (replace components), Combine (merge ideas), Adapt (adjust for new contexts), Modify (change attributes), Put to another use (repurpose), Eliminate (remove elements), and Reverse (invert or rearrange). This structured approach helps technology professionals break through creative blocks when designing features, improving processes, or solving technical problems.</p>
