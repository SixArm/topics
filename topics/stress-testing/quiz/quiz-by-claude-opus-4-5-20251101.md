# Stress testing

Question: What is the primary objective of stress testing in software testing?

- [ ] To verify that the application's user interface displays correctly across browsers
- [ ] To ensure code follows proper syntax and style guidelines
- [ ] To evaluate system breaking points and recovery capabilities under extreme conditions
- [ ] To validate that individual functions return expected outputs

  <p>To evaluate system breaking points and recovery capabilities under extreme conditions</p>
  <p>Stress testing subjects applications to conditions that exceed normal operational parameters, pushing systems beyond their intended capacity limits by increasing user loads, data volumes, or transaction rates until failure occurs. This reveals how applications behave when resources are insufficient and helps developers understand failure modes to implement appropriate error handling mechanisms.</p>
