  <p>Superficial adoption of agile processes without embracing the underlying philosophy of collaboration and respect for individuals</p>
  <p>Dark agile occurs when organizations adopt agile practices mechanically—such as standups, sprints, and retrospectives—without embracing the core values of collaboration, adaptability, and respect for individuals. This leads to agile ceremonies being weaponized for micromanagement, unrealistic deadlines, and blame assignment, ultimately causing developer burnout, decreased quality, and failed projects. True agile transformation requires cultural change, not just process adoption.</p>
