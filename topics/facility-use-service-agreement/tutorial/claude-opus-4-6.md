# Facility Use/Service Agreement (FUSA)

A Facility Use/Service Agreement (FUSA) is a legally binding contract between a facility owner or service provider and a customer, tenant, or end user. It defines the terms and conditions governing access to physical facilities, infrastructure, or associated services. In the technology industry, FUSAs are foundational to colocation arrangements, data center leasing, shared lab environments, cloud infrastructure hosting, and managed service engagements. Whether you are provisioning server racks in a third-party data center or leasing office space that includes IT infrastructure, the FUSA establishes the rights, obligations, and expectations of every party involved.

## Purpose and Business Context

A FUSA serves as the single source of truth for what is being provided, how it will be delivered, and what happens when things go wrong. For technology professionals, FUSAs frequently arise in scenarios such as:

- Colocation agreements where a company places its own hardware in a provider's data center
- Managed hosting contracts where the provider operates infrastructure on the customer's behalf
- Shared laboratory or testing facility access for hardware validation, RF testing, or prototyping
- Office and campus leases that bundle IT services such as networking, physical security, and power
- Disaster recovery and business continuity site arrangements

The FUSA reduces ambiguity by converting verbal understandings into enforceable contractual language. It protects both parties from disputes over service scope, cost overruns, and liability exposure.

## Key Provisions

### Scope of Use and Services

The scope clause defines exactly what the customer is entitled to use or receive. In a technology context, this includes physical space dimensions, power capacity (measured in kilowatts per rack), cooling specifications, network connectivity (bandwidth, port speeds, cross-connects), and any managed services layered on top. The clause should be precise enough to prevent scope creep and clear enough to serve as the baseline for service level measurement.

### Compensation and Payment Terms

The compensation section covers all financial obligations. Pricing models vary depending on the facility type and engagement structure.

| Pricing Model | Description | Common Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed monthly fee | Flat rate regardless of consumption | Colocation, office leases |
| Usage-based | Charges scale with metered consumption | Cloud infrastructure, power draw |
| Tiered pricing | Rate changes at defined usage thresholds | Bandwidth, storage services |
| Hybrid | Base fee plus variable overage charges | Managed hosting with burst capacity |

Payment terms should specify due dates, accepted methods, currency, late payment penalties, and any escalation procedures for billing disputes.

### Duration, Renewal, and Termination

This provision defines the contract lifecycle. Key elements include:

- **Initial term**: The minimum commitment period, often 12 to 36 months for data center agreements
- **Renewal terms**: Whether the agreement auto-renews, the renewal period length, and any price adjustment mechanisms
- **Termination for convenience**: The notice period required for either party to exit without cause, typically 30 to 90 days
- **Termination for cause**: Conditions that allow immediate or accelerated termination, such as material breach, insolvency, or regulatory action
- **Wind-down obligations**: Requirements for data migration, equipment removal, and transition assistance upon termination

### Responsibilities and Obligations

Both parties carry defined responsibilities. A well-drafted FUSA separates provider obligations from customer obligations to avoid finger-pointing during incidents.

| Party | Typical Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| Provider | Facility maintenance, power and cooling delivery, physical security, fire suppression, environmental monitoring, regulatory compliance |
| Customer | Proper use of allocated space, adherence to facility rules, equipment labeling, cable management, timely payment, authorized personnel management |

For technology deployments, responsibility boundaries should explicitly address who handles network configuration, hardware maintenance, operating system patching, and incident escalation.

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

While sometimes documented separately, SLAs are often embedded within or annexed to the FUSA. They quantify the provider's performance commitments and the remedies available when those commitments are missed.

- **Uptime guarantees**: Expressed as a percentage (e.g., 99.99% availability equates to roughly 52 minutes of permitted downtime per year)
- **Response and resolution times**: Maximum time to acknowledge and resolve incidents, categorized by severity
- **Maintenance windows**: Scheduled periods for planned maintenance that are excluded from uptime calculations
- **Service credits**: Financial remedies, typically a percentage of monthly fees, credited when SLAs are breached

### Liability and Insurance

The liability clause allocates risk between the parties. It typically includes:

- **Limitation of liability**: Caps on total damages, often tied to the fees paid over a defined period (e.g., 12 months of service fees)
- **Exclusion of consequential damages**: Provisions that exclude liability for indirect losses such as lost profits or business interruption
- **Indemnification**: Obligations for one party to hold the other harmless against third-party claims arising from their actions or negligence
- **Insurance requirements**: Minimum coverage amounts for general liability, property, professional liability (errors and omissions), and cyber liability policies

### Intellectual Property and Confidentiality

This section protects sensitive information exchanged during the engagement. For technology professionals, it is particularly important when facility access exposes proprietary hardware designs, network architectures, or operational procedures. Provisions should address:

- Non-disclosure obligations and the definition of confidential information
- Ownership of any intellectual property created during the engagement
- Data handling and destruction requirements upon agreement termination
- Compliance with applicable data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2 requirements

### Dispute Resolution

The dispute resolution clause establishes how disagreements are handled before they escalate to litigation. A typical escalation path includes:

- **Negotiation**: Direct discussion between designated representatives within a defined timeframe
- **Mediation**: Engagement of a neutral third party to facilitate resolution
- **Arbitration**: Binding decision by an arbitrator, often governed by rules from organizations such as the American Arbitration Association or JAMS
- **Jurisdiction and venue**: The governing law and physical location where legal proceedings will occur

## Negotiation Considerations for Technology Professionals

When reviewing or negotiating a FUSA, technology professionals should pay particular attention to several areas that directly affect operational risk:

- **Right to audit**: Ensure the agreement grants the right to inspect the facility and verify compliance with SLAs and security commitments
- **Change management**: Define the process for modifying service scope, pricing, or technical specifications during the contract term
- **Force majeure**: Review what events excuse performance obligations, and whether the clause is appropriately scoped for your risk tolerance
- **Assignment and subcontracting**: Determine whether the provider can assign the agreement or subcontract services to a third party without your consent
- **Data sovereignty**: Confirm that the facility location and any backup or replication sites comply with your data residency requirements
- **Exit planning**: Negotiate transition assistance terms before you sign, not during a contentious termination

## Related

Technology professionals working with FUSAs should also study Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for performance metrics and remedies, Master Service Agreements (MSAs) that provide overarching contract frameworks, Statements of Work (SOWs) that detail specific project-based engagements, Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) for confidentiality protections, Business Continuity Planning (BCP) for disaster recovery site arrangements, and compliance frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA that influence facility requirements and audit obligations.

## Summary

A Facility Use/Service Agreement is the contractual foundation for any engagement involving physical infrastructure, shared facilities, or bundled services. For technology professionals, it governs critical operational concerns including uptime commitments, power and connectivity delivery, security obligations, liability allocation, and intellectual property protection. A well-negotiated FUSA reduces operational risk, provides enforceable remedies when service levels are missed, and establishes clear exit terms that protect the customer's ability to migrate when business needs change. Investing time in understanding and negotiating these agreements is as important as the technical architecture decisions they support.
