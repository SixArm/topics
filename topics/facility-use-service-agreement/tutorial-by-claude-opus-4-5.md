## Facility Use/Service Agreement (FUSA)

A Facility Use/Service Agreement (FUSA) is a legal contract that governs the relationship between a facility owner or service provider and a customer or tenant. For technology professionals, these agreements are encountered when renting data center space, coworking offices, server colocation facilities, or accessing shared technology infrastructure.

The FUSA may also be known as a Facility Use Agreement, Facility Rental Agreement, Service Agreement, or Service Contract depending on the industry and context.

## Why Technology Professionals Need to Understand FUSAs

Technology professionals regularly encounter FUSAs in several contexts:

- **Data center colocation** – Housing servers in third-party facilities
- **Coworking spaces** – Using shared office environments with technology amenities
- **Cloud and hosting services** – Physical facility terms underlying digital services
- **Lab and testing facilities** – Accessing specialized equipment or environments
- **Disaster recovery sites** – Securing backup operational locations

Understanding these agreements protects your organization from unexpected costs, service disruptions, and legal liability.

## Core Provisions of a FUSA

### Scope

The scope section defines exactly what services or facility access you receive. This provision must be clear, precise, and comprehensive.

| Element | What to Specify |
|---------|-----------------|
| Nature of services | Exact facilities, equipment, or services included |
| Extent of access | Physical boundaries, hours of operation, access credentials |
| Frequency | How often services are delivered or access is permitted |
| Duration per use | Time limits on individual sessions or continuous access |
| Quality standards | Service level expectations, environmental conditions |

For technology facilities, scope commonly includes power capacity (measured in kW), cooling specifications, network connectivity, and physical security measures.

### Compensation

This section specifies all financial terms for using the facility or services.

**Fee structures commonly used:**

- **One-time fees** – Setup charges, installation costs, security deposits
- **Periodic fees** – Monthly or annual rent, recurring service charges
- **Variable fees** – Usage-based charges for power consumption, bandwidth, or additional services

**Payment terms to verify:**

- Accepted payment methods
- Invoice timing and due dates
- Grace periods before late penalties apply
- Late payment penalties and interest rates
- Conditions for fee increases or adjustments

### Duration

The duration provision establishes the timeframe of your agreement and exit conditions.

| Term Type | Characteristics |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Fixed term | Set start and end dates; early termination may incur penalties |
| Month-to-month | Flexible but typically requires 30-day notice to terminate |
| Auto-renewal | Automatically extends unless notice is provided by a specified deadline |

Key elements to review:

- Start and end dates of the agreement
- Conditions that allow either party to terminate early
- Required notice periods for termination or non-renewal
- Consequences of termination (data retrieval timelines, deposit returns, equipment removal)

### Responsibilities

This section allocates obligations between the provider and customer.

**Provider responsibilities typically include:**

- Maintaining facility infrastructure
- Providing agreed-upon utilities (power, cooling, connectivity)
- Ensuring physical security
- Performing maintenance with appropriate notice
- Meeting uptime or availability commitments

**Customer responsibilities typically include:**

- Using the facility according to stated purposes
- Complying with facility rules and regulations
- Maintaining insurance as required
- Providing accurate contact information for emergencies
- Paying fees on time
- Removing equipment upon agreement termination

### Liability

Liability provisions determine who bears financial responsibility when problems occur.

**Critical liability elements:**

- **Indemnification** – Which party compensates the other for third-party claims
- **Limitation of liability** – Caps on damages either party can claim
- **Exclusions** – Types of damages excluded (often consequential or indirect damages)
- **Insurance requirements** – Minimum coverage types and amounts required

| Insurance Type | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| General liability | Covers bodily injury and property damage claims |
| Professional liability | Covers errors and omissions in professional services |
| Property insurance | Covers damage to equipment housed in the facility |
| Business interruption | Covers lost income during service outages |

Technology professionals should verify that their equipment and data are adequately covered, as many facility providers limit their liability for customer property.

### Intellectual Property

This provision protects proprietary information and clarifies ownership of created works.

**Key IP considerations:**

- **Non-disclosure obligations** – Protection of confidential information shared between parties
- **Proprietary information** – Handling of trade secrets, customer data, and business processes
- **Created IP ownership** – Who owns work products, improvements, or inventions developed during the agreement
- **Data handling** – How customer data is stored, protected, and returned upon termination

### Dispute Resolution

This section establishes how conflicts between parties will be resolved.

| Method | Description | Advantages |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Negotiation | Direct discussion between parties | Fastest, lowest cost, preserves relationship |
| Mediation | Neutral third party facilitates resolution | Less adversarial than litigation |
| Arbitration | Binding decision by neutral arbitrator | Faster than court, typically confidential |
| Litigation | Resolution through court system | Formal process, appeals available |

Additional dispute elements to verify:

- Governing law (which jurisdiction's laws apply)
- Venue (where disputes will be heard)
- Whether arbitration is binding or non-binding
- Who pays dispute resolution costs

## Negotiation Priorities for Technology Professionals

When reviewing or negotiating a FUSA, prioritize these areas:

1. **Service level commitments** – Ensure uptime guarantees, response times, and remedies for failures are clearly documented
2. **Termination flexibility** – Negotiate reasonable exit terms that allow business agility
3. **Liability caps** – Push for provider accountability proportional to the value of your operations
4. **Data protection** – Clarify data handling, security standards, and breach notification requirements
5. **Force majeure** – Understand what events excuse performance and how they affect your operations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Vague scope definitions** – Ambiguous language leads to disputes over what is included
- **Auto-renewal traps** – Missing cancellation deadlines can lock you into unwanted extensions
- **Uncapped liability exposure** – Ensure your potential liability is bounded and insurable
- **Inadequate termination provisions** – Verify you can exit without excessive penalties if business needs change
- **Missing SLA remedies** – Uptime promises without credits or remedies offer no real protection

## Summary

A Facility Use/Service Agreement is a foundational document that governs access to physical infrastructure and services. Technology professionals must understand each provision to protect their organizations from operational disruptions, financial exposure, and legal disputes. Review these agreements carefully before signing, negotiate unfavorable terms when possible, and maintain documentation of all amendments and communications throughout the relationship.
