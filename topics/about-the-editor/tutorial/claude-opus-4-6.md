# About the editor

This tutorial introduces Joel Parker Henderson, the editor behind this collection of technology and business topics. Understanding who creates and curates educational resources provides valuable context for evaluating the material, recognizing the editorial perspective, and connecting with the broader community of practice. This section offers insight into Joel's professional background, consulting work, open source contributions, and personal values that shape the content you encounter throughout these topics.

## Professional background

Joel Parker Henderson is a software developer, writer, and technology consultant. His career spans work with organizations of all sizes, from venture capital-backed startups to Fortune 500 enterprises to nonprofit organizations. This breadth of experience informs the editorial choices throughout the topics collection, which balances practical hands-on technical guidance with strategic business thinking.

Joel's consulting practice focuses on helping companies leverage both technology capabilities and business capabilities. This dual focus is reflected in the range of topics covered in the collection, which bridges the gap between engineering execution and organizational strategy.

## Technology capabilities

Joel provides a substantial body of open source resources aimed at helping developers improve their craft and adopt proven practices. Key areas of focus include:

- **Architecture decision records (ADRs):** Templates and guidance for documenting significant technical decisions in a structured, reviewable format.
- **Functional specifications:** Frameworks for capturing system behavior requirements clearly and completely.
- **System quality attributes:** Resources addressing non-functional requirements such as performance, reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
- **Git workflow recommendations:** Practical advice on branching strategies, commit conventions, and collaboration patterns.
- **Monorepo versus polyrepo guidance:** Analysis of trade-offs in repository organization strategies for teams and organizations.
- **Hands-on code demonstrations:** Working examples that illustrate concepts in practice rather than theory alone.

These repositories are freely available on GitHub and serve as living references that evolve with the community's contributions and feedback.

## Business capabilities

Beyond technology, Joel provides resources oriented toward managers, executives, and organizational leaders. These materials cover essential business planning and performance management practices.

| Practice | Abbreviation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Objectives and Key Results | OKRs | Define measurable goals and track outcomes against ambitious targets |
| Key Performance Indicators | KPIs | Quantify ongoing operational and strategic performance |
| Strategic Balanced Scorecards | SBS | Align financial, customer, process, and learning perspectives |
| Value Stream Mappings | VSMs | Visualize and optimize the flow of value delivery to customers |
| Statements of Work | SOWs | Define project scope, deliverables, timelines, and agreements |

This combination of technology and business resources reflects a philosophy that effective technology professionals must understand both domains. Technical excellence without business alignment often leads to well-built products that miss the market. Business strategy without technical grounding often leads to unrealistic plans and poor execution.

## Open source and community contributions

Joel is an active contributor to the free libre open source software (FLOSS) ecosystem. His GitHub profile hosts numerous repositories that the developer community can use, fork, and contribute to. This commitment to open source is consistent with the editorial philosophy behind the topics collection: knowledge should be accessible, shareable, and community-driven.

Key online profiles and resources include:

- **LinkedIn:** Professional profile and network connections at linkedin.com/in/joelparkerhenderson
- **GitHub:** Open source repositories and code contributions at github.com/joelparkerhenderson
- **Linktree:** Aggregated links to projects and resources at linktr.ee/joelparkerhenderson

## Personal values and advocacy

Joel advocates for charitable giving and supports organizations that advance technology freedom, human rights, and public health. His favored charities reveal the values that inform his editorial perspective:

| Organization | Abbreviation | Mission Area |
|---|---|---|
| Apache Software Foundation | ASF | Open source software development and stewardship |
| Electronic Frontier Foundation | EFF | Digital civil liberties and online privacy |
| Free Software Foundation | FSF | Software freedom and user rights |
| Amnesty International | AI | International human rights protection |
| Center for Environmental Health | CEH | Environmental health and justice |
| Médecins Sans Frontières | MSF | Medical humanitarian aid worldwide |
| Human Rights Watch | HRW | Human rights research and advocacy |

Beyond professional work, Joel is an avid traveler who values cross-cultural understanding and building connections with people from diverse backgrounds. He is also a musician who plays guitar. These personal interests contribute to a broad worldview that enriches the editorial perspective across the topics collection.

## Why editorial context matters

Understanding the background of a content creator is important for any technology professional evaluating educational material. An editor who combines hands-on software development experience with business consulting brings a pragmatic, applied perspective rather than a purely academic one. Joel's open source contributions demonstrate a commitment to giving back to the community, and his charitable advocacy signals a values-driven approach to technology work. This context helps readers calibrate the advice, examples, and frameworks presented throughout the collection.
