# About the Editor: Tutorial

## Overview

The Agile Change Guide is edited by Joel Parker Henderson, a software developer, writer, and consultant who works at the intersection of technology and business. Understanding the background, expertise, and values of the guide's editor provides important context for how the guide was developed and why it covers the topics it does. This tutorial explores the editor's professional and personal background and draws lessons that agile change technology professionals can apply to their own careers and contributions.

## Key Concepts

### Professional Background

Joel Parker Henderson consults for companies that seek to leverage both technology capabilities and business capabilities. His clients span the full spectrum: venture capital startups, Fortune 500 enterprises, and nonprofit organizations. This breadth of experience means the guide is informed by a wide range of real-world contexts, from scrappy early-stage companies to large, complex enterprises.

His technology work includes creating repositories for developers who work with:

- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Functional specifications
- System quality attributes
- Git workflow recommendations
- Monorepo versus polyrepo guidance
- Hands-on code demonstrations

His business work includes creating repositories for managers who work with:

- Objectives and key results (OKRs)
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Strategic balanced scorecards (SBS)
- Value stream mappings (VSMs)
- Statements of work (SOWs)

This dual focus on technology and business is a hallmark of effective agile change professionals, who must bridge the gap between technical implementation and business value.

### Open Source and Community Contribution

The editor is a committed contributor to free, libre, and open source software (FLOSS). The Agile Change Guide itself is open source, reflecting a belief that knowledge should be freely shared and collaboratively improved. This philosophy aligns with agile values of transparency, collaboration, and community.

### Personal Values

The editor advocates for charitable donations and supports organizations such as the Apache Software Foundation, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Free Software Foundation, Amnesty International, and Doctors Without Borders, among others. These commitments reflect values of social responsibility, fairness, and a desire to use one's skills and platform for positive impact.

### Continuous Learning

The editor's wide-ranging interests -- from technology to travel to music -- demonstrate a commitment to lifelong learning and a curiosity that extends beyond professional boundaries. This breadth of perspective is valuable for agile change professionals, who benefit from diverse experiences and the ability to draw connections between disparate fields.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Bridge technology and business.** Follow the editor's example by developing competence in both technical and business domains. Agile change professionals who understand both sides are more effective at driving change, communicating value, and building stakeholder support.

2. **Contribute to open source.** If you have knowledge or tools that could benefit the community, consider sharing them as open-source projects. This builds your professional reputation, sharpens your skills, and contributes to the broader ecosystem.

3. **Create and share knowledge resources.** Whether through repositories, blog posts, tutorials, or internal documentation, invest in creating resources that help others learn. Knowledge sharing is a multiplier that amplifies your impact.

4. **Build a diverse portfolio of experience.** Seek opportunities to work with different types of organizations -- startups, enterprises, nonprofits. Each context provides unique lessons and broadens your perspective.

5. **Invest in community and social responsibility.** Find ways to use your professional skills for social good. Volunteer, donate, mentor, or contribute to causes you care about. This enriches your professional life and builds a network of purpose-driven colleagues.

6. **Pursue lifelong learning.** Stay curious. Read broadly, attend conferences, learn new technologies, and explore interests outside your primary domain. The connections you make between different fields will fuel creative problem-solving in your agile practice.

## Key Takeaway

The background of the Agile Change Guide's editor illustrates a career built on the integration of technology and business expertise, a commitment to open-source knowledge sharing, and a dedication to continuous learning and social responsibility. For agile change technology professionals, these qualities are not merely admirable -- they are practical assets that enhance effectiveness, broaden perspective, and deepen impact. Build your career on the same foundations: technical and business fluency, community contribution, diverse experience, and a commitment to lifelong growth.
