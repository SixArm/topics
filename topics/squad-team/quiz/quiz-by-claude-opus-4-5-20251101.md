  <p>A squad team brings together individuals from different functions such as design, engineering, marketing, and product to work towards a specific objective. This cross-functional composition, combined with self-organization and autonomy, distinguishes squad teams from traditional hierarchical or siloed team structures. The model was popularized by Spotify and is commonly used in startups and agile environments where speed and adaptability are essential.</p>
