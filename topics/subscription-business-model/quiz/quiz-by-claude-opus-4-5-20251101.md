  <p>Retention strategy</p>
  <p>Because customers pay a recurring fee, subscription businesses must have a strong retention strategy to keep customers engaged and prevent churn. This includes offering exclusive content or features, providing excellent customer service, and optimizing the user experience. While acquisition, value proposition, and payment models are all important, retention directly addresses the ongoing challenge of maintaining recurring revenue by reducing customer cancellations.</p>
