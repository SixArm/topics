  <p>As soon as the work is created and fixed in a tangible form</p>
  <p>Copyright protection is automatically granted to original works of authorship the moment they are created and fixed in a tangible form (such as written text, recorded audio, or saved code). Registration with a government agency like the U.S. Copyright Office is not required for protection to exist, though it can provide additional legal benefits such as the ability to sue for infringement and claim statutory damages.</p>
