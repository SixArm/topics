  <p>To temporarily set aside a topic for later discussion while keeping the current conversation on track</p>
  <p>"Put a pin in it" means to acknowledge an important topic but defer it to prevent distraction and derailment of the current discussion. The item is recorded so it won't be forgotten, but the conversation continues without getting bogged down. This technique is valuable in both meetings and project management for maintaining focus while ensuring nothing is overlooked.</p>
