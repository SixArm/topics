# Put a pin in it

"Put a pin in it" is a widely used expression in business, project management, and collaborative settings. The phrase means to temporarily set aside a particular topic or issue, with the explicit intent of returning to it later. It enables teams to maintain focus on the current agenda without losing track of important but tangential concerns. For technology professionals, this concept is foundational to effective meetings, agile ceremonies, sprint planning, and stakeholder management, where time is limited and topics compete for attention.

## Origin and Meaning

The phrase likely originates from the physical act of pinning a note to a board, marking it for future attention. In modern professional usage, it signals a deliberate and respectful deferral. Saying "let's put a pin in it" communicates three things simultaneously: the topic has been heard, it has value, and it will not be forgotten. This distinguishes it from dismissing or ignoring an issue outright. The phrase carries an implicit promise of follow-through, which makes it both a communication tool and a commitment mechanism.

## Why It Matters in Technology Work

Technology professionals operate in environments dense with complexity. A single standup, sprint review, or architecture discussion can surface dozens of threads, each with legitimate urgency. Without a mechanism to defer topics gracefully, meetings spiral, decisions stall, and participants disengage. "Putting a pin in it" serves as a pressure valve, allowing teams to stay on track while preserving institutional awareness of open items.

This is especially critical in cross-functional settings where engineers, designers, product managers, and business stakeholders each bring distinct priorities. A designer may raise a usability concern during a backend architecture review. Rather than derailing the review, the team pins the concern and schedules an appropriate forum for it.

## Common Scenarios

- **Sprint planning meetings**: A developer raises a technical debt issue unrelated to the current sprint goals. The scrum master pins it for backlog grooming.
- **Incident response**: During a production outage, someone identifies a secondary vulnerability. The team pins it and files a follow-up ticket after the immediate issue is resolved.
- **Stakeholder reviews**: A business leader asks about a feature outside the current release scope. The product manager pins it and adds it to the roadmap discussion agenda.
- **Architecture discussions**: An engineer proposes a refactor that would affect multiple services. The team pins it for a dedicated design review session.
- **One-on-one meetings**: A manager and report surface a career development topic that needs more time than the current meeting allows. They pin it for a dedicated conversation.

## How to Use It Effectively

Simply saying "let's put a pin in it" is not enough. Without follow-through, the phrase erodes trust and becomes a euphemism for avoidance. Effective use requires a lightweight but reliable system for capturing and revisiting deferred items.

| Practice | Description |
|---|---|
| Capture immediately | Write the deferred item down in a visible, shared location such as a parking lot board, a meeting notes document, or a ticket system. |
| Assign an owner | Designate someone responsible for ensuring the item is revisited. Without ownership, deferred items drift into oblivion. |
| Set a timeframe | Specify when the item will be addressed, whether later in the same meeting, at the next standup, or in a scheduled follow-up session. |
| Close the loop | When the item is eventually addressed, explicitly reference that it was previously pinned. This reinforces trust in the process. |
| Review regularly | During retrospectives or weekly syncs, review any outstanding pinned items to prevent accumulation. |

## The Parking Lot Technique

The "parking lot" is a formalized version of putting a pin in it. Teams maintain a visible list, often on a whiteboard, shared document, or project management tool, where deferred items are recorded during meetings. At the end of the meeting or during a designated time, the team reviews the parking lot and decides the next step for each item: schedule a follow-up, create a ticket, assign to a specific person, or discard if no longer relevant.

This technique is widely used in agile ceremonies, facilitated workshops, and design sprints. It transforms an informal verbal agreement into a trackable artifact.

## Comparison With Related Approaches

| Approach | Intent | Follow-through mechanism | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Put a pin in it | Defer a topic with intent to return | Verbal commitment, parking lot, or ticket | Forgotten if not captured |
| Table the discussion | Formally postpone a topic, often indefinitely | Meeting minutes or formal motion | May never be revisited |
| Take it offline | Move a topic to a smaller or more appropriate group | Direct conversation or side meeting | Lacks visibility to the broader team |
| Add to backlog | Capture as a work item for future prioritization | Project management tool | May be deprioritized indefinitely |
| Timeboxing | Allocate a fixed amount of time to the topic now | Meeting facilitation | May not allow sufficient depth |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Pinning without recording**: If the deferred item exists only in memory, it will likely be lost. Always write it down.
- **Chronic deferral**: Repeatedly pinning the same topic signals avoidance rather than prioritization. If an item keeps coming up, it needs to be addressed.
- **Using it to silence dissent**: The phrase should never be weaponized to shut down legitimate concerns or uncomfortable feedback. It must be used in good faith.
- **Lack of follow-through**: Saying "we'll come back to it" and never doing so damages team trust and discourages people from raising issues in the future.
- **Over-pinning**: If most topics in a meeting get pinned, the meeting agenda itself may need restructuring.

## Summary

"Put a pin in it" is a deceptively simple phrase that, when used well, becomes a powerful tool for managing complexity in technology work. It allows teams to acknowledge important topics without sacrificing focus, provided that deferred items are captured, owned, and revisited. The phrase works best as part of a broader culture of disciplined communication and follow-through, where every pinned item is a promise kept rather than a concern dismissed.
