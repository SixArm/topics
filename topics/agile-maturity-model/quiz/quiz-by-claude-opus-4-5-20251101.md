  <p>To serve as both an assessment tool and a roadmap for improving agile implementation</p>
  <p>An agile maturity model serves a dual purpose: it helps organizations assess their current state of agile adoption and provides a structured roadmap for improvement. It enables organizations to identify gaps in their agile implementation and develop targeted strategies for advancement through distinct stages of maturity, rather than enforcing rigid compliance or measuring individual performance.</p>
