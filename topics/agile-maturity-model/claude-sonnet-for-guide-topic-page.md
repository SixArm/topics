# Agile maturity model

An agile maturity model represents a framework for assessing and improving an organization's capability to implement agile software development practices effectively. This model provides a structured approach to understanding how teams and organizations evolve in their agile adoption journey, moving through distinct stages of maturity that reflect increasing sophistication in agile implementation.

Organizations typically begin at the initial stage, where agile practices are introduced but often implemented inconsistently or in isolation. As maturity progresses, organizations develop more approaches and ways of working, establishing better business value, improving collaboration, and beginning to measure outcomes effectively.

The intermediate maturity levels focus on optimization and continuous improvement. Organizations at this stage demonstrate strong cross-functional collaboration, effective use of metrics and feedback loops, and the ability to adapt practices based on lessons learned. They move beyond merely following agile rituals to embracing agile values and principles in their decision-making processes.

At higher maturity levels, organizations achieve true agile transformation where practices become deeply embedded in the organizational culture. They demonstrate excellence in areas such as customer collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working software frequently. These organizations can scale agile practices across multiple teams and departments while maintaining quality and efficiency.

The maturity model serves as both an assessment tool and a roadmap for improvement. It helps organizations identify their current state, understand gaps in their agile implementation, and develop targeted strategies for advancement.
