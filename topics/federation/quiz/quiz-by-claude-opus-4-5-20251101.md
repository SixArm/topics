  <p>Each participating system maintains control over its own resources while sharing information in a standardized way</p>
  <p>Federation is a system design pattern where different systems or organizations work together as if they were unified, while each system retains control over its own resources and data. This distributed approach enables advantages like scalability, flexibility, and higher availability due to the absence of a central point of failure.</p>
