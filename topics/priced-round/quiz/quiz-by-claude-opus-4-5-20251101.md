  <p>The company and investors agree on a valuation before the investment is made</p>
  <p>In a priced round, the company and investors agree on a specific valuation before the investment, and new shares are issued at a price per share determined by that valuation. This contrasts with convertible notes or uncapped instruments where valuation is deferred to a later financing event. This upfront valuation provides more certainty for both parties regarding ownership percentages and potential returns.</p>
