# Priced round

A priced round is a type of venture capital financing in which a startup and its investors formally agree on a company valuation before the investment is made. The company issues new shares of stock at a specific price per share, and investors purchase those shares with cash. This mechanism stands in contrast to convertible instruments such as convertible notes or SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity), which defer the valuation question to a later date. Priced rounds are a cornerstone of startup fundraising, particularly at the Series A stage and beyond, and they establish the legal and financial foundation for the relationship between founders and institutional investors.

## How a priced round works

In a priced round, the company and its investors negotiate a pre-money valuation, which represents the company's worth immediately before the new capital is invested. Once that valuation is set, the price per share is calculated by dividing the pre-money valuation by the total number of outstanding shares (including the option pool). Investors then purchase newly issued shares at that price, and the total capital raised is added to the pre-money valuation to produce the post-money valuation.

For example, if a company has a pre-money valuation of $20 million and raises $5 million in a priced round, its post-money valuation is $25 million. The investors collectively own 20% of the company ($5M / $25M), and the existing shareholders retain the remaining 80%, subject to dilution from any expanded option pool.

The price per share is determined by a combination of factors including revenue trajectory, user growth, total addressable market, competitive landscape, intellectual property, and the strength of the founding team. Both sides typically engage legal counsel and may involve financial advisors to arrive at terms that reflect the company's risk profile and growth potential.

## Key terms in a priced round

A priced round introduces several important legal and financial terms that govern the investment. Understanding these terms is essential for both founders and investors.

- **Pre-money valuation**: The agreed-upon value of the company before the new investment is added. This is the anchor for all share price calculations.
- **Post-money valuation**: The pre-money valuation plus the total amount of capital raised in the round. This determines each investor's ownership percentage.
- **Price per share**: The pre-money valuation divided by the fully diluted share count. This is the price investors pay for each new share.
- **Liquidation preference**: A provision that determines the order and amount investors receive in a liquidation event such as an acquisition. A 1x non-participating liquidation preference means investors get their money back before common shareholders receive anything.
- **Anti-dilution protection**: A clause that protects investors if the company raises a future round at a lower valuation (a "down round"). Weighted average anti-dilution is the most common form.
- **Board seats**: Investors in priced rounds, especially lead investors, often negotiate for one or more seats on the company's board of directors.
- **Pro-rata rights**: The right for existing investors to participate in future funding rounds to maintain their ownership percentage.
- **Protective provisions**: Veto rights that give investors control over certain corporate actions, such as issuing new shares, taking on debt, or selling the company.

## Priced round versus convertible instruments

Founders often choose between a priced round and convertible instruments when raising capital. Each approach has distinct advantages and trade-offs depending on the stage of the company, the amount being raised, and the complexity the parties are willing to accept.

| Factor | Priced round | Convertible note / SAFE |
|---|---|---|
| Valuation | Set explicitly at the time of investment | Deferred to a future priced round |
| Legal complexity | High; requires extensive documentation | Low; simpler agreements |
| Legal cost | Typically $20K–$50K+ in legal fees | Typically $2K–$10K in legal fees |
| Time to close | Weeks to months | Days to weeks |
| Investor protections | Comprehensive (board seats, preferences, anti-dilution) | Minimal until conversion |
| Best suited for | Series A and later stages | Pre-seed and seed stages |
| Dilution clarity | Immediate and transparent | Uncertain until conversion |
| Negotiation intensity | High; multiple term sheet provisions | Low; primarily valuation cap and discount rate |

Convertible instruments are popular for early-stage raises because they are fast, inexpensive, and avoid the difficulty of setting a valuation when the company has limited operating history. Priced rounds become the preferred mechanism once the company has meaningful traction, because both founders and investors benefit from the clarity and structure that a formal valuation provides.

## Stages of a priced round

A priced round follows a structured process that typically unfolds over several weeks or months.

- **Preparation**: The company assembles its data room, including financial statements, cap table, customer metrics, legal documents, and a pitch deck. Founders identify target investors and begin outreach.
- **Term sheet negotiation**: A lead investor issues a term sheet outlining the proposed valuation, investment amount, and key terms. The founder and the lead investor negotiate until both sides agree.
- **Due diligence**: The lead investor and other participating investors conduct a thorough review of the company's financials, technology, intellectual property, legal standing, and market position.
- **Definitive documents**: Lawyers draft the final legal agreements, which typically include a stock purchase agreement, investor rights agreement, right of first refusal and co-sale agreement, and voting agreement.
- **Closing**: All parties sign the documents, funds are wired, and the company issues new shares to the investors. The cap table is updated, and any new board members are formally appointed.

## Advantages of priced rounds

Priced rounds offer several benefits that make them the standard mechanism for significant venture capital investments.

- **Valuation clarity**: All parties know exactly what the company is worth and what percentage each investor owns. This eliminates the ambiguity that convertible instruments create.
- **Stronger investor commitment**: The formal structure signals that investors have performed due diligence and are committed to the company's long-term success.
- **Governance structure**: Board seats and protective provisions create a governance framework that can improve decision-making and accountability.
- **Alignment of incentives**: Clear ownership stakes and defined rights align the interests of founders, early employees, and investors around shared milestones.
- **Credibility signal**: Completing a priced round at a strong valuation serves as a market signal that can attract talent, customers, and future investors.

## Risks and challenges

Despite their advantages, priced rounds introduce complexity and potential friction that founders should anticipate.

- **High legal costs**: The extensive documentation required for a priced round can cost tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, which is a meaningful expense for early-stage companies.
- **Time-consuming process**: Negotiations, due diligence, and legal drafting can take months, during which the company must continue operating and growing.
- **Valuation pressure**: If the agreed-upon valuation is too high, the company faces pressure to grow into that valuation before raising again. A subsequent down round can damage morale and trigger anti-dilution provisions that punish founders.
- **Loss of control**: Board seats, protective provisions, and voting agreements can limit a founder's ability to make unilateral decisions about the company's direction.
- **Signaling risk**: If a well-known investor leads a priced round but declines to participate in the next round, it can send a negative signal to the market about the company's prospects.

## When to pursue a priced round

The decision of when to pursue a priced round depends on the company's stage, traction, and capital needs. As a general framework:

- **Pre-seed and seed stage**: Convertible notes or SAFEs are usually more appropriate. The company lacks sufficient data to justify a formal valuation, and the speed and simplicity of convertible instruments are valuable when capital needs are modest.
- **Series A**: This is the most common entry point for a priced round. The company typically has product-market fit, meaningful revenue or user growth, and a clear go-to-market strategy. Institutional venture capital firms expect priced round mechanics at this stage.
- **Series B and beyond**: Priced rounds are standard. The company has a proven business model, and the larger capital amounts involved require the structure and protections that priced rounds provide.

## Summary

A priced round is the formal mechanism by which startups raise venture capital at an explicitly agreed-upon valuation, issuing new shares to investors at a defined price per share. It establishes the legal, financial, and governance framework for the investor-founder relationship, including provisions for liquidation preferences, anti-dilution protection, board representation, and pro-rata rights. While priced rounds are more complex and costly than convertible instruments, they provide the valuation clarity, investor protections, and structural rigor that both founders and institutional investors require as a company scales beyond its earliest stages.
