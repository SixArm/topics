  <p>To enable organizations to report their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in a standardized and transparent manner</p>
  <p>The GRI Standards provide a set of guidelines that help organizations report on their sustainability performance in a clear, consistent, and transparent way. This allows stakeholders—including investors, employees, customers, and the public—to understand an organization's ESG impact. GRI is a reporting framework, not a certification body or regulatory enforcer.</p>
