  <p>Empowered teams are accountable for solving customer and business problems, while feature teams focus on executing tasks</p>
  <p>Cagan emphasizes that the fundamental distinction is accountability and ownership. Empowered teams focus on outcomes—solving meaningful customer and business problems—and own how to achieve those outcomes. Feature teams, in contrast, are focused on implementing assigned tasks and features without the same level of problem-solving autonomy and accountability for results.</p>
