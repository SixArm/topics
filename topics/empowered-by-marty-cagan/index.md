# Empowered: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Products

"Empowered: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Products" by Marty Cagan and Chris
Jones explores how companies can consistently innovate by creating environments
that let teams do their best work. The core argument: it's not just about hiring
talent—it’s about empowering teams to solve meaningful problems collaboratively.

**Empowered vs. Feature Teams:** Empowered teams are accountable for solving
customer and business problems, not just implementing features. Feature teams
focus on executing tasks; empowered teams focus on outcomes and ownership.

**Essentials:** Coaching: every leader should act as a coach,
not a commander. Staffing: hire people with character and potential, then
develop their capabilities. Product vision-- a compelling north star aligns and
inspires teams. Product strategy: Focus on the few problems that truly matter.
Collaboration: empowered teams thrive through strong partnerships.

**Leadership:** Leaders’ main role is to coach their teams toward competence and
ownership. This includes assessments over product, process, and people
skills—and continuous feedback to elevate them.

**Product Discovery & Strategy:** Teams must deeply understand customer needs,
test solutions rapidly, and use tools like the Opportunity Solution Tree or
Product Vision Canvas to translate strategic insight into action.

**Embedding Metrics & Accountability:** Empowered teams are fully accountable
for their outcomes, using meaningful metrics to assess customer impact and
business value. Leaders define problems—not features—and teams own how to solve
them.

**Organizational Transformation:** Achieving truly empowered product culture
takes time- a mix of pilots, stakeholder alignment, and cultural shifts.
