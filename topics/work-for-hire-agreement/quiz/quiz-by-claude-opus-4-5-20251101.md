  <p>The hiring party owns the work produced, rather than the individual who created it</p>
  <p>A work-for-hire agreement specifies that the work produced is owned by the hiring party, not the freelancer or independent contractor who created it. This is the fundamental purpose of such agreements—to transfer intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, and trademarks) from the creator to the commissioning party upon creation of the work.</p>
