# Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

Question: In a Discretionary Access Control (DAC) system, who has the authority to control access permissions for an object?

- [ ] The system kernel exclusively

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>The owner of the object</p>
  <p>In DAC, the owner of an object has complete control over access permissions, deciding who can access the object and what operations they can perform. This distinguishes DAC from Mandatory Access Control (MAC), where a centralized security policy determines access rather than the object's owner.</p>
