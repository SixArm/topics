# Parallel processing

Question: What is the primary purpose of parallel processing in computing?

- [ ] To reduce power consumption by using fewer processor cycles
- [ ] To execute multiple tasks simultaneously by dividing them into smaller independent tasks run on multiple processors
- [ ] To simplify programming by eliminating the need for synchronization
- [ ] To ensure all tasks are executed in a strict sequential order

  <p>To execute multiple tasks simultaneously by dividing them into smaller independent tasks run on multiple processors</p>
  <p>Parallel processing improves performance and speed by breaking tasks into smaller, independent components that can be executed concurrently across multiple processors or computing resources. This approach reduces processing time for complex tasks and enables faster processing of large data sets.</p>
