  <p>To test the market and gather customer feedback with minimal investment before committing significant resources</p>
  <p>The MVP approach allows companies to release a basic version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and gather feedback. This enables teams to validate market assumptions, learn from real user interactions, and iterate on the product before investing heavily in full development—reducing risk and avoiding costly mistakes by ensuring the product meets actual customer needs.</p>
