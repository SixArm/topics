  <p>Viewing interconnected relationships and understanding how changes affect the entire ecosystem</p>
  <p>Systems thinking is a holistic perspective that views interconnected relationships rather than isolated components. It encourages teams to consider the broader ecosystem when implementing changes, examining how modifications affect the entire product lifecycle—from user feedback loops to deployment pipelines. This approach helps identify bottlenecks, dependencies, and emergent properties that arise from the interaction of system components, including both technical elements and human factors like team dynamics and organizational culture.</p>
