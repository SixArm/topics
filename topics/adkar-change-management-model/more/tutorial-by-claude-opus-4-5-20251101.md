## ADKAR Change Management Model

The ADKAR model is a goal-oriented change management framework developed by Prosci, one of the most respected organizations in change management research. The acronym represents five sequential outcomes an individual must achieve for change to be successful: **Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, and Reinforcement**.

For technology professionals, ADKAR is particularly valuable when rolling out new systems, migrating platforms, restructuring teams, or implementing new development methodologies. Unlike frameworks that focus solely on organizational processes, ADKAR addresses the human side of change—the factor most responsible for project success or failure.

## Why Technology Professionals Need ADKAR

Technical change initiatives fail at staggering rates. Research consistently shows that 60-70% of organizational change efforts do not achieve their intended outcomes. The root cause is rarely technical—it's human resistance, inadequate communication, or insufficient support.

Consider common technology scenarios where ADKAR applies:

| Scenario | Common Failure Point | ADKAR Solution |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Cloud migration | Users revert to legacy systems | Build awareness of security and collaboration benefits |
| Agile adoption | Teams pay lip service to ceremonies | Create genuine desire through demonstrated wins |
| New tooling rollout | Low adoption after training | Ensure ability through hands-on practice and coaching |
| Security policy changes | Workarounds emerge | Reinforce through recognition and accountability |
| DevOps transformation | Silos persist | Address each stage for every affected role |

## The Five Elements of ADKAR

### Awareness

Awareness is the foundation. Individuals must understand *why* change is happening before they can engage with it. This is not simply announcing a change—it requires communicating:

- The business reasons driving the change
- The risks of not changing
- How the change aligns with organizational goals
- What will happen if the organization stays on the current path

**For technology teams:** When implementing a new CI/CD pipeline, awareness means explaining why manual deployments create risk, how competitors are moving faster, and what the cost of deployment failures has been. Simply mandating a new tool without context breeds resentment.

**Key questions to assess awareness:**
- Do stakeholders understand the nature of the change?
- Can they articulate why it's necessary?
- Do they recognize the consequences of not changing?

### Desire

Awareness alone does not create motivation. Desire addresses the personal choice to support and participate in change. People naturally ask "What's in it for me?" and "What will I lose?"

Building desire requires:

- Connecting the change to personal benefits (career growth, reduced frustration, new skills)
- Addressing fears and concerns directly
- Involving people in shaping the change where possible
- Demonstrating leadership commitment
- Identifying and leveraging change champions

**For technology teams:** A developer may understand that a new framework improves performance, but resist learning it because they've invested years mastering the current stack. Address this by highlighting how the new skills increase marketability, or by showing how the framework reduces tedious boilerplate they currently write.

**Resistance indicators:**
- Passive non-compliance
- Vocal criticism without constructive alternatives
- "We've always done it this way" responses
- Requests for exceptions or delays

### Knowledge

Once individuals want to change, they need to know *how*. Knowledge encompasses:

- Understanding new processes, systems, or behaviors
- Learning required skills
- Knowing where to find resources and support
- Understanding their specific role in the changed environment

**For technology teams:** Knowledge is often where organizations focus exclusively—and prematurely. Sending developers to a Kubernetes training before they understand why containerization matters (awareness) or see personal value in learning it (desire) wastes resources. Training sticks when it follows genuine readiness to learn.

**Effective knowledge transfer includes:**
- Formal training programs
- Documentation and reference materials
- Mentoring and peer learning
- Hands-on workshops
- Just-in-time learning resources

### Ability

Knowledge and ability are distinct. Knowing how to do something differs from being able to perform it consistently in practice. Ability requires:

- Time to practice and build proficiency
- Coaching and feedback during the learning curve
- Access to necessary tools and resources
- Removal of barriers that prevent application
- Psychological safety to make mistakes

**For technology teams:** A team may complete Agile certification (knowledge) but struggle to run effective retrospectives or break work into appropriately sized stories (ability). Ability develops through repetition, coaching, and learning from failure. Plan for a productivity dip during this phase.

**Ability blockers to identify:**
- Insufficient time allocated for practice
- Competing priorities that prevent focus
- Missing tools or system access
- Psychological barriers (fear of failure, perfectionism)
- Physical or cognitive limitations

### Reinforcement

Without reinforcement, change erodes. Old habits reassert themselves. Reinforcement sustains change through:

- Celebrating milestones and successes
- Recognizing individuals who embrace the change
- Measuring and sharing progress
- Addressing regression promptly
- Embedding change into systems, processes, and culture

**For technology teams:** After a successful migration to a new observability platform, reinforcement means updating onboarding to include it, retiring old dashboards, including metrics reviews in sprint ceremonies, and recognizing teams that leverage the new capabilities effectively.

**Reinforcement mechanisms:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Recognition | Public acknowledgment, awards, promotions |
| Accountability | Updated performance expectations, process audits |
| Structural | Policy updates, system changes, retired legacy options |
| Cultural | Leadership modeling, storytelling, success celebration |

## Applying ADKAR: A Sequential Process

ADKAR is sequential—each element builds on the previous. Attempting to provide training (Knowledge) before building Desire leads to wasted investment. Expecting performance (Ability) without adequate Knowledge creates frustration and failure.

**Assessment approach:**

1. Identify the barrier point—where in ADKAR is the individual or group stuck?
2. Address that specific barrier before advancing
3. Recognize that different individuals progress at different rates
4. Plan interventions appropriate to each stage

| If stuck at... | Symptoms | Interventions |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| Awareness | "I didn't know this was happening" | Communication, one-on-ones, town halls |
| Desire | "I don't want to do this" | Coaching, addressing concerns, demonstrating WIIFM |
| Knowledge | "I don't know how to do this" | Training, documentation, mentoring |
| Ability | "I can't do this consistently" | Practice time, coaching, barrier removal |
| Reinforcement | "I'm slipping back to old ways" | Recognition, accountability, structural changes |

## ADKAR for Technology Leaders

Technology leaders can apply ADKAR both to their teams and to stakeholders affected by technology changes:

**When leading your team through change:**
- Start communications with the "why" before the "what"
- Create space for concerns to surface without judgment
- Pair training with practical application
- Protect practice time during the ability-building phase
- Build recognition into your team's rhythm

**When driving technology change across the organization:**
- Partner with HR and communications for awareness campaigns
- Identify executive sponsors who model desire
- Develop role-specific training for knowledge transfer
- Provide support resources during the ability phase
- Define metrics that reinforce adoption

## ADKAR vs. Other Change Models

| Model | Focus | Best For |
|-------|-------|----------|
| ADKAR | Individual change outcomes | Tactical execution, identifying barriers |
| Kotter's 8-Step | Organizational transformation | Large-scale strategic change |
| Lewin's Change Model | Phase-based (unfreeze-change-refreeze) | Conceptual understanding |
| Bridges' Transition Model | Emotional journey | Managing human reactions |

ADKAR complements rather than replaces other models. Use Kotter for organizational strategy and ADKAR for individual execution. ADKAR's strength is its diagnostic capability—pinpointing exactly where change is failing and prescribing specific interventions.

## Common ADKAR Mistakes

- **Skipping to Knowledge:** Assuming awareness and desire exist when they don't
- **One-size-fits-all:** Treating everyone as if they're at the same stage
- **Underestimating Reinforcement:** Declaring victory too early
- **Ignoring informal networks:** Focusing only on formal hierarchy
- **Rushing the timeline:** Not allowing adequate time for ability to develop

## Key Takeaways

- ADKAR provides a diagnostic framework to identify exactly where change is stalling
- The five elements are sequential—skipping stages undermines success
- Technical excellence alone does not ensure technology change success
- Individual readiness varies; segment your approach accordingly
- Reinforcement is not optional—it determines whether change persists
- ADKAR works for changes you're leading and changes being imposed on you

For technology professionals, mastering ADKAR transforms you from someone who implements systems to someone who successfully drives adoption. The difference between a deployed system and a utilized system is human change management.
