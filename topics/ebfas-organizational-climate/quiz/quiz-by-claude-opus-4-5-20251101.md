  <p>To enable organization members to operate inside opponent's OODA loops</p>
  <p>John Boyd developed EBFAS (Einheit, Behendigkeit, Fingerspitzengefühl, Auftragstaktik, Schwerpunkt) as guidance for improving organizational climate. The framework's core purpose is to enable faster, more adaptive decision-making that allows an organization to act more quickly than competitors—operating inside their OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loops. This gives organizations a strategic advantage through unity, agility, intuition, mission-focused tactics, and clear prioritization.</p>
