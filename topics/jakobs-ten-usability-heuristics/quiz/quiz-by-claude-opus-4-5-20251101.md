Question: Which usability heuristic recommends minimizing the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible rather than requiring users to remember information from earlier parts of an interface?

  <p>Recognition Rather Than Recall</p>
  <p>This heuristic emphasizes that users should not have to remember information from one part of a dialogue to another. Instructions, actions, and options should be visible or easily retrievable. Humans have limited short-term memory, so interfaces that rely on recognition (seeing options) rather than recall (remembering commands) significantly reduce cognitive load and make systems easier to use.</p>
