  <p>Limited flexibility due to following the franchisor's established brand and business model</p>
  <p>While franchisees benefit from a proven business model, they must adhere to the franchisor's established brand guidelines and operational procedures. This restricts their ability to make independent decisions about products, services, marketing, and business operations—a significant trade-off that technology professionals should understand when evaluating franchise opportunities or building systems to support franchise businesses.</p>
