# Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)

Question: What is the key differentiator between FPGAs and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)?

- [ ] FPGAs have lower cost compared to ASICs
- [ ] FPGAs can only perform digital signal processing tasks
- [ ] FPGAs are reprogrammable while ASICs have fixed functionality
- [ ] FPGAs cannot execute operations in parallel

  <p>FPGAs are reprogrammable while ASICs have fixed functionality</p>
  <p>Unlike ASICs, which are designed for specific tasks and have fixed functionality, FPGAs are designed to be reprogrammable, allowing users to configure their internal structure and behavior to perform various tasks. This reprogrammability makes FPGAs useful for prototyping, experimentation, iterative development, and applications where flexibility is required.</p>
