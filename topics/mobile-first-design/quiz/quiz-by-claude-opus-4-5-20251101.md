  <p>Designing for mobile devices first, then scaling up to larger screens</p>
  <p>Mobile-first design starts with creating a design specifically for mobile devices (typically smartphones), then progressively enhances it for larger screens such as tablets and desktops. This approach forces designers to prioritize content and features for limited screen space, processing power, and bandwidth, ensuring an optimal user experience across all devices through responsive design and progressive enhancement techniques.</p>
