  <p>High power distance cultures tend toward centralized decision-making with clear authority hierarchies</p>
  <p>Power distance measures how societies accept unequal distribution of power. In high power distance cultures, decision-making is often centralized, with clear distinctions between leaders and followers. This directly impacts technology teams working across cultures—understanding whether your stakeholders expect top-down directives or collaborative consultation is essential for effective communication, project management, and cross-cultural collaboration.</p>
