# Underfitting

Question: What is the primary indicator that a machine learning model is underfitting?

- [ ] The model performs well on training data but poorly on test data
- [ ] The model has too many parameters relative to the training data size
- [ ] High error on both training data and new/test data
- [ ] The model takes too long to train

  <p>High error on both training data and new/test data</p>
  <p>Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Unlike overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data), an underfitting model fails to learn even from the training data, resulting in high error rates on both the training set and validation/test sets. This indicates the model lacks sufficient complexity or capacity to represent the relationships in the data.</p>
