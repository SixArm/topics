  <p>A company that operates without growing, thriving, or dying, existing in a state of limbo</p>
  <p>A zombie company or project continues to operate but is unable to secure funding or generate sufficient revenue to sustain meaningful growth. It is characterized by stagnation and lack of innovation, focused on maintaining current operations rather than expanding. While it may survive for an extended period, it is typically not sustainable long-term and may eventually become irrelevant or shut down due to financial pressures.</p>
