  <p>The prime contractor who hired the subcontractor</p>
  <p>In a subcontracting agreement, the prime contractor maintains primary responsibility for delivering the project or contract to the client. While subcontractors perform specific portions of work or services, they are accountable to the prime contractor, not directly to the client. This hierarchical structure is fundamental to understanding subcontracting relationships and the flow of accountability in complex projects.</p>
