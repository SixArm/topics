  <p>To identify and distinguish a company's goods or services from competitors and prevent consumer confusion</p>
  <p>A trademark is a form of intellectual property that serves as a source identifier, distinguishing a company's goods or services from those of others in the marketplace. It grants the owner exclusive rights to use the mark in commerce and prevents others from using similar marks that might cause consumer confusion. This is distinct from patents (which protect inventions), trade secrets (which protect confidential information), and copyrights (which protect creative works like code).</p>
