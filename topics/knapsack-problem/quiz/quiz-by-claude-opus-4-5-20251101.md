  <p>Dynamic programming</p>
  <p>Dynamic programming is the most commonly used approach to solve the knapsack problem optimally. It breaks the problem into overlapping subproblems, computing the maximum value achievable for each combination of items and weight capacity. While greedy algorithms can provide fast approximate solutions, dynamic programming guarantees finding the optimal solution by systematically exploring all valid combinations through a recursive formula that considers whether to include or exclude each item.</p>
