# Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

Question: What is the correct sequence of the three stages in the ETL process used in data warehousing?

- [ ] Load data from sources, transform to common format, extract to destination
- [ ] Transform data first, extract from sources, load to destination
- [ ] Extract data from sources, transform to common format, load to destination
- [ ] Extract data from sources, load to staging, transform in destination

  <p>Extract data from sources, transform to common format, load to destination</p>
  <p>ETL follows a specific sequence: first, data is extracted from various sources (databases, flat files, web services); second, the data is transformed (cleaned, standardized, mapped, aggregated) into a common format suitable for the destination system; third, the transformed data is loaded into the destination system such as a data warehouse or business intelligence tool. This sequence ensures data quality and consistency before it reaches the analytical repository.</p>
