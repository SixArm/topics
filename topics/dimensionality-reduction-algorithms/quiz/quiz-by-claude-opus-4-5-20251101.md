# Dimensionality reduction algorithms

Question: What is the primary goal of dimensionality reduction algorithms in machine learning?

- [ ] To increase the number of features for more detailed analysis
- [ ] To reduce features while retaining relevant information, simplifying data and improving performance
- [ ] To convert categorical variables into numerical representations
- [ ] To normalize all data values between 0 and 1

  <p>To reduce features while retaining relevant information, simplifying data and improving performance</p>
  <p>Dimensionality reduction algorithms aim to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while preserving as much relevant information as possible. This simplifies data representation, speeds up computations, and often improves model performance by reducing noise and the curse of dimensionality.</p>
