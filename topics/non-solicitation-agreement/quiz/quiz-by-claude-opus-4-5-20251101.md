  <p>A non-solicitation agreement is a legal contract that prohibits an employee from soliciting the employer's clients, customers, or other employees for a specified period after leaving. Its purpose is to protect business relationships and prevent employees from taking advantage of relationships developed while working for the company. This is particularly relevant in technology where client relationships and team stability are critical to ongoing projects and business success.</p>
