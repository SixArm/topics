# Non-solicitation agreement

A non-solicitation agreement is a legally binding contract between an employer and an employee that restricts the employee from soliciting the employer's clients, customers, or other employees for a defined period after leaving the company. These agreements are a cornerstone of employment law in technology and other knowledge-intensive industries, where professional relationships and insider knowledge carry significant commercial value. For technology professionals, understanding the scope, enforceability, and practical implications of non-solicitation agreements is essential when negotiating employment terms, transitioning between companies, or launching a venture.

## Purpose and Business Rationale

Non-solicitation agreements exist to protect the investment a company makes in building relationships with its clients, customers, and workforce. When a technology professional works closely with enterprise clients, manages key accounts, or leads engineering teams, they accumulate knowledge about business needs, contract terms, pricing models, and interpersonal dynamics. Without a non-solicitation agreement, departing employees could leverage these relationships to redirect business to a competitor or recruit former colleagues to a rival firm. The agreement provides a contractual mechanism to prevent this, giving the former employer a reasonable window of protection during which the business can stabilize its relationships.

## Typical Provisions

Non-solicitation agreements vary in detail, but most contain several core provisions:

- **Prohibition on solicitation**: The employee agrees not to solicit the employer's clients, customers, or employees for a specified period after departure. This may extend to prohibiting the employee from working with those clients even at a new employer.
- **Definition of solicitation**: The agreement specifies what constitutes solicitation, including direct contact (phone, email, in-person meetings), indirect contact (through intermediaries), and advertising or marketing directed at the employer's relationships.
- **Scope of the agreement**: This defines the geographic area, industry sector, and duration of the restriction. A well-drafted agreement narrows scope to what is genuinely necessary.
- **Exceptions**: Agreements often carve out exceptions, such as situations where a client contacts the former employee on their own initiative, or where the relationship predates the employment.
- **Remedies**: The agreement states what the employer may seek if the employee breaches the terms, typically injunctive relief (a court order to stop the activity) and monetary damages.

## Non-Solicitation vs. Related Agreements

Technology professionals frequently encounter several types of restrictive covenants. Understanding how they differ is critical to evaluating what you are signing.

| Agreement Type | What It Restricts | Typical Duration | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Non-solicitation agreement | Contacting former employer's clients, customers, or employees | 6 months to 2 years | Protecting relationships |
| Non-compete agreement | Working for a competitor or starting a competing business | 6 months to 2 years | Preventing competition |
| Non-disclosure agreement | Sharing confidential or proprietary information | Often indefinite | Protecting information |
| Non-disparagement clause | Making negative public statements about the employer | Often indefinite | Protecting reputation |

A non-solicitation agreement is narrower than a non-compete because it does not prevent you from working in the same industry or for a competitor. It only restricts your ability to pursue specific relationships. This distinction makes non-solicitation agreements generally more enforceable than non-competes, which many jurisdictions view as overly restrictive.

## Enforceability Considerations

Courts evaluate non-solicitation agreements using a reasonableness standard. An agreement is more likely to be enforced when it meets the following criteria:

- **Reasonable duration**: Restrictions lasting 12 to 24 months are commonly upheld. Agreements extending beyond two years face increasing judicial skepticism.
- **Reasonable scope**: The restriction should be limited to clients or employees the individual actually worked with or had knowledge of, not the employer's entire client base.
- **Legitimate business interest**: The employer must demonstrate a genuine need to protect trade secrets, client relationships, or workforce stability.
- **Adequate consideration**: For new employees, the job itself may serve as consideration. For existing employees asked to sign mid-employment, additional consideration such as a bonus, promotion, or equity grant is typically required.
- **Not unduly burdensome**: The agreement must not effectively prevent the employee from earning a livelihood.

State and jurisdictional laws vary significantly. California, for example, broadly prohibits non-compete agreements and narrowly interprets non-solicitation clauses. Other states enforce them more readily. Technology professionals working across state lines or remotely should pay attention to which jurisdiction's law governs their agreement.

## Practical Implications for Technology Professionals

Technology professionals encounter non-solicitation agreements in several common scenarios:

- **Joining a new company**: Most offer letters or employment agreements in the technology sector include a non-solicitation clause. Review it before signing and negotiate terms that are specific and time-limited.
- **Leaving for a competitor**: When departing, understand exactly which relationships are restricted. Avoid reaching out to former clients or recruiting former colleagues until the restriction period expires.
- **Starting a company**: Founders leaving a previous employer must be especially careful. Building a customer base or hiring team members from the former employer during the restriction period can trigger litigation.
- **Receiving inbound interest**: If a former client reaches out to you independently, most well-drafted agreements permit this. Document the inbound nature of the contact carefully.
- **Acquisitions and mergers**: When companies are acquired, non-solicitation obligations may transfer to the acquiring entity. Review your agreement to understand assignment clauses.

## Negotiation Strategies

When presented with a non-solicitation agreement, technology professionals should consider negotiating the following points:

- **Duration**: Push for the shortest reasonable period, ideally 6 to 12 months rather than 18 to 24 months.
- **Scope**: Ensure the restriction applies only to clients or employees you directly worked with, not the entire organization.
- **Geographic limitations**: If you work in a specific region, limit the geographic scope accordingly.
- **Carve-outs**: Request explicit exceptions for inbound contact, pre-existing relationships, and general advertising or job postings.
- **Garden leave or compensation**: In some cases, employers will agree to pay you during the restriction period in exchange for stricter terms.
- **Severability clause**: A severability clause allows a court to modify an overly broad provision rather than void the entire agreement.

Technology professionals working with non-solicitation agreements should also study non-compete agreements for broader employment restrictions, non-disclosure agreements for information protection obligations, confidentiality agreements for trade secret handling, employee agreements for the full scope of employment terms, intellectual property rights and assignment clauses, and consulting agreements for independent contractor relationships. Understanding these related areas provides a complete picture of the legal landscape around employment transitions.

## Summary

A non-solicitation agreement protects an employer's client relationships and workforce stability by restricting a departing employee from soliciting specific clients, customers, or colleagues for a defined period after leaving the company. For technology professionals, these agreements are a routine part of employment but carry real consequences if violated. The key to navigating them successfully is understanding the specific provisions, negotiating reasonable terms before signing, and respecting the restrictions during the covered period. Courts enforce non-solicitation agreements that are reasonable in duration, limited in scope, and supported by a legitimate business interest, while striking down those that are overly broad or punitive.
