## Non-Solicitation Agreement

A non-solicitation agreement is a legal contract between an employer and an employee that prohibits the employee from soliciting the employer's clients, customers, or other employees for a specified period of time after the employee leaves the company.

## Purpose and Business Rationale

The primary purpose of a non-solicitation agreement is to protect business relationships and prevent departing employees from leveraging connections developed during their employment. For technology companies, these agreements are particularly important because:

- **Client relationships** often involve deep technical integrations and trust built over years
- **Specialized talent** is scarce and expensive to recruit and train
- **Proprietary knowledge** about client needs and preferences has significant competitive value
- **Team cohesion** can be disrupted when key employees recruit former colleagues

## How Non-Solicitation Differs From Related Agreements

| Agreement Type | What It Restricts | Typical Duration |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Non-Solicitation** | Contacting specific clients, customers, or employees | 6 months to 2 years |
| **Non-Compete** | Working for competitors or starting competing businesses | 1 to 2 years |
| **Non-Disclosure (NDA)** | Sharing confidential or proprietary information | Often indefinite |
| **Non-Interference** | Disrupting business relationships more broadly | 1 to 2 years |

Non-solicitation agreements are generally more enforceable than non-competes because they impose narrower restrictions on future employment.

## Typical Provisions

**Prohibition on Solicitation**

The employee agrees not to solicit the employer's clients, customers, or employees for a specified period after leaving the company. This may also include restrictions on working for a competitor or starting a competing business in ways that involve solicitation.

**Definition of Solicitation**

The agreement specifies what constitutes solicitation:

- Direct contact via phone, email, or in-person meetings
- Indirect contact through intermediaries
- Advertising or marketing directed at the employer's clients, customers, or employees
- Social media outreach or connection requests with business intent

**Scope of the Agreement**

The agreement defines boundaries across multiple dimensions:

- **Geographic area**: regional, national, or global restrictions
- **Industry sector**: specific markets or business lines covered
- **Duration**: the time period during which restrictions apply
- **Covered individuals**: which clients, customers, or employees are protected

**Exceptions**

Common carve-outs include:

- Situations where the client or customer initiates contact independently
- General advertising not specifically targeted at protected parties
- Relationships that predate the employment
- Publicly available job postings that happen to attract former colleagues

**Remedies**

If an employee violates the agreement, the employer may seek:

- Injunctions to stop ongoing solicitation
- Monetary damages for lost business
- Recovery of legal fees
- Specific performance of the agreement terms

## Enforceability Considerations

For a non-solicitation agreement to be enforceable, courts typically require:

| Factor | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Legitimate business interest** | The employer must demonstrate a genuine need to protect relationships |
| **Reasonable scope** | Restrictions cannot be overly broad in geography, duration, or coverage |
| **Adequate consideration** | The employee must receive something of value (employment, promotion, bonus) |
| **Not against public policy** | The agreement cannot unreasonably restrain trade or employment |

Courts may strike down or modify agreements that are too broad or unreasonable. Some jurisdictions are more employee-friendly and scrutinize these agreements closely.

## What Technology Professionals Should Know

**Before Signing**

- Read the agreement carefully and understand what activities are prohibited
- Negotiate narrower terms if possible (shorter duration, limited scope)
- Clarify the definition of "solicitation" and covered parties
- Understand which clients or projects you worked with that would be covered

**While Employed**

- Maintain awareness of which relationships fall under the agreement
- Document relationships that predate your employment
- Keep personal and professional networks appropriately separated

**When Departing**

- Review your agreement before accepting a new position
- Avoid contacting former clients or colleagues in ways that could be construed as solicitation
- Let protected parties reach out to you first if they wish to work together
- Consult legal counsel if you have concerns about specific activities

## Common Scenarios in Technology

| Scenario | Likely Covered | Likely Not Covered |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Recruiting a former colleague to join your new company | Yes | If they apply independently to a public posting |
| Contacting a client to offer competing services | Yes | If the client reaches out first |
| Posting on LinkedIn about your new role | No | Unless specifically targeting protected parties |
| Speaking at a conference where former clients attend | Generally no | Unless you target them directly |
| Former colleague asks you for a job referral | Depends on specifics | May be covered if you initiated the relationship discussion |

## Negotiation Strategies

When negotiating a non-solicitation agreement, consider requesting:

- **Shorter duration**: 6-12 months rather than 2 years
- **Limited coverage**: Only clients you directly worked with, not all company clients
- **Clear definitions**: Specific language about what constitutes solicitation
- **Carve-outs**: Exceptions for relationships predating employment
- **Geographic limits**: Restrictions that match the actual business footprint
- **Sunset provisions**: Automatic expiration if the company is acquired or you are terminated without cause

## Key Takeaways

- Non-solicitation agreements protect business relationships, not employment opportunities
- They are generally more enforceable than non-compete agreements
- Specificity and reasonableness determine enforceability
- Technology professionals should carefully review these agreements before signing
- When in doubt, consult an employment attorney familiar with your jurisdiction
