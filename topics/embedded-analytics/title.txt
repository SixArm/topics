Embedded analytics (places analytics at the point of need — inside a workflow or application — and makes it possible for users to take immediate action without needing to leave the application to get more information to make a decision. Embedded analytics can work the opposite way as well, where organizations put an operational workflow inside an analytics application to streamline processes. An example of this is an analytics application that identified product out-of-stock trends, having a mechanism to allow a planner to adjust the reorder threshold within the analytics dashboard for that product.)
