  <p>To provide an audio representation of visual content for users with visual impairments</p>
  <p>A screen reader is an assistive technology that reads aloud the text, icons, buttons, and other elements on the screen, enabling individuals with visual impairments or blindness to understand and navigate digital interfaces. This is distinct from screen magnifiers (which enlarge content), translation tools, or speech-to-text software (which serves users with different accessibility needs).</p>
