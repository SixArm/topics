  <p>A design technique that intentionally deceives or manipulates users into unintended actions</p>
  <p>Dark patterns are deceptive UI/UX techniques that exploit cognitive biases and psychological principles to trick or mislead users. Examples include misdirection, false urgency, forced continuity, hidden costs, and sneaking items into shopping carts. These patterns are considered unethical because they harm the user experience and manipulate people into making choices they didn't intend to make.</p>
