  <p>To issue digital certificates that verify the identity of individuals, devices, or services</p>
  <p>A Certificate Authority (CA) is an organization that issues digital certificates to verify identity. When issuing a certificate, the CA verifies the identity of the applicant and their right to use the specified domain name or other identifying information. The CA then signs the certificate with its own digital signature, establishing trust in the certificate holder's identity. This verification process is fundamental to secure electronic communications including e-commerce, online banking, and secure messaging.</p>
