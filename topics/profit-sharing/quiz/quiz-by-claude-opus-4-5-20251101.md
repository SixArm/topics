  <p>To align employee interests with company success and motivate performance</p>
  <p>Profit sharing is a compensation plan designed to motivate employees by giving them a stake in the company's financial success. When employees receive a portion of profits, they become more invested in the company's performance and are incentivized to work harder to ensure continued success. This creates a sense of ownership and aligns their interests with the overall goals of the organization.</p>
