  <p>To ensure the project stays on track by overseeing budget, timeline, scope, risks, and issues</p>
  <p>The Monitoring and Controlling phase runs throughout the project and is essential for keeping the project aligned with its goals. The project manager continuously tracks progress against the plan, manages deviations in budget and timeline, ensures scope remains controlled, and addresses risks and issues as they arise. This ongoing oversight is what distinguishes successful projects from those that fail due to unmanaged drift.</p>
