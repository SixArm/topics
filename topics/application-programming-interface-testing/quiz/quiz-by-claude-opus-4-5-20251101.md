# Application Programming Interface (API) testing

Question: What is the primary layer at which API testing operates, distinguishing it from traditional user interface testing?

- [ ] The presentation layer, examining visual elements and user interactions
- [ ] The business logic layer, examining data exchange between software systems
- [ ] The database layer, examining direct queries and stored procedures
- [ ] The network layer, examining packet transmission and routing protocols

  <p>The business logic layer, examining data exchange between software systems</p>
  <p>API testing operates at the business logic layer rather than the user interface layer. This allows teams to verify that APIs meet expected functionality requirements by examining data exchange between different software systems before the user interface is even developed, enabling earlier detection of integration issues and more focused testing of core application behavior.</p>
