  <p>Squad</p>
  <p>In Spotify's agile model, squads are small, cross-functional teams of 6-12 people that form the fundamental organizational unit. Each squad owns specific features or services, operates with minimal hierarchy, and has autonomy to choose their own tools, processes, and working methods while maintaining alignment with company objectives. Multiple squads then form larger groupings called tribes.</p>
