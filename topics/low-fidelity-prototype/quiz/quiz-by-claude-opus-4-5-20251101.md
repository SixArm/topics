# Low-fidelity prototype

Question: What is the primary purpose of creating a low-fidelity prototype in the early stages of the design process?

- [ ] To create a polished, market-ready version of the product for investor demonstrations
- [ ] To quickly and inexpensively test and iterate on ideas while gathering feedback
- [ ] To replace the need for user testing by providing a complete functional specification
- [ ] To document the final technical requirements for the development team

  <p>To quickly and inexpensively test and iterate on ideas while gathering feedback</p>
  <p>Low-fidelity prototypes are intentionally simple and rough drafts created with low-cost materials like paper, cardboard, or basic wireframes. Their purpose is to provide a basic representation of a product's structure, features, and user flow so designers can rapidly explore multiple ideas, easily modify them based on feedback, and identify usability issues early—all without significant cost or effort.</p>
