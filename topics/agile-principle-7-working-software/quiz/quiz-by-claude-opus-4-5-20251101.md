  <p>Working software that delivers tangible value</p>
  <p>Agile Principle 7 states that "working software is the primary measure of progress." This principle emphasizes that customers and end-users derive value exclusively from software that actually works and solves their problems. Documentation, plans, and metrics may appear impressive, but they provide no direct benefit to users if the software itself remains incomplete or non-functional. By prioritizing working software, teams maintain focus on delivering tangible value rather than getting caught up in excessive planning or documentation activities.</p>
