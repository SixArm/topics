# Agile Principle 7 - Working Software: Tutorial

## Overview

"Working software is the primary measure of progress."

This principle establishes a clear, unambiguous standard for evaluating how a project is progressing. Not documents produced, not tasks completed, not hours logged—working software. If the team has produced software that runs, meets user needs, and has been tested, they have made progress. If they have not, they have not.

## Why This Measure Matters

### It Is Honest

Many traditional measures of progress can be gamed or misleading:

- Tasks marked "90% complete" may remain at 90% for weeks
- Documents produced can create an illusion of progress while the actual product remains unbuilt
- Story points completed measure estimated effort, not delivered value
- Lines of code written say nothing about whether the code works or solves a problem

Working software is binary: either it works or it does not. Either users can use it or they cannot. This honesty is uncomfortable but essential.

### It Aligns the Team

When working software is the primary measure, everyone on the team—developers, testers, designers, product owners—is oriented toward the same goal. There is no ambiguity about what success looks like at the end of an iteration.

### It Generates Real Feedback

Only working software can be tested by users, demonstrated to stakeholders, and evaluated against business objectives. Documents and plans can be reviewed for theoretical correctness, but only running software reveals how the product actually behaves.

## What Counts as "Working Software"

Working software must be:

- **Functional**: It performs the operations it is designed to perform
- **Tested**: It has been verified through automated and manual testing
- **Integrated**: It works within the broader system, not just in isolation
- **Usable**: A user can interact with it and derive value from it
- **Deployable**: It is in a state where it could be released if the business chose to do so

A feature that is "code complete" but untested is not working software. A component that passes unit tests but has not been integrated with the rest of the system is not working software.

## Practical Application

### Sprint Demos

The most direct application of this principle is the sprint demo (or sprint review). At the end of each iteration, the team demonstrates working software to stakeholders. This is not a slide presentation about what was done—it is a live demonstration of running software.

### Definition of Done

Teams should establish a clear definition of done that ensures all completed work meets the standard of "working software." This typically includes:

- Code is written and peer-reviewed
- Automated tests pass
- The feature is integrated and deployed to a test environment
- Acceptance criteria are met
- No known critical defects remain

### Progress Tracking

Track progress in terms of working increments delivered, not tasks completed or story points burned. A burndown chart that shows declining work remaining is useful, but the real measure is what is demonstrably working.

## Avoiding the Trap of Proxy Measures

### Velocity Is Not Progress

Velocity (story points completed per sprint) is a planning tool, not a measure of value delivered. A team can have high velocity while building features nobody needs. Working software that satisfies customers is progress; velocity is just a planning input.

### Busyness Is Not Progress

Teams can be extremely busy—attending meetings, writing documents, discussing architecture—without producing working software. This principle redirects focus from activity to output.

### Perfectionism Is Not Progress

Spending excessive time perfecting a feature that already works can delay delivery of other valuable features. "Good enough" working software that meets user needs takes precedence over theoretical perfection, provided quality standards are maintained.

## Key Takeaway

Working software is the only reliable evidence that a development team is making progress. It cannot be faked, it generates real feedback, and it delivers actual value to users. Make it the standard your team measures itself against.
