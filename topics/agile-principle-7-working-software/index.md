# Agile principle 7: Working software

"Working software is the primary measure of progress."

This principle recognizes that customers and end-users derive value exclusively from software that actually works and solves their problems. Comprehensive documentation, detailed specifications, and elaborate project plans may appear impressive, but they provide no direct benefit to users if the software itself remains incomplete or non-functional. By prioritizing working software, teams maintain focus on delivering tangible value rather than getting caught up in potentially excessive planning or documentation activities.

The principle encourages iterative development cycles where teams consistently produce functional software increments. This creates regular opportunities for stakeholder feedback, early problem detection, and course corrections when necessary. When teams can demonstrate working features, they provide concrete evidence of progress that stakeholders can see, test, and evaluate, fostering trust and confidence in the development process.

Additionally, this principle helps teams avoid the trap of over-engineering or perfectionism that can delay delivery. It promotes a pragmatic approach where "good enough" working software that meets user needs takes precedence over theoretical perfection. This doesn't mean compromising quality, but rather ensuring that quality efforts are directed toward creating software that functions effectively in real-world conditions.
