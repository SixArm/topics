# Agile principle 7: Working software

"Working software is the primary measure of progress."

In agile software development, working software serves as the most reliable and meaningful indicator of a project's advancement. This principle emphasizes that tangible, functional code demonstrates real progress far more effectively than traditional metrics like documentation completeness, lines of code written, or adherence to detailed project plans. Rather than measuring success through abstract milestones or extensive paperwork, agile teams focus on delivering software that actually performs its intended functions.

This approach provides immediate value to stakeholders and customers, who can interact with working features and provide feedback based on actual functionality rather than theoretical specifications. Working software eliminates ambiguity about project status â€“ either the features work as intended or they don't. This binary nature of functionality creates clarity that documentation or progress reports cannot match.

The principle also encourages frequent delivery of incremental improvements, allowing teams to validate their understanding of requirements and make necessary adjustments early in the development process. When teams prioritize working software, they naturally focus on the most critical features first, ensuring that core functionality is established before moving to less essential components.

Furthermore, working software enables continuous testing and integration, revealing potential issues and dependencies that might remain hidden in planning documents. This real-time feedback loop accelerates problem-solving and reduces the risk of major system failures later in development.
