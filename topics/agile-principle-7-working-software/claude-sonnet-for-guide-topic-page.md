# Agile principle 7: Working software

"Working software is the primary measure of progress."

Working software serves as the most tangible and meaningful indicator of project advancement in agile development. Unlike traditional methodologies that rely heavily on documentation milestones and planning phases, agile teams demonstrate progress through functional code that delivers value to users.

This principle transforms stakeholder conversations from abstract discussions about plans to concrete demonstrations of capability. When a development team shows a working login system, payment processing, or data visualization, stakeholders can immediately understand progress and provide meaningful feedback. The working software becomes the shared language between technical teams and business stakeholders, eliminating ambiguity about what has been accomplished and what value has been delivered to users.

Consider Spotify's development approach, where teams release small, working features continuously rather than waiting for comprehensive documentation. Their music recommendation algorithms weren't perfected through extensive design documents but through iterative releases that allowed real user feedback to shape improvements. Each working increment provided measurable progress toward better user experience.

Netflix exemplifies this principle through their A/B testing culture, where working software variations are deployed to different user segments. Rather than debating interface designs in meetings, they release functional prototypes and measure actual user engagement. A working recommendation interface that increases viewing time by 2% represents more concrete progress than detailed wireframes promising theoretical improvements.

Even in enterprise software, companies like Atlassian demonstrate progress through working Jira or Confluence features rather than extensive requirement specifications. When they introduced collaborative editing, progress was measured by functional collaboration tools that teams could actually use, not by documentation describing how collaboration might work.
