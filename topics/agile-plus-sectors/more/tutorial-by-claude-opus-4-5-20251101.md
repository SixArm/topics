- **Customer onboarding**: Process improvement teams map and optimize customer journeys using lean principles

### Sector-Specific Adaptations

| Traditional Finance | Agile Finance |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Annual release cycles | Bi-weekly or monthly production releases |
| Waterfall compliance projects | Integrated compliance within sprint work |
| Separate business and IT | Embedded product owners from business lines |
| Post-launch audits | Continuous compliance validation |

### Challenges and Considerations

Financial services face stringent regulatory oversight requiring extensive documentation and audit trails. Security concerns demand careful change management. Agile implementations must incorporate regulatory requirements as first-class backlog items rather than afterthoughts. Many organizations adopt SAFe or other scaled frameworks to coordinate across large portfolios while maintaining compliance.

## Government Sector

Government agencies apply agile to improve citizen services, modernize legacy systems, and deliver public value more efficiently despite bureaucratic constraints.

### Key Applications

- **Digital services**: Agencies build citizen-facing portals and applications using iterative development
- **Legacy modernization**: Large-scale system replacements use agile to reduce risk through incremental migration
- **Policy implementation**: Cross-agency teams apply agile to complex policy rollouts
- **Procurement reform**: Progressive acquisition strategies enable agile contracting

### Sector-Specific Adaptations

| Traditional Government | Agile Government |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| Multi-year waterfall contracts | Modular contracting with iterative deliverables |
| Requirements defined years in advance | Discovery sprints to validate assumptions |
| Vendor-managed development | Integrated government-vendor teams |
| Big-bang deployments | Continuous delivery with feature flags |

### Challenges and Considerations

Government procurement traditionally favors fixed-price contracts with detailed specifications, conflicting with agile's adaptive nature. Budget cycles operate annually, creating tension with continuous funding models. Successful government agile requires executive sponsorship, procurement reform, and cultural change. The U.S. Digital Service and 18F have demonstrated effective patterns for agile in federal contexts.

## Healthcare Sector

Healthcare organizations leverage agile to improve patient outcomes, streamline clinical workflows, and accelerate medical technology development while maintaining rigorous safety standards.

### Key Applications

- **Electronic health records**: Development teams iterate on EHR features based on clinician feedback
- **Medical devices**: Device manufacturers use agile within regulated development frameworks
- **Clinical process improvement**: Lean healthcare applies continuous improvement to patient care workflows
- **Telehealth platforms**: Rapid iteration enables healthcare providers to expand virtual care capabilities

### Sector-Specific Adaptations

| Traditional Healthcare IT | Agile Healthcare IT |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Vendor-driven implementations | Clinician-centered design with embedded clinical product owners |
| Annual upgrade cycles | Continuous delivery with staged rollouts by department |
| Compliance as gate review | Integrated regulatory validation within sprints |
| IT-managed priorities | Clinical leadership drives backlog prioritization |

### Challenges and Considerations

Patient safety requirements demand rigorous validation that can extend sprint cycles. HIPAA and other regulations require documentation and security controls. Medical device development must satisfy FDA requirements, often necessitating hybrid approaches that incorporate agile within compliant frameworks like IEC 62304. Clinical staff availability for feedback sessions is limited, requiring creative engagement strategies.

## Manufacturing Sector

Manufacturing companies apply agile principles to product development, supply chain optimization, and operational excellence, blending with established lean manufacturing practices.
