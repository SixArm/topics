# Agile Meetings: Tutorial

## Overview

Agile meetings differ from traditional meetings in a fundamental way: they prioritize active engagement and collective problem-solving over passive information consumption. Rather than one-way presentations, agile meetings bring participants together to make decisions, solve problems, and align on next steps.

## The Problem with Traditional Meetings

Traditional meetings often follow a broadcast model: one person presents, others listen. This approach:

- Wastes the collective intelligence of participants
- Creates passive attendees who disengage
- Could be replaced by an email or recorded video
- Fails to generate the collaborative outcomes that justify gathering people together

## Agile Meeting Principles

### Preparation Is Essential

Participants arrive prepared with relevant context, having reviewed necessary materials beforehand. Meeting time is spent on higher-value activities—analysis, discussion, and decision-making—rather than on information transfer that could happen asynchronously.

### Active Participation

Every participant contributes. Meetings are structured to draw out multiple perspectives and collective intelligence. If someone does not need to participate, they should not be in the meeting.

### Focus on Outcomes

Every meeting should have a clear purpose and produce tangible outcomes—decisions made, actions assigned, blockers identified, or plans agreed upon.

### Time-Boxing

Meetings have fixed durations and stick to them. This forces prioritization of the most important topics and prevents discussion from expanding to fill available time.

## The Thayer Method

The Thayer method transforms meetings by shifting from "What should we present?" to "What should we work on together?" Key elements:

- Participants study materials before the meeting
- Everyone arrives with foundational knowledge
- Meeting time is dedicated to analysis, discussion, and decision-making
- The group's collective intelligence is applied to problems rather than spent absorbing information

## Common Agile Meetings

### Daily Standup
- **Purpose**: Synchronize the team, identify blockers
- **Duration**: 15 minutes maximum
- **Format**: Each person answers: What did I do? What will I do? What is blocking me?
- **Key**: This is a coordination meeting, not a status report

### Sprint Planning
- **Purpose**: Select and plan work for the upcoming sprint
- **Duration**: Proportional to sprint length (typically 2-4 hours for a two-week sprint)
- **Format**: Review sprint goal, select backlog items, discuss approach
- **Key**: Both business and technical team members participate

### Sprint Review
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate working software and gather feedback
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours for a two-week sprint
- **Format**: Live demo of completed work, stakeholder feedback
- **Key**: This is a feedback session, not a presentation

### Retrospective
- **Purpose**: Reflect on the process and identify improvements
- **Duration**: 1-1.5 hours for a two-week sprint
- **Format**: Discuss what went well, what could improve, and commit to action items
- **Key**: Psychological safety is essential for honest reflection

### Backlog Refinement
- **Purpose**: Clarify and prepare upcoming backlog items
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours per week
- **Format**: Discuss stories, split large items, add acceptance criteria, estimate
- **Key**: Ensures stories meet the Definition of Ready before sprint planning

## Practical Steps

1. **Define a clear purpose for every meeting**: If you cannot state the purpose in one sentence, reconsider whether the meeting is needed.
2. **Require preparation**: Distribute materials in advance and expect participants to arrive ready to contribute.
3. **Time-box strictly**: End meetings on time. Unfinished topics carry over to follow-up sessions or asynchronous channels.
4. **Minimize attendance**: Include only people who need to participate. Others can receive notes or recordings.
5. **Produce outcomes**: End every meeting with documented decisions, action items with owners, or clearly stated next steps.

## Key Takeaway

The purpose of agile meetings is collaborative work, not information broadcast. Prepare before, participate during, and produce outcomes after. Every meeting should justify the time of every person in the room by generating results that could not be achieved asynchronously.
