# Agile meetings

Traditional meetings often focus on presentations where participants passively receive information, but modern collaborative approaches emphasize active engagement and collective problem-solving.

* **Agile methodologies** demonstrate how this approach works in practice. Team members come prepared with their current work context and focus on identifying blockers, making decisions, and planning next steps together. The emphasis is on collective intelligence and shared ownership of outcomes.

* **The Thayer method** similarly transforms meetings by shifting from "What should we present?" to "What should we work on together?". Participants study materials beforehand, coming prepared with foundational knowledge that allows the meeting time to be dedicated to higher-value activities like analysis, discussion, and decision-making. This preparation ensures everyone arrives with a common baseline understanding, enabling more productive collaboration.

Agile methodologies and the Thayer method both prioritize the most valuable use of group time for action, multiple perspectives, creative thinking, and collaboration-building. When participants arrive prepared, meetings become laboratories for innovation and problem-solving rather than information broadcasting sessions. The impact is maximizing engagement then progress.
