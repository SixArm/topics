  <p>To prioritize collective problem-solving and active engagement over passive information receiving</p>
  <p>Agile meetings shift the focus from presentations where participants passively receive information to active engagement and collective problem-solving. Both agile methodologies and approaches like the Thayer method emphasize that participants arrive prepared, enabling meetings to become laboratories for innovation, decision-making, and collaboration rather than information broadcasting sessions.</p>
