  <p>To proactively track potential risks, required actions, current issues, and key decisions in a central location</p>
  <p>A RAID log serves as a centralized document that enables project managers to proactively identify potential risks and take steps to mitigate them before they become major issues. It tracks all four components—Risks, Actions, Issues, and Decisions—ensuring nothing falls through the cracks and providing a communication tool for keeping stakeholders informed about project progress and concerns.</p>
