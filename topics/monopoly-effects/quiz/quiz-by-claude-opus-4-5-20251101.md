  <p>Reduced incentive for research, development, and innovation</p>
  <p>When a company holds a monopoly, it has no competitive pressure to improve its products or services. Without competition driving the need to differentiate or stay ahead, the dominant company has little motivation to invest in R&D or create new innovations. This leads to market stagnation, limited consumer choices, and outdated technology offerings.</p>
