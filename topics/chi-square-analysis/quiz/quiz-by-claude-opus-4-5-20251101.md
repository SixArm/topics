  <p>Whether there is a significant association between the variables</p>
  <p>Chi-square analysis is a statistical method specifically designed to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It compares observed frequencies in a contingency table against expected frequencies calculated under the assumption of no association. If the chi-square test statistic is large enough to reject the null hypothesis, we can conclude there is evidence of an association between the variables.</p>
