  <p>It encrypts a victim's files and demands payment for decryption</p>
  <p>Ransomware is a specific type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, rendering them inaccessible, and then demands payment (typically in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key. This extortion-based approach differentiates it from other malware types like adware (which displays ads), worms (which self-propagate), or spyware (which monitors and steals data).</p>
