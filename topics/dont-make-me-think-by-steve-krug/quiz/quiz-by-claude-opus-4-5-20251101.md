  <p>Creating interfaces so intuitive that users don't need to think or make unnecessary decisions</p>
  <p>The core principle of Krug's book is that websites should be self-evident and require minimal cognitive effort from users. Good usability means users can accomplish their goals without having to stop and figure out how the interface works. This is achieved through clear visual hierarchy, intuitive navigation, concise communication, and eliminating unnecessary clutter.</p>
