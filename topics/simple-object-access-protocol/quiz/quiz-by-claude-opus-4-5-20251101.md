  <p>It works across different programming languages, platforms, and communication protocols using standardized XML</p>
  <p>SOAP's main benefit is its interoperability - it uses a standardized XML format that can be parsed by any system supporting XML, and it supports multiple transport protocols (HTTP, SMTP, TCP/IP), making it versatile for integrating diverse systems regardless of their underlying platform or programming language.</p>
