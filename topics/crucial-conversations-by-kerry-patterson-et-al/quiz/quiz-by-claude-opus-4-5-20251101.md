  <p>High stakes, strong emotions, and differing opinions</p>
  <p>The authors define a crucial conversation as one where there are high stakes, strong emotions, and differing opinions. These conversations are difficult to navigate because they often involve sensitive or controversial topics that people feel strongly about. Understanding this definition helps technology professionals recognize when they are entering a crucial conversation—such as during project disputes, performance discussions, or technical disagreements—and apply the book's framework for productive, respectful dialogue.</p>
