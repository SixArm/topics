  <p>To map out the path a user takes to complete a task, identifying pain points and areas for improvement</p>
  <p>A user journey is a visual representation of the steps a user goes through when interacting with a product or service. Its primary purpose is to help designers and developers understand the user's experience—including their actions, thoughts, emotions, and pain points—so they can create user-focused products that meet the needs of their intended audience.</p>
