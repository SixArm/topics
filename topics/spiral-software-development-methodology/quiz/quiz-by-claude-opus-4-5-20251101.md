# Spiral software development methodology

Question: What is the primary distinguishing characteristic of the spiral software development methodology that sets it apart from other development approaches?

- [ ] It eliminates the need for planning phases by focusing solely on rapid prototyping
- [ ] It uses a risk-driven approach with continuous risk assessment and mitigation throughout development
- [ ] It strictly follows a linear sequence of phases without any iteration
- [ ] It requires completing all documentation before any coding begins

  <p>It uses a risk-driven approach with continuous risk assessment and mitigation throughout development</p>
  <p>The spiral methodology, developed by Barry Boehm in 1986, is fundamentally a risk-driven approach that combines elements of waterfall and iterative development. Its defining feature is the continuous identification and mitigation of potential risks through repeated cycles containing four phases: planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. This focus on risk management allows teams to prevent costly problems from emerging later in development and makes the methodology particularly suitable for large, complex, and high-risk projects.</p>
