  <p>It allows you to gain an advantage and stay ahead by responding more quickly to changing circumstances</p>
  <p>The OODA loop, developed by military strategist John Boyd, emphasizes speed, flexibility, and agility in decision-making. The goal is to move through the observe-orient-decide-act cycle faster than the competition, enabling you to adapt to new challenges, respond to changing market conditions, and maintain a strategic advantage—particularly critical in crisis situations where quick decisions can determine success or survival.</p>
