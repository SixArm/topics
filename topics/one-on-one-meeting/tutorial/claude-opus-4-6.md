# One-on-one meeting

A one-on-one meeting is a recurring, private conversation between a manager and an individual team member, designed to maintain alignment, build trust, and support professional growth. In technology organizations, where work is often complex, fast-moving, and distributed across teams, the one-on-one is one of the most important rituals a manager can establish. Unlike status meetings or standups that focus on project updates, the one-on-one is the employee's meeting — a dedicated space to surface concerns, discuss career development, exchange feedback, and strengthen the working relationship between a manager and a direct report.

## Why one-on-one meetings matter

One-on-one meetings serve a fundamentally different purpose than team meetings, sprint reviews, or all-hands gatherings. They provide a private channel for topics that are difficult or inappropriate to raise in group settings — career aspirations, interpersonal friction, workload concerns, or candid feedback about organizational direction.

For technology professionals specifically, one-on-ones are critical because:

- **Technical work is often ambiguous.** Engineers and designers frequently encounter blockers, architectural trade-offs, or scope questions that benefit from a manager's broader context.
- **Burnout is prevalent.** Regular check-ins allow managers to detect early signs of fatigue, disengagement, or unsustainable pace before they escalate.
- **Career paths are nonlinear.** Tech professionals may want to move between individual contributor and management tracks, shift domains, or pursue specializations. One-on-ones provide the venue to discuss these aspirations.
- **Retention depends on relationships.** Research consistently shows that people leave managers, not companies. A strong one-on-one habit is one of the most effective retention tools available.

## Cadence and duration

Choosing the right frequency and length depends on the experience level of the employee, the complexity of the work, and the size of the team.

| Cadence | Duration | Best suited for |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly | 25-30 minutes | New hires, junior engineers, employees in transition, high-change environments |
| Biweekly | 30-45 minutes | Experienced individual contributors, stable teams, established working relationships |
| Monthly | 45-60 minutes | Senior staff, long-tenured employees with high autonomy, skip-level meetings |

Weekly cadence is the default recommendation for most technology teams. Biweekly meetings often drift into status updates because there is too much ground to cover. Monthly meetings risk becoming too infrequent to catch issues early. When in doubt, start weekly and adjust based on mutual agreement.

## Ownership and agenda

The one-on-one belongs to the employee, not the manager. The employee should drive the agenda, bringing the topics that matter most to them. The manager's role is to listen, coach, and remove obstacles — not to run a status check.

A practical approach is to maintain a shared document (a running Google Doc, Notion page, or similar) where both parties can add agenda items throughout the week. This prevents the meeting from starting with an awkward "so, what do you want to talk about?" and ensures that important topics are not forgotten.

Effective agenda topics include:

- **Blockers and frustrations** — what is slowing the employee down or causing stress
- **Feedback in both directions** — what the manager can do better, what the employee needs to improve
- **Career development** — skills to build, projects to pursue, promotion readiness
- **Team and organizational concerns** — dynamics, process, culture issues
- **Personal well-being** — workload balance, energy levels, motivation
- **Recognition** — recent wins worth acknowledging

Topics to avoid or minimize in one-on-ones include detailed project status updates (use standups or async tools for this), task assignment, and meeting scheduling logistics.

## Manager responsibilities

The manager's effectiveness in one-on-ones depends on a few key behaviors:

- **Active listening.** Resist the urge to solve every problem immediately. Ask clarifying questions. Reflect back what you hear. Sometimes the employee needs to think out loud, not receive a directive.
- **Consistent follow-through.** If you commit to an action item — escalating a concern, investigating a policy, connecting the employee with a mentor — do it before the next meeting. Broken commitments erode trust quickly.
- **Candid feedback.** Do not save critical feedback for performance reviews. One-on-ones are the right venue for timely, specific, and constructive feedback. Use the SBI framework (Situation, Behavior, Impact) to keep feedback actionable.
- **Psychological safety.** Make it clear through actions, not just words, that the employee can raise difficult topics without retaliation. This means responding to bad news with curiosity rather than blame.
- **Note-taking.** Keep brief, private notes after each meeting. These are invaluable for tracking patterns, remembering commitments, and writing accurate performance reviews.

## Employee responsibilities

Employees get more value from one-on-ones when they take an active role:

- **Prepare in advance.** Add items to the shared agenda throughout the week rather than trying to remember everything five minutes before the meeting.
- **Be honest.** The meeting only works if you are willing to surface real concerns. Saying "everything is fine" when it is not wastes both people's time.
- **Ask for what you need.** Whether it is a stretch assignment, a conference budget, or help navigating a conflict with a colleague, the one-on-one is the right place to make the request.
- **Give upward feedback.** Managers need feedback too, and most receive far too little of it. If something about the team's process, communication style, or priorities is not working, say so.

## Common anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it is harmful | What to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Canceling frequently | Signals that the employee is not a priority; erodes trust | Reschedule rather than cancel; protect the time on your calendar |
| Status-update-only meetings | Misses the opportunity for deeper conversation; can be done asynchronously | Reserve one-on-ones for topics that require dialogue, not reporting |
| Manager monologues | Shuts down employee voice; defeats the purpose of the meeting | Let the employee speak first and speak more; aim for a 70/30 listening ratio |
| Skipping difficult conversations | Allows problems to fester; prevents growth | Address issues promptly using specific examples and a coaching mindset |
| No follow-up on action items | Demonstrates that the meeting has no real impact | Track commitments in a shared document and review them at the start of the next meeting |
| Treating the meeting as optional for senior people | Even experienced employees benefit from regular connection | Adjust cadence but do not eliminate the meeting entirely |

## One-on-ones for remote and distributed teams

For technology teams that work remotely or across time zones, one-on-ones take on additional importance because there are fewer opportunities for the informal hallway conversations that naturally surface concerns in an office.

Best practices for remote one-on-ones include:

- **Use video when possible.** Non-verbal cues matter. Camera-on is a reasonable default for one-on-ones even if the team norm is camera-off for larger meetings.
- **Start with a genuine check-in.** Remote work can be isolating. A brief personal check-in ("how are you actually doing?") is not small talk — it is management.
- **Be mindful of time zones.** Rotate meeting times if there is a significant time zone difference so the same person is not always taking the early or late call.
- **Supplement with asynchronous communication.** Use the shared agenda document for items that do not require real-time discussion, and reserve the synchronous time for topics that benefit from dialogue.

## Skip-level one-on-ones

A skip-level one-on-one is a meeting between an employee and their manager's manager. These meetings serve a different purpose than direct-manager one-on-ones:

- They give senior leaders visibility into team health, culture, and concerns that may not surface through the management chain.
- They give employees a relationship with leadership beyond their direct manager.
- They provide a safety valve if the employee has concerns about their direct manager that they cannot raise in their regular one-on-one.

Skip-level meetings are typically held monthly or quarterly and should be framed as a listening exercise for the senior leader, not a performance evaluation.

## Summary

The one-on-one meeting is the single most important recurring commitment a manager makes to each direct report. It is not a status meeting, not a performance review, and not a casual chat — it is a structured, private conversation that builds trust, surfaces problems early, supports career growth, and strengthens the manager-employee relationship. The employee owns the agenda, the manager owns the follow-through, and both parties share responsibility for making the time productive and honest. For technology teams operating in complex, fast-changing environments, a consistent one-on-one practice is the difference between a manager who is informed and effective and one who is perpetually surprised by attrition, burnout, and misalignment.
