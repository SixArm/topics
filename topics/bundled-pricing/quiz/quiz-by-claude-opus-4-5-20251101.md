  <p>Pure bundling sells only the bundle with no individual purchase option, while mixed bundling allows customers to buy items individually or as a bundle</p>
  <p>Pure bundling means customers can only purchase the complete bundle—individual items are not available separately. Mixed bundling provides flexibility by letting customers choose between buying the bundle at a discounted price or purchasing individual items separately. This distinction is critical for technology professionals when designing pricing strategies, as it affects customer choice, market segmentation, and revenue optimization.</p>
