  <p>It uses creative, unconventional, and low-cost tactics to generate buzz</p>
  <p>Guerilla marketing is defined by its use of unexpected, unconventional, and often ambush-style tactics that don't rely on large marketing budgets. Unlike traditional marketing that depends on paid advertising, guerilla marketing aims to create memorable impressions through non-traditional means such as stunts, street art, viral content, and product sampling—making it particularly valuable for startups and smaller businesses with limited resources.</p>
