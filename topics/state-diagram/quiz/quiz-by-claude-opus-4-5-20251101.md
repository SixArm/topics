  <p>To describe the behavior of an object or system over time through states, events, and transitions</p>
  <p>A state diagram (also called a state machine diagram or state chart diagram) is a behavioral diagram that graphically represents the states an object or system can exist in, the events that trigger changes, and the transitions between those states. This makes it essential for modeling dynamic system behavior, such as a traffic light cycling through Red, Yellow, and Green states based on timer events.</p>
