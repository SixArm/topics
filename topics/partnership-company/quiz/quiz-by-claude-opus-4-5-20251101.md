  <p>In an LLP, all partners have limited liability for business debts and legal issues</p>
  <p>In a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), all partners have limited liability protection, meaning their personal assets are shielded from the company's debts and legal issues. This contrasts with a general partnership, where all partners share equal liability for the business's debts and legal matters. LLPs are commonly used by professionals such as lawyers, accountants, and architects who want partnership flexibility while protecting personal assets.</p>
