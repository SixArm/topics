  <p>To define scope, identify stakeholders, establish goals, and create a high-level plan</p>
  <p>The inception phase (also known as project initiation) sets the foundation for the entire project. During this phase, the team defines the project scope, identifies key stakeholders, establishes goals and objectives, creates a high-level plan, and identifies potential risks, dependencies, and constraints. This phase typically concludes with a project charter that serves as a roadmap for the project before moving into the planning phase.</p>
