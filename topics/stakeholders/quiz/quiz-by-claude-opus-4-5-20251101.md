  <p>Primary stakeholders have a direct stake in the company (e.g., employees, customers), while secondary stakeholders are indirectly impacted (e.g., local community, government agencies)</p>
  <p>The distinction between primary and secondary stakeholders is based on the directness of their relationship with the organization. Primary stakeholders have a direct stake and are immediately affected by the company's operations (such as employees and customers), while secondary stakeholders are indirectly impacted by the company's activities (such as the local community and government agencies). This distinction is important for prioritizing stakeholder engagement and communication strategies.</p>
