  <p>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</p>
  <p>An LLC combines the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership. Unlike a C-Corporation (which pays corporate income tax and then shareholders pay tax on dividends), an LLC is not taxed as a separate entity—instead, profits pass through to the owners who report them on their personal tax returns. Unlike a general partnership, LLC owners have limited liability protection, meaning they are not personally responsible for the business's debts and obligations.</p>
