# Company legal entities

Choosing the right legal entity is one of the most consequential decisions a technology founder or business leader will make. The legal structure determines how the company is taxed, how liability is distributed among owners, how capital can be raised, and how governance is organized. Each entity type carries distinct advantages and trade-offs that affect everything from day-to-day operations to long-term exit strategy.

## Why legal entity selection matters

The legal entity you choose shapes your company in several fundamental ways:

- **Liability protection**: Whether founders and owners are personally responsible for company debts, lawsuits, and obligations.
- **Taxation**: Whether the business is taxed at the corporate level, the individual level, or both.
- **Capital raising**: Whether the company can issue stock, attract venture capital, or bring in investors through other mechanisms.
- **Governance and management**: The formality of decision-making structures, board requirements, and reporting obligations.
- **Transferability of ownership**: How easily ownership interests can be bought, sold, or transferred.

For technology professionals in particular, the choice of entity has direct implications for equity compensation, stock option pools, investor expectations, and acquisition or IPO readiness.

## C-Corporation

A C-Corporation (C-Corp) is a legal entity that exists as a separate legal person from its owners, known as shareholders. It can own assets, enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and conduct business in its own name. The C-Corp is the dominant structure for venture-backed technology companies and publicly traded firms.

C-Corporations are subject to what is often called "double taxation." The corporation pays corporate income tax on its profits at the entity level. When those profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends, the shareholders are taxed again on their personal tax returns. Despite this, C-Corps remain popular because of their ability to issue multiple classes of stock, which is essential for venture capital financing.

Key characteristics of a C-Corporation:

- Offers limited liability protection to shareholders, meaning personal assets are shielded from corporate debts and obligations.
- Can issue common stock, preferred stock, and stock options, making it ideal for employee equity compensation plans.
- Has a formal governance structure with a board of directors, officers, and shareholder meetings.
- Has no limit on the number of shareholders.
- Is the required structure for companies seeking an initial public offering (IPO).

## Limited Liability Company (LLC)

A Limited Liability Company (LLC) combines the liability protection of a corporation with the tax flexibility of a partnership. The LLC is a separate legal entity from its owners (called members), but by default it is not taxed at the entity level. Instead, profits and losses pass through to the members' personal tax returns, avoiding double taxation.

LLCs are popular among small technology firms, consulting practices, freelancers, and bootstrapped startups. They are relatively easy to form and maintain, with fewer compliance requirements than a corporation. LLCs also offer significant flexibility in how ownership, profit-sharing, and management responsibilities are structured through an operating agreement.

Key characteristics of an LLC:

- Provides limited liability protection to members, shielding personal assets from business debts.
- Offers pass-through taxation by default, though an LLC can elect to be taxed as a C-Corp or S-Corp.
- Allows flexible management structures; can be member-managed or manager-managed.
- Cannot issue stock, which makes raising venture capital more difficult.
- Does not require a board of directors or formal meeting minutes.

## Partnership

A partnership is formed when two or more individuals or entities agree to carry on a business together for profit. Partnerships come in two primary forms: general partnerships and limited partnerships.

In a **general partnership**, all partners share management authority and are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. This means any single partner can be held personally responsible for the full amount of a business debt, regardless of their ownership share.

In a **limited partnership (LP)**, there are two classes of partners. General partners manage the business and carry unlimited personal liability. Limited partners contribute capital and share in profits but do not participate in management and have liability limited to the amount of their investment. Limited partnerships are commonly used as the legal structure for venture capital funds and private equity funds.

Partnerships are not taxed at the entity level. Instead, income and losses pass through to the partners' individual tax returns.

## Comparison of entity types

| Feature | C-Corporation | LLC | General Partnership | Limited Partnership |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Limited liability | Yes, for all shareholders | Yes, for all members | No; partners have unlimited liability | Yes, for limited partners only |
| Taxation | Double taxation (corporate and personal) | Pass-through by default | Pass-through | Pass-through |
| Can issue stock | Yes | No | No | No |
| Venture capital friendly | Yes | Rarely | No | Used as fund structure |
| Governance formality | High (board, officers, minutes) | Low to moderate | Low | Moderate |
| Ease of formation | Moderate | Easy | Easy | Moderate |
| Number of owners | Unlimited | Unlimited | Two or more | Two or more (at least one general and one limited) |
| Ownership transferability | High (shares are transferable) | Restricted (depends on operating agreement) | Restricted (requires partner consent) | Moderate (limited partnership interests may be transferable) |

## Choosing the right entity for a technology company

The decision depends on the company's goals, funding strategy, and stage of growth:

- **Venture-backed startups** almost universally incorporate as C-Corporations, typically in Delaware. This structure supports preferred stock issuance, employee stock option plans (ESOPs), and the expectations of institutional investors.
- **Bootstrapped startups and small teams** often choose an LLC for its simplicity, pass-through taxation, and liability protection. If the company later seeks venture funding, it can convert from an LLC to a C-Corp.
- **Consulting firms and professional services** frequently operate as LLCs or partnerships, where pass-through taxation and flexible profit-sharing are more important than the ability to raise equity capital.
- **Investment funds** such as venture capital and private equity funds are typically structured as limited partnerships, with the fund managers serving as general partners and the investors as limited partners.

## Additional entity types worth noting

Beyond the three most common structures, technology professionals may encounter several other entity types:

- **S-Corporation**: A tax election available to qualifying corporations (100 or fewer shareholders, all U.S. citizens or residents, single class of stock). S-Corps provide pass-through taxation while maintaining the corporate structure. They are less common in high-growth technology companies because of the shareholder limitations.
- **B-Corporation (Benefit Corporation)**: A for-profit entity that includes a legal mandate to consider the impact of decisions on stakeholders beyond shareholders, such as employees, community, and the environment. Some states have specific benefit corporation statutes.
- **Sole Proprietorship**: An unincorporated business owned by a single individual. It offers no liability protection and is taxed as personal income. It is the simplest structure but carries the most personal risk.
- **Nonprofit Corporation**: A corporation organized for purposes other than profit. Nonprofits can apply for tax-exempt status and are governed by a board of directors. Some technology organizations, particularly those focused on open-source projects or public interest technology, operate as nonprofits.

## Summary

Selecting the appropriate legal entity is a foundational decision that affects liability exposure, tax treatment, governance obligations, and the ability to raise capital. C-Corporations are the standard for venture-backed technology startups due to their stock issuance capabilities and investor familiarity. LLCs offer simplicity and tax flexibility for smaller or bootstrapped ventures. Partnerships serve well for professional services firms and as the structure for investment funds. Understanding the trade-offs among these entity types enables technology professionals to make informed decisions that align with their business objectives, growth trajectory, and risk tolerance.
