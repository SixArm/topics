  <p>Income Approach, Market Approach, and Asset Approach</p>
  <p>The three typical approaches to valuation are: the Income Approach (estimating present value of future cash flows), the Market Approach (comparing to similar assets or companies recently sold), and the Asset Approach (adding up individual asset values minus liabilities). Methods like DCF, CCA, and PTA are specific frameworks within these broader approaches.</p>
