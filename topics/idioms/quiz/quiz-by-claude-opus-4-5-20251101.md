  <p>Idioms have meanings different from the literal meanings of their individual words</p>
  <p>Idioms are phrases or expressions whose meaning cannot be understood by simply translating the individual words. For example, "barking up the wrong tree" means pursuing a mistaken course of action—a meaning that cannot be derived from the literal words "barking" and "tree." This is why idioms can be challenging for non-native speakers who may try to interpret them word by word rather than understanding them through usage and context.</p>
