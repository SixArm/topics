  <p>Build projects around motivated individuals, give them environment and support, and trust them to get the job done</p>
  <p>Agile Principle 5 states that motivated individuals are the cornerstone of successful projects. Rather than micromanagement or rigid processes, this principle emphasizes providing teams with the tools, resources, and autonomy they need, then trusting them to make decisions about how best to accomplish their work. When team members feel trusted, they respond with higher levels of ownership, creativity, and commitment to quality.</p>
