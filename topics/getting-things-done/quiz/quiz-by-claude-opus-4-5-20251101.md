  <p>Capture, Clarify, Organize, Reflect, Engage</p>
  <p>David Allen's GTD methodology follows these five sequential steps: Capture (collect all tasks and ideas in a trusted system), Clarify (determine desired outcomes and next actions), Organize (categorize tasks into appropriate lists like Next Actions, Waiting For, and Projects), Reflect (regularly review and update the system), and Engage (take action based on priorities and context). Understanding this workflow is essential for technology professionals managing complex projects and multiple commitments.</p>
