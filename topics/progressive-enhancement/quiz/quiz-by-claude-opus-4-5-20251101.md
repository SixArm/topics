  <p>Delivering a basic functional experience to all users, then adding enhanced features for more capable devices</p>
  <p>Progressive enhancement starts with a core, functional experience that works for everyone regardless of their device or browser capabilities. Enhanced features like advanced styling, interactivity, and animations are then layered on top for users with more capable devices. This approach ensures accessibility, device independence, and flexibility while maintaining usability for all users.</p>
