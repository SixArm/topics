# Disaster Recovery Testing

Question: What are the two key metrics that automated disaster recovery testing measures to evaluate an organization's recovery capabilities?

- [ ] Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
- [ ] Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- [ ] Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Service Level Objective (SLO)
- [ ] Uptime Percentage and Availability Zone Coverage

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</p>
  <p>RTO defines the maximum acceptable time to restore systems after a disaster, while RPO defines the maximum acceptable data loss measured in time. Automated disaster recovery testing measures these objectives to identify bottlenecks or failures before actual disasters occur, providing organizations with quantifiable metrics to continuously improve their recovery procedures.</p>
