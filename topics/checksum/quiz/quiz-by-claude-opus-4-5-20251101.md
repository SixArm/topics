# Checksum

Question: What is the primary purpose of a checksum?

- [ ] To compress data for faster transmission over networks
- [ ] To encrypt data to prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] To verify data integrity and detect errors or changes
- [ ] To recover corrupted files from storage media

  <p>To verify data integrity and detect errors or changes</p>
  <p>A checksum is a value calculated from a set of data using a mathematical algorithm (such as a hash function or CRC). By comparing the checksum of received or stored data against the original checksum, you can determine whether the data has been altered, corrupted, or modified during transmission or storage. Checksums do not compress, encrypt, or recover data—they simply detect whether changes have occurred.</p>
