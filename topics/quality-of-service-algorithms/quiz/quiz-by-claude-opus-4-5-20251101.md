# Quality of Service (QoS) algorithms

Question: What is the primary purpose of Quality of Service (QoS) algorithms in network environments?

- [ ] To encrypt all network traffic for security purposes
- [ ] To increase the physical bandwidth capacity of network hardware
- [ ] To prioritize, manage, and control network traffic to ensure better service delivery when multiple applications share the same infrastructure
- [ ] To replace TCP/IP protocols with faster alternatives

  <p>To prioritize, manage, and control network traffic to ensure better service delivery when multiple applications share the same infrastructure</p>
  <p>QoS algorithms are essential in telecommunications to prioritize, manage, and control network traffic. This allows for better service delivery, especially in environments where multiple applications with different requirements—such as voice, video, and data—share the same network infrastructure. QoS mechanisms include traffic shaping, prioritization, queue management, admission control, and congestion avoidance.</p>
