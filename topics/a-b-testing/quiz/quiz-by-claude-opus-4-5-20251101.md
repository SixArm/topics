  <p>To compare two versions of an application or feature to determine which performs better</p>
  <p>A/B testing is a data-driven technique that compares two versions of an application or feature by systematically testing different variations against each other. This enables development teams to make objective decisions based on metrics such as conversion rates, user engagement, and performance, rather than relying on assumptions or opinions.</p>
