  <p>To validate assumptions and gather user feedback with minimal resources</p>
  <p>The fundamental purpose of an MVP is to quickly test ideas by getting a basic version of the product into users' hands. This approach allows teams to validate their assumptions about user needs and gather real feedback for improvements, all while using minimal resources. The focus is on learning and iteration rather than building a complete or polished product from the start.</p>
