  <p>They may become complacent and fail to innovate, allowing competitors to catch up</p>
  <p>While a strong moat provides competitive advantages like higher profit margins and market share protection, over-reliance on it can lead to complacency. When companies stop innovating because they feel secure in their position, competitors have the opportunity to develop new technologies or approaches that erode the moat over time. This is why moats should be balanced with a continued focus on innovation and growth.</p>
