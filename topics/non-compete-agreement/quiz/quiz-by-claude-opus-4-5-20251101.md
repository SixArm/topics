  <p>To protect the company's business interests by restricting the employee's ability to work for competitors or start competing businesses</p>
  <p>Non-compete agreements are designed to protect a company's business interests by preventing employees from taking the knowledge, skills, and connections they gained during employment and using them to compete against their former employer—either by starting their own competing business or working for a competitor.</p>
