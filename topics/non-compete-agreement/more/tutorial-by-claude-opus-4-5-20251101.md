## Non-Compete Agreement

A non-compete agreement (NCA) is a legal contract between an employer and an employee that restricts the employee's ability to compete against the employer during and after the employment relationship ends. For technology professionals, these agreements carry significant implications for career mobility, compensation negotiations, and long-term professional planning.

## Purpose and Rationale

Non-compete agreements serve several business purposes:

- **Protecting trade secrets**: Preventing employees from sharing proprietary algorithms, system architectures, or technical processes with competitors
- **Safeguarding client relationships**: Stopping employees from leveraging customer contacts built during employment
- **Preserving competitive advantage**: Ensuring investments in employee training and development don't directly benefit competitors
- **Retaining talent**: Creating friction against departures to rival companies

From an employer's perspective, a senior engineer who spent three years building a company's core platform represents a significant knowledge asset. The NCA attempts to prevent that knowledge from walking out the door and into a competitor's product.

## Key Components

| Component | Description | Typical Range for Tech |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Duration** | Time period restrictions remain active | 6 months to 2 years |
| **Geographic Scope** | Territory where restrictions apply | City, state, region, or nationwide |
| **Industry Scope** | Types of businesses covered | Direct competitors, adjacent markets |
| **Role Restrictions** | Specific positions prohibited | Similar technical or leadership roles |
| **Consideration** | What employee receives in exchange | Employment, bonus, equity, severance |

## Enforceability by State

Enforceability varies dramatically across U.S. jurisdictions. This directly affects technology professionals given the concentration of tech jobs in specific regions.

| State | Enforceability | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| **California** | Banned | Non-competes are void and unenforceable (except in limited business sale contexts) |
| **Colorado** | Highly restricted | Banned for workers earning under threshold; limited exceptions |
| **Washington** | Restricted | Income thresholds apply; presumption against enforcement |
| **Massachusetts** | Moderate | Garden leave or other consideration required; 12-month maximum |
| **Texas** | Generally enforceable | Must be ancillary to enforceable agreement with reasonable scope |
| **New York** | Case-by-case | Courts apply reasonableness test |
| **North Dakota** | Banned | Generally unenforceable |
| **Oklahoma** | Banned | Void except in business sale contexts |

## What Makes a Non-Compete Enforceable

Courts typically evaluate non-compete agreements using a reasonableness standard:

- **Legitimate business interest**: The employer must have something worth protecting beyond simply preventing competition
- **Reasonable duration**: Shorter time periods are more likely enforceable
- **Reasonable geographic scope**: Must match the actual competitive landscape
- **Not unduly burdensome**: Cannot effectively prevent the employee from working in their field
- **Adequate consideration**: The employee must receive something of value in exchange

## Red Flags for Technology Professionals

Watch for these problematic provisions:

- **Overly broad industry definitions**: "Any company that uses software" effectively bans you from the entire economy
- **Worldwide geographic scope**: Rarely necessary and often unenforceable
- **Excessive duration**: Anything beyond two years is suspect in fast-moving tech
- **No consideration**: Being asked to sign after already employed without additional compensation
- **Vague competitor definitions**: Ambiguity benefits employers in disputes
- **No carve-outs**: Legitimate agreements should exclude unrelated roles

## Negotiation Strategies

When presented with a non-compete, technology professionals have several options:

**Before Signing**
- Request removal of the non-compete entirely
- Negotiate a narrower list of specific named competitors
- Reduce the duration from two years to six months
- Limit geographic scope to markets where the company actually operates
- Add carve-outs for specific technologies, industries, or role types
- Request garden leave (paid time off during the restricted period)
- Negotiate additional equity or signing bonus as consideration

**At Departure**
- Request a written waiver from the employer
- Negotiate a shortened restriction period
- Obtain clarity on which specific companies are considered competitors
- Secure written confirmation of the company's interpretation

## Alternatives to Non-Competes

Employers increasingly use other mechanisms that may be more enforceable and targeted:

| Agreement Type | What It Covers | Enforceability |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Non-solicitation** | Prohibits recruiting former colleagues or clients | Generally more enforceable |
| **Non-disclosure (NDA)** | Protects confidential information | Highly enforceable for genuine trade secrets |
| **Invention assignment** | Company owns work created during employment | Standard and enforceable |
| **Garden leave** | Paid notice period before departure | Enforceable; benefits both parties |

## Federal Regulatory Landscape

The Federal Trade Commission proposed a rule in 2023 to ban non-compete clauses nationwide. While the rule faced legal challenges, it signals a broader policy trend against these agreements. Technology professionals should monitor:

- FTC rulemaking and enforcement actions
- State legislative changes (trend toward restriction)
- Court decisions narrowing enforceability
- Employer policy shifts in response to regulatory pressure

## Practical Considerations for Career Decisions

**When evaluating job offers:**
- Factor the non-compete into total compensation—it has real career cost
- Compare the non-compete scope to your intended career trajectory
- Consider whether the employer has a history of enforcing agreements
- Evaluate whether the role is worth the restrictions

**When leaving a position:**
- Review your agreement before job hunting
- Consult an employment attorney if the new role might trigger enforcement
- Document that you're not taking proprietary information
- Consider whether disclosure to your new employer is appropriate

## Key Takeaways

- Non-compete agreements are negotiable; don't assume terms are fixed
- Enforceability depends heavily on your state and the specific provisions
- California, Colorado, North Dakota, and Oklahoma offer the strongest protections for workers
- The trend in law and policy is toward restricting or banning non-competes
- Alternative agreements (NDAs, non-solicitation) often achieve employer goals with less career impact
- Always consult an employment attorney before signing or when changing jobs if you're bound by a non-compete

For technology professionals, understanding non-compete agreements is essential career management. These contracts can significantly constrain future opportunities, and the time to negotiate is before signing—not when you're ready to leave.
