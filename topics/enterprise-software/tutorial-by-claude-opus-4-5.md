## Enterprise Software

Enterprise software refers to a type of software designed for organizations or businesses to support their complex critical operations. This software provides a centralized platform for managing various functions such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), human resources management (HRM), and business intelligence (BI).

Enterprise software is typically used by large organizations and businesses to optimize workflows, improve collaboration, and enhance productivity.

## Core Categories of Enterprise Software

Enterprise software encompasses several major categories, each addressing distinct organizational needs:

| Category | Primary Purpose | Key Functions |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) | Integrate core business processes | Finance, accounting, HR, inventory, supply chain |
| CRM (Customer Relationship Management) | Manage customer interactions | Sales automation, marketing, customer service |
| SCM (Supply Chain Management) | Optimize supply chain operations | Inventory, order processing, logistics, procurement |
| HRM (Human Resources Management) | Manage workforce operations | Employee data, payroll, benefits, recruitment |
| BI (Business Intelligence) | Enable data-driven decisions | Analytics, reporting, data visualization |

## Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
