  <p>Brand value measures the financial worth derived from intangible factors like perceived value, customer loyalty, and market recognition</p>
  <p>Brand value represents the financial worth a brand brings beyond tangible assets, encompassing intangible elements such as brand equity (the value a brand brings to a business) and brand awareness (how well-known a brand is). For technology professionals, understanding this distinction is critical when evaluating acquisitions, partnerships, or competitive positioning—strong brand value can command premium pricing, attract talent, and create sustainable competitive advantages even when technical capabilities are comparable.</p>
