  <p>"The Mythical Man-Month" by Frederick P. Brooks Jr.</p>
  <p>Brooks's Law, introduced in this 1975 classic, states that adding more people to a late project only makes it later due to increased communication overhead, onboarding time, and coordination complexity. This insight revolutionized how managers think about resource allocation and remains one of the most cited principles in software project management.</p>
