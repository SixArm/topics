  <p>The spread or dispersion of data points around their mean</p>
  <p>Variance is a statistical measure that quantifies how far data points are spread out from the mean (average) value. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. A low variance indicates data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a high variance indicates greater spread.</p>
