  <p>It self-executes automatically when predetermined conditions are met</p>
  <p>A smart contract is a self-executing digital contract that automatically enforces and executes the terms of an agreement when predefined conditions (often called "if-then" statements) are met. This automation eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks, lawyers, or other third parties, which is the fundamental difference from traditional contracts that require manual verification and enforcement.</p>
