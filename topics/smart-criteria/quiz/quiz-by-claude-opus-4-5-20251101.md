  <p>SMART criteria is a framework for well-defined goal setting where goals must be Specific (clearly defined with no ambiguity), Measurable (with metrics to track progress), Achievable (realistic given available resources and timeframe), Relevant (aligned with broader objectives), and Timely (with a specific timeframe for completion). This framework helps ensure clearer communication and collaboration among team members.</p>
