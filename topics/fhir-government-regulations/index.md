# FHIR government regulations

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an industry standard, yet some organizations have been slow to fully adopt it. Government regulations aim to help.

United States:

- The 21st Century CURES Act requires health care organizations to provide API access to patient data.
- Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) creates a secure health information exchange.
- United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standardizes health data classes and data elements.
- FHIR supports USCDI: USCDI establishes the "patient information" and FHIR is how systems exchange it.
