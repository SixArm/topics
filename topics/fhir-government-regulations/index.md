# FHIR government regulations

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an industry standard, yet some organizations have been slow to fully adopt it. Government regulations aim to help.

United States:

- [The 21st Century Cures Act](../the-21st-century-cures-act/) requires health care organizations to provide API access to patient data.
- [Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA)](../trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement/) creates a secure health information exchange.
- [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](../health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act/) aims to help patient data security and secure sharing.
- [United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)](../united-states-core-data-for-interoperability/) standardizes health data classes and data elements.
- FHIR supports USCDI: USCDI establishes the "patient information" and FHIR is how systems exchange it.
