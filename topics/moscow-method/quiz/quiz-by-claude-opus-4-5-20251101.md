  <p>Won't</p>
  <p>In the MoSCoW method, "Won't" represents requirements that are explicitly excluded from the project scope. These are features or functionalities that have been deliberately identified as items that will not be developed or included in the current project. This category is crucial for managing stakeholder expectations and maintaining clear scope boundaries, distinguishing MoSCoW from methods that only prioritize what will be done rather than explicitly stating what won't.</p>
