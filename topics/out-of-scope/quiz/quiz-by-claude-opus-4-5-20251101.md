  <p>To indicate that a task or activity is not within the bounds of the current project or assignment</p>
  <p>Declaring something "out of scope" establishes clear boundaries for what is included in the current project. This doesn't mean the request is rejected permanently—it means it cannot be addressed within the existing project parameters. Clients or stakeholders can initiate a new project or change request to address out-of-scope items. This practice helps manage expectations, prevent scope creep, and maintain project timelines and budgets.</p>
