  <p>Agile becomes a rigid framework, contradicting its core principle of valuing individuals and interactions over processes and tools</p>
  <p>When teams become obsessed with perfect sprint execution and strict adherence to ceremonies, they can lose sight of agile's true purpose: delivering valuable software through collaboration and adaptability. This overemphasis transforms agile from a flexible approach into a rigid framework, which directly contradicts the Agile Manifesto's principle of valuing "individuals and interactions over processes and tools."</p>
