# Make value flow without interruptions

"Make value flow without interruptions" is Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) principle 6.

Lean Thinking says to ‘make value flow without
interruptions.’ Doing so requires an understanding of what flow is, what the
various properties of a flow system are, and how these properties can accelerate
or impede the flow of value through any particular system. Principle #6
highlights the eight common properties of a flow-based system and provides
specific recommendations for eliminating impediments to flow.
