  <p>The visual and aesthetic aspects of a product, such as shape, color, and texture</p>
  <p>Industrial design rights are a form of intellectual property that specifically protects the appearance of a product—including its shape, color, texture, and ornamentation—rather than its functionality, underlying technology, or brand identity. This protection helps prevent competitors from copying or imitating a design, builds brand recognition, and differentiates products in the marketplace.</p>
