# Agile vs Scrum

Agile and Scrum are often confused, but they represent different levels of software development methodology. Agile is a broad philosophy and set of principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto, emphasizing iterative development, customer collaboration, responding to change, and working software over comprehensive documentation. It's an umbrella term that encompasses various methodologies and practices focused on flexibility and rapid delivery.

Scrum, on the other hand, is a specific framework that implements Agile principles. It provides concrete structure through defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team), ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment). Scrum organizes work into time-boxed iterations called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks.

The key difference lies in scope and specificity. Agile is conceptual, offering guiding values and principles that can be applied across various contexts and industries. Scrum is tactical, providing a detailed playbook for team organization and project execution. While Agile tells you what to value, Scrum tells you how to work.

Both have transformed software engineering by promoting adaptive planning over rigid documentation, encouraging frequent stakeholder feedback, and enabling teams to respond quickly to changing requirements. They've shifted the industry away from waterfall methodologies toward more collaborative, iterative approaches.

Organizations can be Agile without using Scrum by adopting other frameworks like Kanban or Extreme Programming. The choice between pure Agile thinking and Scrum implementation often depends on team size, project complexity, and organizational culture.
