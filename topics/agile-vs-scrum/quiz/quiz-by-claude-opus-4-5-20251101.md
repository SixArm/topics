  <p>Agile is a broad philosophy and set of principles, while Scrum is a specific framework that implements those principles</p>
  <p>Agile is an umbrella term representing guiding values and principles from the Agile Manifesto, emphasizing iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility. Scrum is a tactical framework that implements Agile principles through defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team), ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Review, Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment). While Agile tells you what to value, Scrum tells you how to work.</p>
