  <p>Incubators support early-stage ideation and business model refinement, while accelerators focus on rapid growth and scaling within a defined timeframe</p>
  <p>Incubators typically accept startups at the ideation stage and help them refine business models, validate ideas, and prepare for market entry. Accelerators, on the other hand, offer structured programs focused on rapid scaling and achieving milestones within a defined timeframe, often 3-6 months, with mentorship, funding, and investor network access.</p>
