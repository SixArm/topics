# Agile at GitHub

GitHub exemplifies agile software engineering through its distributed development model and continuous delivery practices. The platform itself is built using agile methodologies, with small, cross-functional teams working in short iterations to deliver features incrementally. GitHub's development teams typically work in two-week sprints, focusing on user stories that directly address customer needs and feedback.

One of GitHub's most notable agile implementations is their use of feature flags and gradual rollouts. When introducing new features like GitHub Actions or Codespaces, they deploy to small user segments first, gather feedback, and iterate rapidly based on real usage data. This approach allows them to validate assumptions quickly and make adjustments before full-scale deployment.

GitHub's internal development culture emphasizes continuous integration and deployment, with developers pushing code multiple times daily. Their "ship to learn" philosophy encourages experimentation and quick pivots based on user behavior. Teams maintain close collaboration through daily standups, retrospectives, and cross-team coordination meetings, even while working remotely across different time zones.

The company also practices "dogfooding" by using their own platform for development, which provides immediate feedback on new features and improvements. This creates a tight feedback loop between development and real-world usage. GitHub's approach to technical debt management is particularly agile â€“ they allocate specific time in each sprint for refactoring and infrastructure improvements, ensuring long-term maintainability doesn't suffer for short-term feature delivery.

Their release process demonstrates agile principles through automated testing, staged deployments, and the ability to quickly roll back changes if issues arise. This technical infrastructure supports rapid iteration while maintaining platform stability for millions of users worldwide.
