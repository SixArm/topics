# Agile at GitHub

Question: What practice does GitHub use to validate new features like GitHub Actions or Codespaces before full-scale deployment?

- [ ] Waterfall phase gates with executive approval
- [ ] Feature flags and gradual rollouts to small user segments
- [ ] Annual release cycles with extensive beta testing
- [ ] Complete feature development in isolation before any user exposure

  <p>Feature flags and gradual rollouts to small user segments</p>
  <p>GitHub deploys new features to small user segments first using feature flags, gathers feedback, and iterates rapidly based on real usage data. This approach allows them to validate assumptions quickly and make adjustments before full-scale deployment, embodying agile principles of incremental delivery and continuous feedback.</p>
