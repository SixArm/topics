  <p>To enable communication and data exchange between different software systems</p>
  <p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are a fundamental component of back-end development that define protocols and methods for different applications to interact and exchange data. Back-end developers design and build APIs using technologies such as RESTful APIs, SOAP APIs, or GraphQL to allow seamless communication between the server-side application and front-end clients, mobile apps, or other external services.</p>
