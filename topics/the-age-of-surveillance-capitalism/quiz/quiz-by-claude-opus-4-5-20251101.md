  <p>Threats to individual autonomy, privacy, and democratic processes</p>
  <p>Zuboff argues that surveillance capitalism—the economic system based on extracting and monetizing personal data—fundamentally threatens individual autonomy, privacy, and democratic processes. This occurs through constant monitoring, behavioral manipulation for profit, concentration of power in a few tech giants, and the potential for surveillance to extend into all aspects of life.</p>
