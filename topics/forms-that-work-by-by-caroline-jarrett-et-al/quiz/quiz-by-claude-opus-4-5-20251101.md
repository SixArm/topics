  <p>Understanding user goals, expectations, and behaviors to align design with their needs</p>
  <p>The book emphasizes User-Centered Design as its core principle. This means form designers must first understand who their users are, what they're trying to accomplish, and how they behave when completing forms. All other design decisions—structure, labels, error handling, accessibility, and mobile optimization—flow from this foundational understanding of user needs and preferences.</p>
