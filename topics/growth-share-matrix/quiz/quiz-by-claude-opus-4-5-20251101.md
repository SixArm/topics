  <p>Questions (Question Marks)</p>
  <p>Questions (also called Question Marks) occupy the quadrant with high market growth rate and low relative market share. These products present a strategic dilemma for technology leaders: they operate in growing markets with potential, but haven't yet achieved market dominance. The key decision is whether to invest resources to capture market share and potentially turn them into Stars, or divest if the market potential is uncertain. This is particularly relevant for technology professionals who must frequently evaluate emerging products and decide where to allocate limited development and marketing resources.</p>
