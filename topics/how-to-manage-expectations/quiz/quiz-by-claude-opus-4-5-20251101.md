  <p>Communicate clearly, document agreements in writing, and provide regular updates</p>
  <p>Effective expectation management requires clear communication of goals, deliverables, timelines, and constraints. Putting expectations in writing through project charters or formal contracts ensures alignment. Regular updates keep stakeholders informed and ensure expectations remain current. This approach prevents misunderstandings, maintains trust, and enables successful outcomes.</p>
