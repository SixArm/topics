  <p>Lack of market demand for the product or service</p>
  <p>While all these factors contribute to startup failures, lack of market demand is consistently cited as the number one reason startups fail. Building a product that customers don't actually want or aren't willing to pay for means the business cannot generate sustainable revenue, regardless of how well-funded or well-managed it may be. This is why customer discovery and market validation are emphasized as critical early-stage activities.</p>
