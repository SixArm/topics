# False positive in test automation

Question: What is the primary consequence of frequent false positives in a test automation suite?

- [ ] Tests execute faster due to early termination
- [ ] Alert fatigue, causing teams to ignore or dismiss legitimate test failures
- [ ] Improved code coverage metrics
- [ ] Reduced need for test maintenance

  <p>Alert fatigue, causing teams to ignore or dismiss legitimate test failures</p>
  <p>When false positives occur frequently, development teams begin to distrust automated results and may dismiss or ignore test failures. This "alert fatigue" is dangerous because actual bugs can be overlooked when mixed with false alarms, ultimately defeating the purpose of test automation entirely.</p>
