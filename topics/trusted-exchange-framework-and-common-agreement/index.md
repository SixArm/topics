# Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA)

Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) is a United States
government initiative designed to create a secure, nationwide, interoperable
health information exchange. It connects different health information
networks—Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs)—to ensure electronic
health information (EHI) flows seamlessly between providers, patients, and
public health agencies. While voluntary, TEFCA aims to standardize, and, for
data sharing across the healthcare industry.

Purpose: To simplify connectivity, improve patient care, reduce, and enhance
public health reporting.

Structure: It sets a universal,, and technical floor for data exchange, allowing
participants to query and retrieve data across different networks.

Components: It consists of the Trusted Exchange Framework (principles for data
sharing) and the Common Agreement (binding legal/technical requirements for
QHINs).

Implementation: The initiative began operating in late 2023, with the first
approved QHINs, and is managed by The Sequoia Project.

Benefits: Enables clinicians to access patient information instantly and allows
individuals to have easier access to their own health records.
