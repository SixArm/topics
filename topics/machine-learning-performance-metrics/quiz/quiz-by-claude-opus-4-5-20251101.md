# Machine learning performance metrics

Question: Which performance metric combines both precision and recall into a single score by calculating their harmonic mean?

- [ ] Accuracy
- [ ] F1-Score
- [ ] Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- [ ] Area Under the Curve (AUC)

  <p>F1-Score</p>
  <p>The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure that accounts for both false positives and false negatives. It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets where accuracy alone can be misleading. The formula is F1 = 2 × (precision × recall) / (precision + recall).</p>
