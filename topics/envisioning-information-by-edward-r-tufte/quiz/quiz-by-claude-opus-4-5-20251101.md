  <p>Maximizing the proportion of ink that directly represents data while minimizing non-essential decoration</p>
  <p>Tufte's Data-Ink Ratio principle emphasizes that effective visualizations should maximize the proportion of ink or graphical elements that directly represent the data, while minimizing non-essential decoration or "chartjunk." This approach ensures that viewers focus on the actual information rather than being distracted by superfluous visual elements, leading to clearer and more honest data communication.</p>
