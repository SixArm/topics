  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>Employees are intrinsically motivated and can be self-directed and creative</p>
  <p>Theory Y assumes employees have a natural desire to achieve, derive satisfaction from work, and seek opportunities for growth. This contrasts with Theory X, which assumes employees are inherently lazy and need close control. Theory Y supports participative leadership that empowers employees and involves them in decision-making, which aligns well with modern agile and collaborative technology team practices.</p>
