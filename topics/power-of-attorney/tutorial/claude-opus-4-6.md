# Power Of Attorney (POA)

## Introduction

A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document that allows an individual, referred to as the "principal," to grant someone else, known as the "agent" or "attorney-in-fact," the legal authority to act on their behalf. The agent can perform specific tasks or make decisions on behalf of the principal, as outlined in the POA document. The agent is legally bound to act in the best interests of the principal and must follow any specific instructions outlined in the POA. For technology professionals, understanding POAs is essential for business formation, intellectual property management, venture capital transactions, corporate governance, and personal estate planning.

## How a Power of Attorney Works

A POA establishes a fiduciary relationship between the principal and the agent. The principal defines the scope of authority in the document, which can range from a single transaction to broad control over financial, legal, and healthcare matters. The agent must act within the boundaries set by the document and is legally obligated to act in good faith, avoid conflicts of interest, and keep accurate records of all actions taken on the principal's behalf.

A POA can be revoked by the principal at any time, as long as the principal is mentally competent. It automatically terminates upon the death of the principal. Some POAs include an expiration date or are tied to the completion of a specific task.

## Types of Power of Attorney

There are several types of POAs, each designed for different situations and levels of authority.

| Type | Scope | Duration | Common Use Cases |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| General POA | Broad authority across financial, legal, and business matters | Ends if principal becomes incapacitated (unless durable) | Business operations, financial management |
| Limited (Specific) POA | Restricted to a particular task or set of tasks | Ends when the task is completed or a specified date passes | Real estate closings, signing a specific contract |
| Durable POA | Can be general or limited in scope | Remains in effect if the principal becomes incapacitated | Long-term estate planning, disability planning |
| Springing POA | Can be general or limited in scope | Activates only upon a triggering event, such as incapacitation | Contingency planning |
| Healthcare POA | Medical and healthcare decisions only | Typically durable; ends at death | Medical treatment decisions, end-of-life care |
| Financial POA | Financial and property matters only | Can be durable or non-durable | Banking, investments, tax filings |

## Durable vs. Non-Durable

A critical distinction in POA documents is durability:

- **Durable POA**: Remains in effect even if the principal becomes incapacitated or unable to make decisions for themselves. This is the most common form for long-term planning because it ensures continuity of management during a crisis. The document must explicitly state that it is durable.
- **Non-Durable POA**: Only valid as long as the principal is mentally competent and able to make decisions. It automatically terminates if the principal becomes incapacitated. This type is typically used for specific, short-term transactions.

For technology professionals who may hold significant equity, intellectual property, or business interests, a durable POA is generally recommended as part of a comprehensive estate and business continuity plan.

## Relevance for Technology Professionals

POAs are commonly used in a variety of situations that technology professionals encounter throughout their careers:

- **Business Formation and Operations**: Founders who travel frequently or live abroad may grant a POA to a co-founder, attorney, or trusted advisor to sign contracts, open bank accounts, or file regulatory documents on their behalf.
- **Intellectual Property Transactions**: A limited POA can authorize an agent to file patent applications, negotiate licensing agreements, or execute IP assignment documents.
- **Venture Capital and Fundraising**: During funding rounds, a POA may be used to authorize a representative to sign closing documents, especially when multiple parties are spread across jurisdictions.
- **Mergers and Acquisitions**: In M&A transactions, a POA can empower an agent to execute deal documents, transfer shares, or manage escrow accounts on behalf of a shareholder who cannot be present.
- **International Operations**: When establishing subsidiaries or conducting business in foreign jurisdictions, a POA is often required to appoint a local representative to act on behalf of the company or individual.
- **Personal Estate Planning**: Technology professionals with stock options, RSUs, cryptocurrency holdings, and other complex assets benefit from having a durable financial POA and healthcare POA in place.

## Choosing an Agent

Selecting the right agent is one of the most important decisions when creating a POA. Consider the following factors:

- **Trustworthiness**: The agent will have significant legal authority. Choose someone with demonstrated integrity and reliability.
- **Competence**: The agent should have the knowledge and ability to handle the specific tasks delegated. For financial POAs involving complex assets like equity compensation or cryptocurrency, financial literacy is important.
- **Availability**: The agent must be willing and available to act when needed, particularly for durable or healthcare POAs.
- **Alignment of Interests**: The agent should not have conflicts of interest that could compromise their duty to act in the principal's best interests.
- **Successor Agents**: It is advisable to name one or more successor agents in case the primary agent is unable or unwilling to serve.

## Legal and Financial Implications

Granting someone a POA can have significant legal and financial implications. Key considerations include:

- **Scope of Authority**: A broadly drafted POA can give the agent the power to sell property, access bank accounts, enter into contracts, and make binding legal decisions. Be precise about what authority is granted.
- **Liability**: The principal can be held liable for actions the agent takes within the scope of the POA. If the agent acts improperly but within the granted authority, third parties may still hold the principal responsible.
- **Abuse and Fraud**: POA abuse is a recognized legal concern. Safeguards include requiring the agent to keep detailed records, limiting the scope of authority, and naming a monitor or co-agent.
- **State and Jurisdictional Requirements**: POA laws vary by state and country. Some jurisdictions require notarization, witnesses, or specific statutory language. A POA valid in one jurisdiction may not be recognized in another.
- **Revocation**: The principal can revoke a POA at any time while mentally competent by providing written notice to the agent and any third parties who have relied on the document.

Related topics to explore include legal agreements such as confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements, and consulting agreements. Technology professionals should also understand fiduciary duty, corporate governance structures, board of advisors roles, and the responsibilities of a chief legal officer. For business contexts, explore due diligence, capitalization tables, equity financing, and simple agreement for future equity (SAFE). For personal planning, consider healthcare directives, estate planning, and trusts.

## Summary

A power of attorney is a foundational legal instrument that enables a principal to delegate decision-making authority to a trusted agent. For technology professionals, POAs serve critical functions across business operations, IP management, fundraising, international expansion, and personal estate planning. The choice between general and specific, durable and non-durable, and financial and healthcare POAs depends on the principal's specific needs and circumstances. Careful selection of an agent, precise drafting of the document's scope, and awareness of jurisdictional requirements are essential to ensuring that a POA serves its intended purpose without exposing the principal to unnecessary risk.
