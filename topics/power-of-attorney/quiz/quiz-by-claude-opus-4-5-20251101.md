  <p>A durable POA remains valid even if the principal becomes incapacitated, while a non-durable POA becomes invalid</p>
  <p>A durable power of attorney remains in effect even if the principal becomes incapacitated or unable to make decisions for themselves. A non-durable POA is only valid as long as the principal is mentally competent and able to make decisions. This distinction is critical for technology professionals involved in estate planning, business continuity, or healthcare applications where decision-making authority must persist through incapacitation scenarios.</p>
