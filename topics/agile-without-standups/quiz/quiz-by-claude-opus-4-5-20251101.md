  <p>It allows teams to maintain collaboration and feedback while eliminating meeting fatigue and preserving development time</p>
  <p>The core agile principles of responding to change, delivering working software frequently, and fostering collaboration don't inherently require daily meetings. Teams can maintain agility through asynchronous tools, shared dashboards, and organic conversations while focusing on outcomes rather than process ceremonies—creating more time for actual development work.</p>
