  <p>To identify a unique, relevant market position that differentiates the brand from competitors</p>
  <p>Brand positioning is fundamentally about defining and communicating a brand's unique value proposition and competitive advantage. The goal is to identify a position in the market that is both different from competitors and meaningful to the target audience. This requires understanding customer needs, analyzing competitors, and articulating a clear value proposition—not simply copying competitors or focusing solely on visual elements.</p>
