# Data-in-motion

Question: Why is encryption essential for data-in-motion?

- [ ] It compresses data to speed up transmission between network endpoints
- [ ] It transforms data into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted with the appropriate key, protecting it from interception
- [ ] It creates backup copies of data during transmission to prevent data loss
- [ ] It organizes data into structured formats for easier processing by applications

  <p>It transforms data into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted with the appropriate key, protecting it from interception</p>
  <p>Data-in-motion is vulnerable to interception, tampering, or theft while being transmitted between network endpoints. Encryption methods such as AES, RSA, or SHA provide security by transforming data into an unreadable format that requires the appropriate decryption key to access, ensuring sensitive information like personal data, financial records, and confidential business data remains protected during transmission.</p>
