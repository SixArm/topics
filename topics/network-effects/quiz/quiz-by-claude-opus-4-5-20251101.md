  <p>Direct effects increase value as more users join the same network, while indirect effects increase value as more complementary products or services are developed</p>
  <p>Direct network effects occur when the value of a product or service increases as more users join the same platform (e.g., social media networks like Facebook or LinkedIn). Indirect network effects occur when value increases due to the growth of complementary products or services—for example, a gaming console becomes more valuable as more game developers create titles for that platform. Understanding this distinction is critical for technology professionals when evaluating platform strategies, competitive moats, and market dynamics.</p>
