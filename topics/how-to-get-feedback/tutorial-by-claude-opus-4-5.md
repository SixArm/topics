# How to Get Feedback: Tutorial

## Overview

Getting feedback is essential for personal and professional growth. In agile environments, where continuous improvement is a core principle, actively seeking and effectively using feedback is not optional -- it is a foundational practice. This tutorial explains how agile change technology professionals can solicit meaningful feedback, process it constructively, and apply it to continuously improve their performance, relationships, and impact.

## Key Concepts

### Be Open and Approachable

The quality of feedback you receive depends largely on how safe and comfortable others feel sharing it with you. Being approachable means demonstrating openness, humility, and a genuine interest in others' perspectives. If people perceive that you will become defensive or dismissive, they will withhold the honest feedback you need most.

Signal your openness by:

- Explicitly inviting feedback.
- Responding graciously when you receive it.
- Thanking people for their candor.
- Acting on feedback visibly, which reinforces that giving you feedback is worthwhile.

### Ask Different Sources

No single person has a complete view of your performance. Seek feedback from a variety of sources: supervisors, colleagues, direct reports, mentors, peers in other departments, customers, and clients. Each perspective reveals different aspects of your work and behavior.

In agile contexts, this might mean asking for feedback from:

- Your Scrum Master on your participation in ceremonies.
- Your product owner on the quality and timeliness of your deliverables.
- Your teammates on your collaboration and communication.
- Your stakeholders on your responsiveness and professionalism.

### Be Specific

Vague requests like "Do you have any feedback for me?" often produce vague responses. Instead, ask about specific areas:

- "How could I have communicated the project risks more effectively in yesterday's meeting?"
- "What is one thing I could do to be a better collaborator?"
- "Was the documentation I provided clear and useful?"

Specific questions help others focus their observations and provide more actionable insights.

### Ask Open-Ended Questions

Instead of asking yes/no questions ("Was my presentation okay?"), use open-ended questions that invite detailed responses:

- "What stood out to you about the presentation, and what could I improve?"
- "How did the sprint review go from your perspective?"
- "What would you like to see me do differently?"

### Listen Actively

When receiving feedback, listen without interrupting or becoming defensive. Give the person your full attention. Resist the urge to explain or justify your actions. Instead, focus on understanding their perspective. Ask clarifying questions if needed, but let them finish their thoughts first.

### Respond Graciously

Express genuine appreciation for the feedback, regardless of whether it is positive or constructive. Thank the person for taking the time to share their observations. Even if you disagree with the feedback, acknowledge it respectfully. Defensive reactions discourage future feedback.

### Reflect and Apply

Take time to reflect on the feedback you receive. Consider how it aligns with your own self-assessment and goals. Identify patterns -- if multiple people mention the same area, it is likely a genuine development opportunity. Create an action plan to address the feedback, and track your progress over time.

### Follow Up

If there are aspects of the feedback you do not fully understand, reach out to the person for clarification. After you have had time to work on the feedback, circle back to let them know what changes you have made and ask if they have noticed improvement. This reinforces the feedback loop and demonstrates your commitment to growth.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Schedule regular feedback conversations.** Do not wait for annual reviews. Set up monthly or quarterly check-ins with key colleagues, your manager, and your stakeholders specifically to request feedback.

2. **Use retrospectives as a feedback source.** Agile retrospectives are a natural venue for team-level feedback. Pay attention to themes and patterns that apply to your individual performance.

3. **Create a feedback journal.** Document the feedback you receive, your reflections on it, and the actions you plan to take. Review it periodically to track your growth.

4. **Ask for feedback immediately after key events.** After a demo, a meeting you led, a document you authored, or a challenging interaction, ask for feedback while the experience is fresh.

5. **Diversify your feedback sources.** Make a list of five to eight people who have different perspectives on your work. Rotate through them over time to build a comprehensive picture.

6. **Practice receiving feedback gracefully.** The next time someone offers feedback, focus exclusively on listening and thanking. Do not explain or defend. Simply say, "Thank you, that is helpful."

7. **Close the loop.** After implementing changes based on feedback, go back to the person who gave it and share what you have done. Ask if they have noticed a difference.

8. **Model feedback-seeking behavior.** When others see you actively seeking and valuing feedback, they become more comfortable doing the same. This strengthens the entire team's culture of continuous improvement.

## Key Takeaway

The ability to seek, receive, and act on feedback is one of the most powerful drivers of professional growth. Agile change technology professionals who actively solicit feedback from diverse sources, listen without defensiveness, reflect thoughtfully, and take visible action create a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement. The feedback you receive is not a judgment -- it is a gift of perspective that helps you see what you cannot see on your own. Make feedback-seeking a regular habit, and you will grow faster and more effectively than those who wait for feedback to come to them.
