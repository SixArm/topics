  <p>Unicode can represent over 100,000 characters including multiple scripts and languages</p>
  <p>While ASCII uses 7-bit code to represent only 128 characters (primarily English letters, numbers, and basic symbols), Unicode uses 16-bit or 32-bit code to represent more than 100,000 characters. This allows Unicode to support various scripts, languages, and symbols from around the world, making it essential for internationalization and global software development.</p>
