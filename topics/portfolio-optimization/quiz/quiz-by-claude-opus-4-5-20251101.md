  <p>Maximizing expected return or minimizing risk by selecting the optimal combination of assets</p>
  <p>Portfolio optimization is fundamentally about achieving the best possible balance between risk and return. This involves carefully analyzing and adjusting the allocation of investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities) using quantitative models, optimization algorithms, and continuous rebalancing to meet defined objectives such as desired return, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.</p>
