  <p>It includes a specific action, measurable target, and clear method of tracking progress</p>
  <p>Effective SMART OKRs for agile change combine specific actions (e.g., "Interview 25 team members"), measurable targets (e.g., "Improve score by 45%"), timeboxes (e.g., "by Q2 end"), and explicit tracking methods (e.g., "Score by quarterly team health surveys"). This structure ensures objectives are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound while providing accountability through defined quantification approaches.</p>
