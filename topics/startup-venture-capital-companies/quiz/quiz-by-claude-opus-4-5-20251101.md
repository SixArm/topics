  <p>Achieving a successful exit through an IPO or acquisition</p>
  <p>Venture capital firms invest in startups with the expectation of achieving a successful exit, either through an initial public offering (IPO) or through acquisition by a larger company. This exit provides a liquidity event for the investors and allows them to realize their returns on investment. Unlike traditional investors seeking dividends, VCs accept high risk in exchange for potentially significant returns when the company goes public or is acquired.</p>
