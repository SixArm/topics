# Look for the people who want to change the world

## Introduction

"Look for the people who want to change the world" is a hiring and culture philosophy most closely associated with Salesforce, one of the world's largest customer relationship management (CRM) companies. The phrase captures a leadership principle that extends well beyond recruiting: it articulates the belief that organizations achieve their greatest results when they attract individuals driven by purpose, not just profit. For technology professionals, this idea has broad implications for how teams are built, how products are designed, and how companies position themselves in competitive markets. Understanding this philosophy helps leaders and individual contributors alike make better decisions about where to work, whom to hire, and how to sustain motivation over the long arc of a career.

## Origins and Context

The phrase is rooted in Salesforce's founding culture, shaped by CEO Marc Benioff's conviction that business should serve as a platform for social change. Benioff drew on his early career experiences at Oracle and his exposure to philanthropic leaders to develop a corporate philosophy that deliberately fused commercial ambition with social mission. The idea gained public visibility through Salesforce's rapid growth in the 2000s and 2010s, as the company consistently appeared on "best places to work" lists while simultaneously scaling a significant corporate philanthropy program.

The broader context matters as well. The phrase emerged during a period when the technology industry was grappling with questions about its role in society. Debates about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and environmental impact made it increasingly clear that technical talent alone was insufficient. Companies needed people who could think critically about the consequences of technology and who were motivated to steer it toward positive outcomes.

## Core Principles

The philosophy rests on several interconnected ideas that inform how purpose-driven organizations operate.

- **Values alignment over skills matching.** Traditional hiring focuses on technical competence and domain expertise. This philosophy adds a critical filter: does the candidate care about the mission? Skills can be taught, but intrinsic motivation is difficult to manufacture.
- **Culture as a competitive advantage.** When everyone in an organization shares a commitment to impact, collaboration becomes easier, attrition drops, and the organization can move faster on ambitious goals.
- **Business as a platform for change.** Rather than treating social responsibility as a side project, this approach embeds it into core business operations, product decisions, and strategic planning.
- **Long-term thinking.** People who want to change the world tend to think in terms of durable impact rather than quarterly results. This orientation supports sustainable growth and more resilient decision-making.

## The Salesforce 1-1-1 Model

One of the most concrete expressions of this philosophy is the Salesforce 1-1-1 model, which commits the company to donating one percent of its equity, one percent of its employees' time, and one percent of its products to charitable causes. This model has been widely imitated across the technology industry and demonstrates how abstract values can be operationalized at scale.

| Component | Commitment | Practical Impact |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1% Equity | Allocate one percent of company equity to a corporate foundation | Funds grants, disaster relief, and community programs |
| 1% Time | Employees receive paid volunteer hours each year | Builds engagement, develops leadership skills, strengthens community ties |
| 1% Product | Donate or discount products for nonprofits and educational institutions | Extends technology access to organizations that could not otherwise afford it |

The 1-1-1 model is significant because it is baked into the company from inception, not bolted on after profitability is achieved. This structural commitment signals to prospective employees that the mission is genuine, which in turn attracts the kind of people the philosophy describes.

## Why This Matters for Technology Professionals

Technology professionals occupy a unique position in the modern economy. The products they build, the systems they architect, and the data they manage touch billions of lives. This amplifying effect means that the motivations of the people building technology have outsized consequences.

- **Product design decisions.** Engineers and designers who care about changing the world are more likely to consider accessibility, inclusivity, and unintended consequences during the design process.
- **Ethical judgment.** Purpose-driven professionals are better equipped to raise concerns when a project conflicts with their values, creating a healthy check on organizational blind spots.
- **Resilience and retention.** Technology careers involve long hours, ambiguous problems, and frequent setbacks. A sense of purpose provides durable motivation that compensation alone cannot sustain.
- **Talent attraction.** Organizations known for their mission-driven culture have a measurable advantage in recruiting, particularly among younger professionals who rank purpose highly in their career decisions.

## Applying the Philosophy in Practice

Adopting this mindset does not require working at Salesforce or any particular company. Technology professionals can apply it in multiple contexts.

| Context | Application |
|---------|------------|
| Hiring and interviewing | Ask candidates about the impact they want to have, not just the technologies they know |
| Team building | Explicitly discuss team values and connect daily work to broader outcomes |
| Career decisions | Evaluate prospective employers on mission alignment, not just compensation and title |
| Product strategy | Frame roadmap discussions around user impact and societal benefit alongside business metrics |
| Open source and community | Contribute to projects that advance public goods such as education, health, or environmental sustainability |

The key shift is from treating purpose as a personal preference to treating it as a professional asset. Teams that share a sense of mission consistently outperform teams that are held together only by transactional incentives.

## Criticisms and Limitations

No philosophy is without its critics. Several common objections deserve honest consideration.

- **Performative purpose.** Some organizations adopt mission-driven language without making structural commitments, leading to cynicism among employees and the public. The gap between stated values and actual behavior is a recurring problem.
- **Exclusionary effects.** Emphasizing cultural fit around mission can inadvertently narrow the range of perspectives in an organization if "wanting to change the world" is defined too narrowly or measured too subjectively.
- **Tension with commercial goals.** Mission-driven rhetoric can create friction when business realities demand difficult trade-offs, such as layoffs, market exits, or partnerships with controversial entities.
- **Privilege assumptions.** The ability to prioritize purpose over pay is not equally available to all professionals. Economic constraints shape career decisions, and a philosophy that centers purpose must also address equity and access.

Acknowledging these limitations does not invalidate the core idea. It sharpens it. The most effective mission-driven organizations are those that confront these tensions directly rather than ignoring them.

Professionals interested in this topic should explore related concepts including corporate social responsibility, the triple bottom line framework, values-driven leadership, the B Corporation certification movement, stakeholder capitalism, organizational culture design, the Salesforce Ohana culture model, purpose-driven product management, and ethical technology design. Understanding employee engagement theory and intrinsic motivation research, particularly the work of Daniel Pink on autonomy, mastery, and purpose, provides a strong psychological foundation for why this philosophy works in practice.

## Summary

"Look for the people who want to change the world" is more than a recruiting slogan. It is a strategic principle asserting that the most impactful organizations are built by people who are motivated by purpose as much as by profit. For technology professionals, this philosophy provides a lens for evaluating career choices, building teams, and designing products that create lasting value. The Salesforce 1-1-1 model demonstrates that this commitment can be operationalized at scale, and the broader adoption of similar frameworks across the industry confirms its resonance. While legitimate criticisms exist around performative purpose and equity of access, the core insight remains sound: when you assemble people who genuinely want to make a difference, the quality of the work and the impact of the outcomes improve dramatically.
