# Look for the People Who Want to Change the World: Tutorial

## Overview

"Look for the people who want to change the world" is a phrase closely associated with Salesforce, one of the world's leading customer relationship management (CRM) software companies. The phrase represents Salesforce's commitment to hiring and working with individuals who are passionate about making a positive difference. For agile change technology professionals, this concept goes beyond recruitment -- it speaks to the power of values alignment, purpose-driven culture, and the belief that business can and should be a force for good. Understanding and applying this principle can transform how teams are built, how organizations operate, and the impact that technology work can have on the world.

## Key Concepts and Explanation

### Values Alignment in the Workplace

At its core, "look for the people who want to change the world" is a statement about values alignment. When organizations seek individuals who are driven by purpose and a desire to make a positive impact, they create a workforce that is intrinsically motivated. Intrinsic motivation -- the drive that comes from within rather than from external rewards -- is one of the strongest predictors of sustained engagement, creativity, and performance. People who believe in the mission of their organization bring energy and commitment that no amount of compensation can replicate.

### Purpose-Driven Culture

Salesforce built its culture around the idea that business can be a force for good. This is not just a marketing message; it is embedded in how the company hires, develops, and retains people. A purpose-driven culture attracts people who want their work to matter beyond the bottom line. For agile change professionals, this means that culture is not just about process and collaboration -- it is also about meaning and impact.

### The 1-1-1 Model

Salesforce operationalized its commitment to changing the world through the 1-1-1 model: donating 1% of the company's equity, 1% of its employees' time, and 1% of its products to charitable causes. This model demonstrates that purpose can be structured and measurable, not just aspirational. By giving back to the community and supporting important causes, Salesforce reinforces its cultural identity and creates opportunities for employees to connect their work to broader social impact.

### Building World-Changing Teams

The principle extends beyond hiring to how teams are composed, led, and empowered. World-changing people are not just those with exceptional technical skills; they are people with passion, empathy, curiosity, and a drive to solve meaningful problems. Agile teams that include people with these qualities tend to produce more innovative solutions and maintain higher levels of engagement through the inevitable challenges of complex projects.

## Practical Steps for Implementation

1. **Hire for values alignment alongside technical skills.** During the hiring process, assess candidates' passion, purpose, and alignment with the organization's mission. Ask questions about what motivates them, what kind of impact they want to have, and how they define meaningful work. Technical skills can be developed; intrinsic motivation is much harder to instill.

2. **Articulate a compelling mission.** Every organization and team should have a clear, inspiring answer to the question "why do we exist?" This mission should go beyond making money to describe the positive change the organization seeks to create. Communicate this mission consistently and connect it to daily work.

3. **Create opportunities for impact beyond the product.** Establish programs -- like Salesforce's 1-1-1 model -- that enable team members to contribute to social, environmental, or community causes. Volunteer days, pro bono projects, and charitable giving programs give people tangible ways to make a difference.

4. **Empower people to pursue meaningful work.** Give team members autonomy to identify and pursue projects that align with the organization's mission and their own sense of purpose. When people feel ownership over meaningful work, they bring their best effort and creativity.

5. **Build diverse, purpose-driven teams.** Seek out people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives who share a common commitment to positive impact. Diversity combined with shared purpose produces teams that are both innovative and cohesive.

6. **Recognize and celebrate impact.** Regularly acknowledge the positive impact that team members and the organization are having -- both through the product and through community engagement. Share stories of how the team's work has made a difference in people's lives.

7. **Lead with purpose.** Leaders should model purpose-driven behavior by being transparent about their own motivations, investing in causes they believe in, and making decisions that reflect the organization's values even when there is a short-term cost.

8. **Connect agile practices to purpose.** Frame agile ceremonies and practices in terms of the impact they enable. Sprint reviews become opportunities to celebrate the value delivered to users. Retrospectives become opportunities to ensure the team is aligned with its mission. Backlog prioritization becomes an exercise in maximizing positive impact.

## Key Takeaway

"Look for the people who want to change the world" teaches agile change professionals that the most powerful teams are built not just on skills and processes but on shared purpose and values. When organizations prioritize values alignment in hiring, create purpose-driven cultures, and provide structured ways for people to make a positive impact, they unlock a level of motivation and commitment that transcends what traditional management approaches can achieve. The agile principle of valuing individuals and interactions over processes and tools finds its deepest expression when those individuals are united by a genuine desire to make the world better.
