## Look for the People Who Want to Change the World

The phrase "look for the people who want to change the world" represents a fundamental hiring and organizational philosophy that prioritizes purpose-driven individuals over purely skills-driven recruitment. Popularized by Salesforce, this approach has become a cornerstone of modern technology culture and reflects a broader shift in how companies think about talent acquisition and corporate mission.

## The Core Philosophy

This principle asserts that the most valuable team members are those who share a deep commitment to meaningful impact. Rather than hiring solely for technical competence or experience, organizations following this philosophy actively seek candidates whose personal values align with the company's mission.

The underlying belief is straightforward: people who genuinely want to change the world bring intrinsic motivation, resilience, and creative energy that cannot be taught or incentivized through compensation alone. These individuals view their work as more than a job—they see it as a vehicle for achieving something larger than themselves.

## Why Values Alignment Matters in Technology

Technology professionals wield significant influence over how products and systems shape society. The decisions made during software architecture, data handling, algorithm design, and user experience have far-reaching consequences. When team members are personally invested in positive outcomes, they naturally consider ethical implications and long-term impact.

| Hiring Approach | Primary Focus | Typical Outcome |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Skills-only | Technical competence | Functional products, potential ethical blind spots |
| Values-aligned | Purpose and capability | Mission-driven innovation, stronger retention |
| Mixed approach | Balance of both | Varies based on cultural reinforcement |

Organizations that prioritize values alignment often report higher employee engagement, lower turnover, and stronger collaboration. When everyone shares a common vision of impact, disagreements become productive debates about the best path forward rather than conflicts over fundamental priorities.

## The Salesforce 1-1-1 Model

Salesforce operationalized this philosophy through its 1-1-1 philanthropic model, which dedicates:

- **1% of equity** to charitable foundations
- **1% of employee time** to volunteer activities
- **1% of products** donated or discounted for nonprofits

This model demonstrates that "wanting to change the world" is not merely aspirational rhetoric but a structural commitment embedded in business operations. For technology professionals, this creates tangible opportunities to apply their skills toward social good while maintaining their primary roles.

## Identifying World-Changers in Hiring

Recognizing candidates who genuinely want to change the world requires going beyond standard interview questions. Effective approaches include:

- **Examining side projects and volunteer work** — What do candidates do when no one is paying them?
- **Discussing failures and lessons learned** — Purpose-driven individuals often have stories of ambitious attempts that taught them valuable lessons
- **Exploring motivations behind career choices** — Why technology? Why this company? Why now?
- **Assessing reactions to ethical dilemmas** — How do they reason about tradeoffs between business goals and user welfare?

Red flags include candidates who speak exclusively about personal advancement, show no curiosity about the company's mission, or dismiss ethical considerations as impractical.

## Practical Applications for Technology Teams

Implementing this philosophy extends beyond hiring into daily operations:

- **Product decisions** should explicitly consider impact on users and society
- **Technical debt** conversations should include discussion of how delays affect the mission
- **Performance reviews** should evaluate contributions to purpose, not just deliverables
- **Team rituals** should reinforce connection between daily work and larger goals

## Potential Challenges

This approach is not without difficulties:

| Challenge | Description | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Performative alignment | Candidates who say the right things without genuine commitment | Extended interview processes, reference checks on values |
| Mission drift | Gradual erosion of purpose under business pressures | Regular mission reviews, leadership accountability |
| Exclusivity | Inadvertently filtering out diverse perspectives | Recognize that "changing the world" takes many forms |
| Burnout | Purpose-driven people may overwork themselves | Establish boundaries, celebrate sustainable pace |

## Building a World-Changing Culture

Creating an environment where world-changers thrive requires consistent reinforcement:

- **Leadership must model the behavior** — Executives who prioritize short-term metrics over mission undermine the entire philosophy
- **Stories matter** — Regularly share examples of how the team's work created positive impact
- **Transparency builds trust** — Be honest about tensions between business realities and idealistic goals
- **Celebrate the right things** — Recognize contributions to mission, not just revenue or shipping velocity

## The Technology Professional's Perspective

For individual technologists, this philosophy offers a framework for evaluating employers and career decisions. Questions to consider:

- Does this organization's mission align with what I believe matters?
- Will my daily work contribute to outcomes I find meaningful?
- Are the people I'd work with genuinely committed to the stated values?
- Does the company's behavior match its stated philosophy?

Working alongside others who share your commitment to positive change transforms the employment relationship from transactional to collaborative. The work becomes more fulfilling, the challenges feel more worthwhile, and the inevitable setbacks become shared obstacles rather than personal burdens.

## Conclusion

"Look for the people who want to change the world" is more than a recruiting slogan—it represents a coherent philosophy about how organizations can achieve both business success and meaningful impact. For technology professionals, this principle offers guidance for both hiring decisions and personal career choices. The most enduring technology companies are often those that attract and retain people who believe their work matters beyond the balance sheet.
