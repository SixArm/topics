  <p>It articulates an aspirational future state or purpose that inspires and guides the organization</p>
  <p>Vision statements like Google's "To provide access to the world's information in one click," Wikipedia's "Imagine a world in which every single person is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge," and LinkedIn's "Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce" all share a common trait: they describe an ambitious, future-oriented purpose that transcends day-to-day operations. Effective vision statements are aspirational, inspiring, and provide directional guidance rather than focusing on current products, financial metrics, or competitive positioning.</p>
