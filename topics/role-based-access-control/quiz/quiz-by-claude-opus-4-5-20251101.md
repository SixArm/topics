  <p>It simplifies administration by managing permissions at the role level rather than individually</p>
  <p>RBAC's key advantage is that it simplifies the administration of user privileges. Instead of managing user permissions individually, administrators can assign roles to groups of users and manage permissions at the role level. This makes it easier to ensure that users have the appropriate level of access to system resources while reducing administrative overhead.</p>
