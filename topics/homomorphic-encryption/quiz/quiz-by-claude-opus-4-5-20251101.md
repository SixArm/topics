# Homomorphic encryption

Question: What is the primary advantage of homomorphic encryption in cloud computing scenarios?

- [ ] It compresses data to reduce storage costs
- [ ] It allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first
- [ ] It speeds up data transmission between client and server
- [ ] It eliminates the need for encryption keys

  <p>It allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first</p>
  <p>Homomorphic encryption's key capability is enabling mathematical operations on encrypted data while preserving confidentiality. This means cloud providers can process sensitive data without ever accessing the plaintext, making it ideal for secure computation in untrusted environments such as cloud services, medical research, and financial analysis.</p>
