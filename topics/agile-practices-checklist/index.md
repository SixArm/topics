- Decisions are made quickly, sometimes with incomplete knowledge.
- Plans are based on data and experience.
- Dependencies between teams are proactively identified and addressed.
- An educated executive sponsor ensures the change agent is empowered to make decisions.
- People are assumed to have acted with good intentions even when something goes wrong.
- Trust is reciprocal within the team and with stakeholders.
- Although formal documentation may exist, it is supplemented by conversations to the extent possible.
- As more is learned, plans are updated rather than remaining based on outdated information.
- A non-punitive attitude leads to the team’s willingness to experiment with new tools, technologies, and ways of working.
- People honor commitments and keep promises.
- Outside groups that partner with the team are aware of how this new way of working may affect their interactions.
- The organization places a higher value on finished work than it does on the number of work items in process.
- The early release of a good product is generally favored over the later release of a perfect product.
- Quality is rarely, if ever, sacrificed to meet a deadline.
- When problems arise between teams, everyone focuses on a solution rather than blame.
- Change agents are in place to help support and guide the transition.
- Agile practices are being implemented beyond the group in which agile began.
- Most people are assigned to only one team.
