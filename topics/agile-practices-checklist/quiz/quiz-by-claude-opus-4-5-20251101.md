  <p>The early release of a good product is generally favored over the later release of a perfect product, while quality is rarely sacrificed to meet a deadline</p>
  <p>Agile practices balance the tension between speed and quality by favoring early delivery of valuable, working software while maintaining quality standards. The checklist explicitly states that "the early release of a good product is generally favored over the later release of a perfect product" AND "quality is rarely, if ever, sacrificed to meet a deadline." This reflects the agile principle of delivering working software frequently while maintaining sustainable development practices.</p>
