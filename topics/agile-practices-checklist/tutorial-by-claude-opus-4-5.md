## Agile Practices Checklist

The agile practices checklist serves as a diagnostic tool for organizations seeking to evaluate and improve their agile implementation. Originally developed by Mountain Goat Software, this checklist identifies the cultural, operational, and organizational factors that distinguish truly agile teams from those merely following agile rituals without embracing the underlying principles.

## Why Use an Agile Practices Checklist

Adopting agile goes far beyond implementing Scrum ceremonies or using Kanban boards. Many organizations experience "agile in name only" where teams hold daily standups but continue waterfall thinking. A checklist provides an objective framework to assess whether your organization has internalized agile values or is simply performing agile theater.

The checklist approach offers several benefits:

- Identifies specific gaps in agile adoption
- Creates a shared understanding of what agile looks like in practice
- Provides measurable criteria for improvement
- Helps prevent backsliding into old habits
- Guides conversations about organizational change

## Core Practice Areas

The agile practices checklist spans five interconnected domains that together create the conditions for agile success.

| Domain | Focus Area | Key Question |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Decision Making | Speed and pragmatism | Are decisions made quickly with available information? |
| Trust and Culture | Psychological safety | Do people assume good intentions when things go wrong? |
| Planning and Adaptation | Responsiveness to change | Are plans updated as new information emerges? |
| Collaboration | Communication patterns | Is documentation supplemented by direct conversation? |
| Organizational Support | Structural alignment | Are change agents empowered to guide the transition? |

## Decision Making Practices

Agile organizations make decisions quickly, accepting that perfect information rarely exists. Waiting for complete knowledge before acting creates bottlenecks and delays that undermine agility.

**Key indicators of healthy decision making:**

- Decisions are made quickly, sometimes with incomplete knowledge
- Plans are based on data and experience rather than assumptions or politics
- Dependencies between teams are proactively identified and addressed
- An educated executive sponsor ensures change agents are empowered to make decisions

The willingness to decide without complete information requires organizational courage. Teams must trust that their judgment, combined with the ability to course-correct later, produces better outcomes than analysis paralysis.

## Trust and Cultural Practices

Trust forms the foundation of every agile practice. Without it, teams cannot take risks, admit mistakes, or engage in the honest conversations necessary for continuous improvement.

**Indicators of a trust-based culture:**

- People are assumed to have acted with good intentions even when something goes wrong
- Trust is reciprocal within the team and with stakeholders
- A non-punitive attitude leads to willingness to experiment with new tools, technologies, and ways of working
- People honor commitments and keep promises
- When problems arise between teams, everyone focuses on solutions rather than blame

The distinction between blame and accountability matters enormously. Agile teams hold each other accountable for outcomes while avoiding the finger-pointing that destroys psychological safety.

## Planning and Adaptation Practices

Agile planning embraces change rather than resisting it. Plans serve as starting points for action, not rigid contracts to be defended.

**Healthy planning behaviors include:**

- As more is learned, plans are updated rather than remaining based on outdated information
- The early release of a good product is generally favored over the later release of a perfect product
- Quality is rarely, if ever, sacrificed to meet a deadline
- The organization places higher value on finished work than on work items in process

| Traditional Planning | Agile Planning |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Plan is fixed; reality must conform | Reality is fixed; plan must adapt |
| Deviation from plan equals failure | Deviation from plan equals learning |
| Completeness before release | Value before completeness |
| Parallel work maximizes efficiency | Limiting WIP maximizes throughput |

The tension between speed and quality deserves attention. True agile teams recognize that cutting quality creates technical debt that ultimately slows delivery. The goal is not faster delivery at any cost but sustainable pace with consistently high quality.

## Collaboration Practices

Effective agile teams prioritize direct human interaction over process and tools, recognizing that conversation conveys nuance that documentation cannot capture.

**Collaboration indicators:**

- Although formal documentation may exist, it is supplemented by conversations to the extent possible
- Outside groups that partner with the team are aware of how the new way of working may affect their interactions
- Most people are assigned to only one team

Single-team assignment deserves emphasis. Context switching between multiple projects destroys productivity. Research consistently shows that multitasking reduces effectiveness by 20-40%, yet many organizations continue assigning people to multiple teams simultaneously.

## Organizational Support Practices

Agile adoption requires organizational support beyond the team level. Without leadership alignment and structural changes, teams face constant friction that undermines their efforts.

**Organizational enablers:**

- Change agents are in place to help support and guide the transition
- An educated executive sponsor ensures change agents are empowered
- Agile practices are being implemented beyond the group in which agile began

The phrase "educated executive sponsor" is significant. Superficial executive support—agreeing that agile sounds good without understanding what it requires—does not suffice. Sponsors must understand enough about agile to remove organizational impediments and protect teams from anti-agile demands.

## Using the Checklist Effectively

The checklist works best as a catalyst for conversation rather than a simple yes/no assessment.

**Recommended approach:**

1. Have team members individually rate each item
2. Compare ratings to identify areas of agreement and disagreement
3. Discuss specific examples that inform ratings
4. Prioritize improvement areas based on impact and feasibility
5. Define concrete actions to address gaps
6. Reassess periodically to track progress

Avoid treating the checklist as a performance evaluation or compliance requirement. The goal is improvement, not judgment. Teams should feel safe acknowledging gaps without fear of punishment.

## Common Anti-Patterns

Even teams using the checklist can fall into traps that undermine its value.

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Remedy |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Checkbox mentality | Focusing on claiming compliance rather than achieving outcomes | Discuss specific examples for each item |
| Leadership exemption | Applying checklist to teams but not to organizational behavior | Include leadership in assessment |
| One-time assessment | Treating assessment as a one-time event | Schedule regular reassessments |
| Blame-driven review | Using gaps as evidence of team failure | Frame gaps as improvement opportunities |
| Isolation from context | Ignoring organizational constraints that prevent adoption | Address systemic impediments |

## Relationship to Agile Maturity

The practices checklist complements agile maturity models but serves a different purpose. Maturity models typically focus on process adoption and capability levels. The checklist emphasizes cultural and behavioral factors that determine whether processes actually work.

An organization can achieve high marks on process maturity assessments while failing the practices checklist. Such organizations have the mechanics of agile but lack the mindset. Conversely, teams with strong cultural foundations sometimes succeed despite imperfect process implementation.

## Scaling Considerations

As organizations scale agile beyond individual teams, the checklist items become more challenging but also more important.

**Scaling challenges:**

- Dependencies multiply as more teams coordinate
- Trust becomes harder to maintain across organizational boundaries
- Communication patterns must evolve to prevent information bottlenecks
- Executive sponsorship must extend to enterprise-level decisions
- Resistance from non-agile groups intensifies

Successful scaling requires extending the checklist principles throughout the organization rather than treating them as team-level concerns. Enterprise agility demands that portfolio management, budgeting, HR practices, and vendor relationships all align with agile principles.

## Conclusion

The agile practices checklist provides a practical tool for assessing and improving agile adoption. Its focus on cultural and behavioral factors addresses the reality that agile transformation fails more often from mindset resistance than from process confusion.

Organizations that consistently meet checklist criteria have internalized agile as a way of working rather than a methodology to follow. They make decisions quickly, trust their people, adapt their plans, communicate directly, and create organizational structures that support rather than impede agility.

Regular use of the checklist keeps teams honest about their agile practice while identifying specific areas for continuous improvement. The goal is not perfection but progress—moving steadily toward an organizational culture where agile practices feel natural rather than imposed.
