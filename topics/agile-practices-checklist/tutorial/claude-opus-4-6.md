# Agile practices checklist

Agile practices are the day-to-day behaviors, norms, and organizational habits that distinguish teams genuinely working in an agile way from those that have merely adopted agile terminology. This checklist, originally inspired by the work of Mountain Goat Software, provides a concrete set of observable indicators that leaders, coaches, and team members can use to assess how deeply agile values have taken root. Rather than focusing on any single framework such as Scrum or Kanban, the checklist addresses the cultural and operational fundamentals that underpin all successful agile implementations.

## Decision-Making and Planning

Effective agile organizations treat decision-making as a continuous, data-informed activity rather than a periodic ceremony. Two checklist items speak directly to this:

- **Decisions are made quickly, sometimes with incomplete knowledge.** Agile teams accept that waiting for perfect information is itself a decision, and usually a costly one. They prefer reversible decisions made promptly over delayed decisions made with marginal additional certainty.
- **Plans are based on data and experience.** Velocity, cycle time, and historical throughput replace wishful thinking. Estimates draw on what the team has actually delivered, not on what stakeholders hope for.
- **As more is learned, plans are updated rather than remaining based on outdated information.** Plans are living artifacts. When new data arrives, whether from a sprint review, a market shift, or a failed experiment, the plan adapts.

| Traditional Planning | Agile Planning |
|---|---|
| Plans locked at project start | Plans revised every iteration |
| Estimates based on top-down targets | Estimates based on empirical data |
| Change treated as scope creep | Change treated as new learning |
| Single large delivery at the end | Incremental delivery throughout |

## Trust and Interpersonal Dynamics

Agile cannot function in a low-trust environment. Several items on the checklist address the social contract that must exist within and around teams:

- **People are assumed to have acted with good intentions even when something goes wrong.** This is the foundation of psychological safety. Without it, retrospectives become blame sessions, and experimentation stops.
- **Trust is reciprocal within the team and with stakeholders.** Trust must flow in every direction: between developers, between the team and its product owner, and between the team and the broader organization.
- **People honor commitments and keep promises.** Trust is earned through reliability. When a team member says they will investigate a technical risk or a stakeholder agrees to provide feedback by Thursday, those commitments matter.
- **When problems arise between teams, everyone focuses on a solution rather than blame.** Cross-team friction is inevitable. The checklist item asks whether the default response is collaborative problem-solving or finger-pointing.

## Communication and Documentation

Agile does not eliminate documentation; it rebalances the relationship between written artifacts and direct human interaction.

- **Although formal documentation may exist, it is supplemented by conversations to the extent possible.** The Agile Manifesto values "working software over comprehensive documentation," but the key word is "over," not "instead of." High-bandwidth conversation fills gaps that documents cannot.
- **Outside groups that partner with the team are aware of how this new way of working may affect their interactions.** Agile teams do not operate in isolation. Legal, compliance, procurement, and other departments need to understand how iterative delivery changes cadence, artifacts, and expectations.

## Experimentation and Quality

A healthy agile culture balances the courage to experiment with a disciplined commitment to quality.

- **A non-punitive attitude leads to the team's willingness to experiment with new tools, technologies, and ways of working.** If failure is punished, teams will default to the safest possible choice every time. Innovation requires the freedom to fail safely.
- **The early release of a good product is generally favored over the later release of a perfect product.** This reflects the principle of delivering value early and often. Real user feedback on a shipped product is worth more than internal speculation about a hypothetical one.
- **Quality is rarely, if ever, sacrificed to meet a deadline.** This item acts as a counterbalance. Speed matters, but not at the expense of sustainable engineering practices, test coverage, or user experience.

| Anti-Pattern | Agile Practice |
|---|---|
| Cutting tests to hit a date | Adjusting scope to protect quality |
| Punishing failed experiments | Running time-boxed experiments safely |
| Shipping only when "perfect" | Releasing incrementally with feedback loops |
| Avoiding new tools out of fear | Evaluating new tools in controlled spikes |

## Organizational Alignment and Scaling

Individual teams can practice agile, but lasting success requires organizational support and deliberate scaling.

- **An educated executive sponsor ensures the change agent is empowered to make decisions.** Executive sponsorship is not ceremonial. The sponsor must understand agile principles well enough to remove organizational impediments and defend the team's way of working.
- **Change agents are in place to help support and guide the transition.** Whether called coaches, Scrum Masters, or transformation leads, these individuals serve as catalysts who help teams and organizations navigate the shift.
- **Agile practices are being implemented beyond the group in which agile began.** Agile that stays confined to a single pilot team often withers. Sustainable adoption spreads across the organization, adapting to each context.
- **Dependencies between teams are proactively identified and addressed.** In multi-team environments, unmanaged dependencies are the most common source of delay. Agile organizations surface these dependencies early through techniques such as dependency boards, cross-team planning, and integration cadences.
- **Most people are assigned to only one team.** Context-switching between multiple teams destroys focus and accountability. Dedicated team membership is a prerequisite for the stable velocity that makes planning reliable.

## Work-in-Progress and Flow

- **The organization places a higher value on finished work than it does on the number of work items in process.** This principle, central to Lean and Kanban thinking, recognizes that partially completed work delivers zero value. Limiting work in progress accelerates throughput and exposes bottlenecks.

Teams that internalize this principle tend to adopt explicit WIP limits, visualize their workflow, and celebrate completion over busyness. The cultural shift from "look how much we started" to "look how much we finished" is one of the most reliable indicators of agile maturity.

Teams exploring this checklist will benefit from studying the **Agile Manifesto** and its twelve principles, which provide the philosophical foundation for every item listed here. **Scrum** and **Kanban** offer concrete frameworks for implementing these practices. **Retrospectives** are the primary mechanism for a team to assess itself against a checklist like this one and identify improvements. **Psychological safety**, as researched by Amy Edmondson and validated by Google's Project Aristotle, underpins the trust and experimentation items. **Lean software development** deepens the understanding of flow, WIP limits, and waste reduction. Finally, **scaling frameworks** such as SAFe, LeSS, and Nexus address how these practices extend across multiple teams and portfolios.

## Summary

The agile practices checklist is not a certification rubric or a pass/fail test. It is a mirror that reflects the degree to which an organization has internalized agile values in its daily operations. The items span decision-making speed, empirical planning, trust, communication, experimentation, quality discipline, organizational sponsorship, cross-team coordination, and flow management. Teams that score well on most items are likely delivering value consistently and adapting quickly. Teams that find significant gaps have a clear, actionable starting point for improvement. The checklist works best when revisited regularly, discussed openly in retrospectives, and treated as a living instrument rather than a one-time assessment.
