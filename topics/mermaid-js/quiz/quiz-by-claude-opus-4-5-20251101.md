  <p>It eliminates the need for server-side processing or external server dependencies</p>
  <p>Mermaid.js runs entirely in the browser, which means no server-side processing or dependencies on external servers are required. This makes it convenient for creating and sharing diagrams on websites, as diagrams render client-side without additional infrastructure.</p>
