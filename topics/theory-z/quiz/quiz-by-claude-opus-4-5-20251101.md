  <p>Combining long-term employment, collective decision-making, and employee well-being</p>
  <p>Theory Z, developed by William Ouchi in the 1980s, blends Japanese and American management practices. Its key aspects include providing stable long-term employment to build loyalty, promoting participatory decision-making to increase ownership, focusing on employee well-being and personal growth, emphasizing consensus and harmony, and prioritizing quality over short-term productivity. This holistic approach contrasts with more transactional Western management styles.</p>
