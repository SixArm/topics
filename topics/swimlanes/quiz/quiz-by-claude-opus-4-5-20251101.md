  <p>To visualize and organize responsibilities of different team members, departments, or stakeholders</p>
  <p>Swimlanes are a visual representation technique that divides a project or process into horizontal (or vertical) lanes, where each lane represents a particular group, individual, or department. This makes it clear who is responsible for each step, helps identify overlaps or gaps in responsibilities, and improves coordination and communication between team members. Swimlanes are commonly used in Kanban boards, process flowcharts, and various Agile methodologies.</p>
