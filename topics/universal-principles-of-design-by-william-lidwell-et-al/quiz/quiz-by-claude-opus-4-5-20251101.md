  <p>The time required to reach a target is based on the target's size and distance</p>
  <p>Fitts's Law is a predictive model of human movement that states the time to acquire a target depends on the distance to the target and the target's size. This principle is essential for technology professionals when designing user interfaces, as it informs optimal placement and sizing of interactive elements such as buttons, links, and menus to maximize usability and efficiency.</p>
