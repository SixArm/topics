  <p>Businesses sell goods or services directly to individual end-users</p>
  <p>B2C refers to commerce where a business sells goods or services directly to consumers who are the end-users. Unlike B2B (business-to-business), the focus is on individual customers who will personally use or consume the products, requiring businesses to build strong brand images, provide satisfying customer experiences, and comply with consumer protection regulations.</p>
