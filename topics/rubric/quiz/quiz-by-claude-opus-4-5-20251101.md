  <p>A holistic rubric provides an overall assessment, while an analytic rubric breaks down the assessment into specific components or criteria</p>
  <p>A holistic rubric evaluates work as a whole, giving a single score or rating for overall quality. An analytic rubric, in contrast, separates the assessment into distinct criteria or dimensions, allowing evaluators to score each component independently. This distinction is important for technology professionals because analytic rubrics provide more granular feedback useful for code reviews, sprint retrospectives, and performance evaluations, while holistic rubrics can be efficient for quick quality checks.</p>
