# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Tutorial

## Overview

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable metrics used to evaluate the performance of an organization, team, or individual against strategic objectives. In agile contexts, KPIs help teams measure whether their work is delivering the intended outcomes and identify areas for improvement.

## Characteristics of Good KPIs

Good KPIs follow the SMART framework:

- **Specific**: Clearly defined and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable with available data
- **Achievable**: Realistic targets based on current capabilities
- **Relevant**: Directly connected to strategic objectives
- **Time-bound**: Measured over a defined period

## Common KPI Categories

### Business KPIs
- **Revenue**: Money generated over a specific period
- **Customer acquisition cost**: Cost of acquiring a new customer
- **Customer lifetime value**: Total revenue expected from a customer over their relationship
- **Market share**: Percentage of the total market served

### Customer KPIs
- **Customer satisfaction (CSAT)**: How satisfied customers are with the product or service
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Customer loyalty and willingness to recommend
- **Churn rate**: Percentage of customers who stop using the product
- **Conversion rate**: Percentage of visitors who take a desired action

### Team and Process KPIs
- **Velocity**: Work completed per sprint
- **Cycle time**: Time from work start to completion
- **Defect rate**: Bugs found per release or per story point
- **Employee engagement**: Team morale and motivation levels

### Product KPIs
- **Feature adoption**: Percentage of users who use a specific feature
- **Time to value**: How quickly new users achieve their first meaningful outcome
- **Uptime/reliability**: System availability percentage
- **Performance metrics**: Response times, load capacity

## Using KPIs in Agile Teams

### Connecting KPIs to Product Goals

Product-level KPIs should inform what the team builds. If a KPI indicates declining customer satisfaction, the team should investigate and prioritize improvements. If a KPI shows strong feature adoption, the team should continue investing in that area.

### Sprint-Level KPI Tracking

While most KPIs are tracked over longer periods (monthly, quarterly), teams should review relevant KPIs during sprint planning and sprint reviews to maintain connection between daily work and strategic outcomes.

### Using KPIs for Prioritization

When choosing between backlog items, consider which ones are most likely to move important KPIs. This prevents the team from building features that are interesting but do not contribute to organizational goals.

## Setting Up KPIs

### Step 1: Identify Strategic Objectives

KPIs derive from objectives. Before choosing KPIs, be clear about what the organization or team is trying to achieve.

### Step 2: Select a Small Number of KPIs

Three to seven KPIs are usually sufficient. Too many KPIs dilute focus and create measurement overhead.

### Step 3: Define Measurement Methods

For each KPI, specify:
- What data is needed
- Where the data comes from
- How frequently it is measured
- Who is responsible for tracking it

### Step 4: Set Targets

Establish baseline measurements and set improvement targets. Targets should be challenging but achievable.

### Step 5: Review and Adjust

KPIs should be reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant. As organizational priorities shift, KPIs should evolve to match.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Vanity metrics**: Metrics that look impressive but do not indicate meaningful progress (e.g., total page views without context)
- **Gaming**: When KPIs are tied to incentives, people may optimize for the metric rather than the underlying goal
- **Too many KPIs**: Tracking everything means focusing on nothing
- **Lagging indicators only**: Balance lagging indicators (results) with leading indicators (predictors of future results)
- **Set and forget**: KPIs that are never reviewed or acted upon add no value

## Complementing KPIs with Other Measures

KPIs provide quantitative insight but should be supplemented with:

- **Qualitative feedback**: User interviews, support conversations, and team discussions
- **Expert judgment**: Experienced practitioners can identify issues that metrics miss
- **Leading indicators**: Metrics that predict future outcomes, not just measure past results

## Key Takeaway

KPIs translate strategic objectives into measurable targets that guide decision-making. In agile teams, they connect sprint-level work to organizational outcomes, inform prioritization, and provide evidence of whether the team's efforts are having the intended impact. Choose KPIs carefully, keep the set small, review them regularly, and always use them alongside qualitative insight.
