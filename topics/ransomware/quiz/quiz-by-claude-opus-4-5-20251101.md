  <p>Regularly backing up data to secure, isolated locations</p>
  <p>Regular data backups are the most critical defense against ransomware because even if systems are compromised and data is encrypted, organizations can restore their data from backups without paying the ransom. This approach eliminates the attacker's leverage entirely. Paying ransoms is discouraged because there is no guarantee attackers will provide working decryption keys, and it funds further criminal activity. Robust backups, combined with keeping software up-to-date and using anti-virus software and firewalls, form the foundation of ransomware prevention and recovery.</p>
