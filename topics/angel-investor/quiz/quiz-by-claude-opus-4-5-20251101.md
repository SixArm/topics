  <p>Angel investors provide capital to early-stage startups in exchange for equity ownership. Unlike lenders who receive interest payments, angel investors become partial owners of the company. They may also receive additional rights and privileges, such as a seat on the board of directors or the ability to veto certain decisions. This equity-based model means angel investing is high-risk, high-reward—investors profit only if the startup succeeds and increases in value.</p>
