## Angel Investor: A Comprehensive Tutorial for Technology Professionals

### What Is an Angel Investor?

An angel investor is a high-net-worth individual who provides capital to early-stage startups in exchange for equity ownership. Unlike institutional investors, angels invest their personal funds and often bring industry expertise, mentorship, and valuable networks to the companies they back.

The term "angel" originated from Broadway theater, where wealthy individuals would finance theatrical productions. Today, angel investors serve as a critical bridge between friends-and-family funding and institutional venture capital.

**Domain Experts**: Former executives or founders who invest specifically in industries where they have deep expertise and can add strategic value.

**Strategic Angels**: Individuals whose companies could become customers, partners, or acquirers of the startups they fund.

### The Angel Investment Process

1. **Deal sourcing**: Angels find opportunities through personal networks, accelerators, pitch events, and online platforms
2. **Initial screening**: Quick assessment of team, market, and product fit
3. **Due diligence**: Review of financials, legal structure, cap table, and competitive landscape
4. **Term negotiation**: Discussion of valuation, investment amount, and deal terms
5. **Documentation**: Execution of SAFE, convertible note, or equity documents
6. **Funding**: Wire transfer of investment capital
7. **Post-investment**: Ongoing support, follow-on decisions, and portfolio management

### Common Investment Instruments

| Instrument | Description | Pros | Cons |
|------------|-------------|------|------|
| SAFE | Simple Agreement for Future Equity | Simple, fast, founder-friendly | No maturity date, valuation uncertainty |
| Convertible Note | Debt that converts to equity | Established legal framework, interest accrues | Maturity date creates pressure |
| Priced Equity | Direct purchase of shares | Clear ownership, immediate valuation | Complex, expensive, time-consuming |

### What Angels Look For in Startups

- **Exceptional founders**: Strong technical skills, domain expertise, and demonstrated resilience
- **Large addressable market**: Minimum $1B+ market opportunity

- **Defensibility**: Proprietary technology, network effects, or unique data advantages
- **Clear path to returns**: Viable exit scenarios through acquisition or IPO
- **Reasonable valuation**: Terms that allow meaningful returns even in moderate outcomes

### Finding and Approaching Angel Investors

**Direct outreach channels**:

### Risks and Considerations

**For startups**:
- Dilution of founder ownership
- Potential for misaligned expectations
- Difficulty managing multiple small investors
- Risk of investors who become disengaged or difficult

**For angels**:
- High failure rate (50–70% of angel investments return nothing)
- Illiquidity (5–10 year holding periods common)
- Information asymmetry with founders
- Limited governance rights compared to VCs

### Key Terms to Understand

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|

| Post-money valuation | Company value after new investment |

### The Angel Ecosystem's Role in Tech

Angel investors fill a critical funding gap in the startup ecosystem. When a company is too early for venture capital but needs more capital than friends and family can provide, angels step in. They take outsized risks on unproven teams and nascent markets, enabling innovation that institutional investors cannot support.

For technology professionals considering angel investing, the activity offers potential financial returns, intellectual engagement with emerging technologies, and opportunities to shape the next generation of companies. For founders, angels represent accessible capital paired with experienced guidance during the most vulnerable phase of company building.

The relationship between angel and founder, when well-matched, creates value far beyond the initial check—providing strategic support, industry credibility, and a foundation for future fundraising success.
