  <p>The acquiring company makes a bid without the support of the target company's management</p>
  <p>In a hostile transaction, the acquiring company attempts to purchase the target company without the cooperation or approval of the target's management team. This contrasts with friendly transactions where both companies negotiate terms and work toward a mutually beneficial outcome. Understanding this distinction is important for technology professionals involved in M&A deals, as it affects negotiation strategies, due diligence processes, and stakeholder management throughout the transaction.</p>
