  <p>Risks are distributed to the party best equipped to manage them</p>
  <p>In PPPs, risk sharing is a fundamental principle where risks such as construction delays, cost overruns, or revenue fluctuations are allocated to whichever party—public or private—has the expertise and capability to manage them most effectively. This strategic allocation maximizes efficiency and project success rather than arbitrary or one-sided distribution.</p>
