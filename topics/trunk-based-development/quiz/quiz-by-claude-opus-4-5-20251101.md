# Trunk-based development

Question: What is the primary requirement of trunk-based development (TBD) regarding the main codebase?

- [ ] Developers must maintain separate long-lived feature branches for each release
- [ ] The trunk should only be updated during scheduled deployment windows
- [ ] The trunk must always remain in a deployable state
- [ ] Code reviews must be completed within 24 hours of submission

  <p>The trunk must always remain in a deployable state</p>
  <p>Trunk-based development emphasizes continuous integration and delivery by keeping a single codebase (the trunk or mainline) that is always in a deployable state. This foundational principle enables faster feedback and testing, better code quality through early issue detection, and faster time to market. Developers commit changes frequently and keep their code small and focused to maintain this deployable state.</p>
