  <p>The model correctly predicts the negative class</p>
  <p>A true negative occurs when the model correctly predicts the negative class. For example, predicting that a person does not have a tumor, and in reality, the person does not have it. The prediction was negative and correct. This is the opposite of a false negative, where the model incorrectly predicts negative when the actual class is positive.</p>
