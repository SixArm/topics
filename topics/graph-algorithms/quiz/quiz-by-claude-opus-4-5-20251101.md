# Graph algorithms

Question: Which algorithm would you use to find the shortest path between two specific nodes in a weighted graph?

- [ ] Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- [ ] Kruskal's Algorithm
- [ ] Dijkstra's Algorithm
- [ ] Depth-First Search (DFS)

  <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm</p>
  <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm is specifically designed to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. It works by assigning tentative distances to each node and progressively updating them as it explores the graph. BFS and DFS are traversal algorithms that don't account for edge weights, while Kruskal's Algorithm finds a minimum spanning tree rather than a shortest path.</p>
