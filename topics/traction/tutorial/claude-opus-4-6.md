# Traction

Traction is the measurable evidence that a company, particularly a startup, is gaining momentum in its market. It encompasses customer adoption, revenue growth, user engagement, and other key performance indicators that collectively demonstrate a business is viable, scalable, and moving in the right direction. For technology professionals, understanding traction is essential whether you are building a product, evaluating a venture, or communicating progress to stakeholders and investors.

## Why Traction Matters

Traction is the single most persuasive signal a startup can send to the outside world. Investors, partners, and prospective employees all look at traction as a proxy for product-market fit and long-term potential. A company with strong traction can negotiate better funding terms, attract top talent, and secure strategic partnerships. Without it, even the most elegant technology or compelling pitch deck will struggle to convert interest into commitment.

Traction also serves as an internal compass. It tells a team whether its hypotheses about the market are correct, whether its go-to-market strategy is working, and where to double down or pivot. Teams that track traction rigorously make better decisions, faster.

## Common Traction Metrics

The metrics that define traction vary by business model, stage, and industry. The table below outlines the most widely used indicators across different company types.

| Metric | Description | Best Suited For |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly Active Users (MAU) | Unique users engaging with the product each month | Consumer apps, platforms |
| Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) | Predictable subscription revenue collected each month | SaaS, subscription businesses |
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | Average cost to acquire a single new customer | All business models |
| Lifetime Value (LTV) | Total revenue expected from a customer over the relationship | SaaS, e-commerce, marketplaces |
| Churn Rate | Percentage of customers lost over a given period | Subscription and recurring models |
| Net Promoter Score (NPS) | Measure of customer satisfaction and likelihood to recommend | All business models |
| Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) | Total value of goods sold through a marketplace | Marketplaces, e-commerce |
| Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU) | Ratio indicating engagement stickiness | Consumer apps, social platforms |
| Revenue Growth Rate | Month-over-month or year-over-year revenue increase | All revenue-generating businesses |
| Retention Rate | Percentage of customers who continue using the product over time | All business models |

## Traction Channels

Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares, in their book *Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth*, identify 19 channels through which startups can acquire customers. Technology professionals should understand these channels and systematically test them rather than defaulting to the most familiar ones.

- **Viral marketing** — designing the product so existing users naturally invite new users
- **Search engine optimization (SEO)** — optimizing content and site structure to rank in organic search
- **Content marketing** — publishing valuable material that attracts and educates a target audience
- **Email marketing** — building and nurturing a subscriber list to drive engagement and conversion
- **Paid advertising** — using search ads, display ads, or social media ads to reach prospects
- **Engineering as marketing** — building free tools, calculators, or APIs that attract users
- **Business development** — forming strategic partnerships that open new distribution paths
- **Sales** — direct outreach to prospects through inside or field sales teams
- **Community building** — cultivating a group of engaged users who advocate for the product
- **Public relations** — earning media coverage to raise awareness and credibility
- **Existing platforms** — leveraging app stores, browser extensions, or integrations within established ecosystems

The recommended approach is the Bullseye Framework: brainstorm all channels, rank them by expected impact, test the top three cheaply, and then focus resources on the one that delivers the best results.

## Stages of Traction

Traction expectations shift dramatically as a company matures. What counts as impressive at the seed stage would be unremarkable for a Series B company.

| Stage | Typical Traction Evidence | Investor Expectation |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-seed | Problem validation, early user interviews, waitlist signups | Evidence that a real problem exists for a defined audience |
| Seed | Working prototype, first paying customers, early retention data | Product-market fit signals and a credible growth hypothesis |
| Series A | Consistent MRR growth, repeatable acquisition channels, strong retention | Proven unit economics and a clear path to scaling |
| Series B and beyond | Significant revenue, market share gains, expansion into new segments | Demonstrated ability to scale operations and sustain growth |

## Measuring Traction Effectively

Tracking vanity metrics such as total signups or page views can create a false sense of progress. Effective traction measurement requires discipline around a few principles:

- **Focus on actionable metrics.** Choose metrics that directly inform decisions. If a metric goes up or down, you should know exactly what to do about it.
- **Track cohorts, not aggregates.** Analyze user behavior by the week or month they joined. Cohort analysis reveals whether the product is genuinely improving over time.
- **Establish a North Star metric.** Identify the single metric that best captures the core value your product delivers. For Slack, it was messages sent; for Airbnb, nights booked.
- **Set leading indicators.** Revenue is a lagging indicator. Identify upstream signals such as activation rate, feature adoption, or referral invitations that predict future revenue.
- **Review regularly.** Weekly traction reviews keep the team honest and enable rapid course correction.

## Building Traction as a Technology Professional

Technology professionals play a direct role in generating traction, not just measuring it. Product engineers influence activation rates through onboarding flows. Infrastructure engineers affect retention through reliability and performance. Data engineers enable the analytics pipelines that make traction visible in the first place.

Practical steps include:

- **Instrument everything.** Ensure key user actions are tracked from day one so the team can measure what matters.
- **Reduce friction.** Every unnecessary step in a signup flow, every slow page load, and every confusing UI element erodes traction. Treat these as engineering problems with business impact.
- **Enable experimentation.** Build feature flagging and A/B testing infrastructure so the team can iterate quickly on acquisition and retention tactics.
- **Collaborate cross-functionally.** Traction is not solely a marketing or sales concern. Sit in on growth meetings, understand the funnel, and align technical work with traction goals.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Optimizing for the wrong metric.** Growing signups while ignoring activation and retention leads to a leaky bucket.
- **Premature scaling.** Pouring resources into growth before achieving product-market fit wastes capital and can accelerate failure.
- **Channel dependency.** Relying on a single acquisition channel creates fragility. Algorithm changes, policy shifts, or cost increases can eliminate traction overnight.
- **Ignoring churn.** Acquiring new customers while losing existing ones at a comparable rate produces the illusion of growth without real progress.
- **Confusing activity with traction.** Shipping features, attending conferences, and hiring aggressively feel productive but do not constitute traction unless they move core metrics.

## Summary

Traction is the quantifiable proof that a business is gaining real momentum in its market. It is measured through metrics such as revenue growth, user engagement, retention, and customer acquisition efficiency, and it varies in form depending on business model and stage. For technology professionals, traction is not an abstract business concept but a direct output of the products, systems, and experiences they build. By instrumenting products carefully, reducing user friction, enabling rapid experimentation, and aligning technical decisions with growth objectives, engineers and technical leaders can be among the most powerful drivers of traction in any organization.
