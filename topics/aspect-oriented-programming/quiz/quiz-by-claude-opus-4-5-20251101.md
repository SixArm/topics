# Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

Question: What is the primary problem that Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) solves?

- [ ] Improving application performance by optimizing memory allocation
- [ ] Enabling real-time data synchronization between distributed systems
- [ ] Modularizing crosscutting concerns that are scattered across multiple modules in traditional OOP
- [ ] Replacing object-oriented programming with a functional programming approach

  <p>Modularizing crosscutting concerns that are scattered across multiple modules in traditional OOP</p>
  <p>AOP addresses the challenge of crosscutting concerns—functionalities like logging, security, and transaction management—that cut across different modules of an application. In traditional object-oriented programming, these concerns become scattered across many modules, making code difficult to maintain, test, and understand. AOP solves this by isolating crosscutting concerns into separate modules called aspects, which can be applied to different components without modifying their original code.</p>
