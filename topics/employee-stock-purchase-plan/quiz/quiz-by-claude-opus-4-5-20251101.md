  <p>10-15% off the market price</p>
  <p>ESPPs typically offer employees a discount of 10-15% off the current market price of the company's stock. This discount, combined with favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, makes ESPPs an attractive benefit for employees to participate in the financial success of their company.</p>
