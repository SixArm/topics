  <p>Traditional customer interviews fail because they use leading questions that elicit positive but unhelpful feedback</p>
  <p>The Mom Test methodology addresses the fundamental problem that entrepreneurs tend to ask leading questions that make customers feel good about their product or idea, rather than uncovering harsh realities. The book provides a framework for asking open-ended questions, avoiding leading questions, and actively listening to get honest, actionable feedback that can genuinely improve products and business decisions.</p>
