## The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick

"The Mom Test" is a practical guide to customer discovery that helps entrepreneurs, product managers, and technology professionals extract honest, actionable feedback from potential customers. The book's core insight is deceptively simple: most customer conversations fail not because customers lie, but because we ask the wrong questions.

## The Core Problem with Customer Interviews

Traditional customer interviews suffer from a fundamental flaw: people want to be polite. When you pitch your idea and ask "Would you use this?" or "Do you think this is a good idea?", you're essentially asking for validation. Friends, family, and even strangers will typically tell you what you want to hear rather than crushing your dreams.

This creates a dangerous feedback loop where entrepreneurs build products based on false positives—enthusiastic responses that never translate to actual purchases or usage.

## What Is The Mom Test?

The Mom Test is named after the idea that even your mother—who loves you unconditionally and wants you to succeed—cannot lie to you if you ask the right questions. The methodology centers on three rules:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Talk about their life, not your idea | Ask about specific past behaviors and problems, not hypothetical future actions |
| Ask about specifics in the past | Concrete examples reveal truth; abstract opinions hide it |
| Talk less and listen more | You're there to learn, not to pitch or convince |

## Key Principles

**Avoid compliments and opinions.** Statements like "That sounds great!" or "I would definitely use that" are worthless data. Compliments are not commitments.

**Seek specific behaviors.** Instead of asking "Would you pay for this?", ask "How are you solving this problem today?" and "What have you tried?" Past behavior predicts future behavior far better than stated intentions.

**Dig into the pain.** When someone mentions a problem, explore how much it actually matters. Have they actively searched for solutions? Have they spent money? Have they built workarounds? The absence of these signals suggests the problem isn't painful enough to solve.

## Good Questions vs. Bad Questions

| Bad Question | Why It Fails | Better Alternative |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Do you think this is a good idea?" | Invites validation | "Tell me about the last time you faced this problem" |
| "Would you buy this?" | Hypothetical; easy to say yes | "How much are you currently spending to solve this?" |
| "How much would you pay?" | People overestimate willingness | "What's your budget for tools like this?" |
| "Do you have this problem?" | Leading question | "Walk me through your workflow for X" |

## Commitment and Advancement

One of the book's most practical insights is the concept of commitment and advancement. A successful customer conversation ends with the other person giving something up—their time, their reputation, or their money.

**Signs of genuine interest:**
- They agree to a follow-up meeting with specific dates
- They introduce you to colleagues or decision-makers
- They share internal documents or processes
- They agree to a pilot or trial
- They pre-order or put down a deposit

**Signs of fake interest:**
- Generic compliments
- "Keep me posted"
- "Sounds interesting"
- Vague promises to connect later

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Fishing for compliments** by framing questions around your solution rather than their problem
- **Talking too much** and turning an interview into a pitch
- **Accepting fluff** like "I think people would love this" without drilling into specifics
- **Avoiding bad news** by steering away from uncomfortable truths
- **Not taking notes** and losing valuable details
- **Interviewing in groups** where social dynamics distort individual opinions

## Applying The Mom Test in Practice

**Before the conversation:**
- Prepare three key learning objectives
- Identify the riskiest assumptions in your business model
- Frame questions around those assumptions

**During the conversation:**
- Start with context about them, not you
- Listen for emotional signals—frustration, excitement, resignation
- Follow unexpected threads; gold often hides in tangents
- Push past the first answer with "Tell me more about that"

**After the conversation:**
- Review notes immediately while memory is fresh
- Extract concrete facts, not interpretations
- Update your assumptions based on evidence
- Decide what to do differently in the next conversation

## When to Use The Mom Test

| Situation | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Pre-product discovery | Validate that the problem exists and matters |
| Feature prioritization | Determine which capabilities drive real value |
| Pivoting decisions | Test new directions before committing resources |
| Sales conversations | Qualify leads and understand buying criteria |
| Customer success | Uncover unmet needs and churn risks |

## Key Takeaways

The Mom Test transforms customer conversations from validation theater into genuine learning. The methodology works because it shifts focus from opinions about the future to facts about the past. By understanding how people currently behave, what they've tried, and where they've spent resources, you build products based on reality rather than wishful thinking.

For technology professionals, this framework is invaluable at every stage—from initial concept validation through scaling a mature product. The questions you ask determine the quality of data you receive, and The Mom Test provides a reliable system for asking questions that produce truth.
