  <p>Create a minimum viable product (MVP) to get feedback from customers</p>
  <p>Starting small with an MVP allows entrepreneurs to test their ideas with real customers, gather feedback, and refine their product or service based on actual data before investing significant resources. This lean approach reduces risk and helps validate whether the idea meets genuine customer needs.</p>
