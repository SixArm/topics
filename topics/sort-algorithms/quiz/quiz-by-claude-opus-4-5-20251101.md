# Sort algorithms

Question: Which sorting algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach by partitioning an unsorted list around a pivot element and recursively sorting the resulting sub-lists?

  <p>Quick Sort</p>
  <p>Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the list so elements smaller than the pivot come before it and elements larger come after it, then recursively sorting the two resulting sub-lists. It is widely used in practice due to its average-case O(n log n) time complexity and efficient in-place sorting capability.</p>
