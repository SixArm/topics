# Earned income

Earned income refers to compensation received in exchange for labor, services, or active participation in work. For technology professionals, earned income encompasses salaries from full-time employment, hourly wages from contract work, freelance project fees, consulting revenue, stock compensation tied to employment, and performance bonuses. Unlike passive income from investments or rental properties, earned income requires direct, ongoing effort. Understanding earned income is essential for career planning, tax strategy, negotiation, and long-term wealth building.

## Types of Earned Income

Earned income takes several forms, each with distinct characteristics relevant to technology professionals.

| Type | Description | Common In Tech |
|---|---|---|
| Salary | Fixed annual compensation paid on a regular schedule | Full-time roles at companies of all sizes |
| Hourly wages | Pay calculated by hours worked, often with overtime eligibility | Contract and agency positions |
| Commissions | Percentage-based pay tied to sales or revenue generated | Sales engineering, business development |
| Bonuses | One-time or periodic payments for performance or milestones | Annual reviews, project completions |
| Tips | Gratuities from clients or customers | Rare in technology |
| Freelance/contract income | Project-based or time-based compensation from independent work | Consulting, independent development |
| Self-employment income | Revenue from operating a business or practice | Startup founders, independent consultants |

## Earned Income vs. Other Income Types

It is important to distinguish earned income from other categories of income, because each is treated differently for tax purposes, retirement planning, and financial strategy.

- **Earned income** is generated by active work and labor. It is subject to payroll taxes including Social Security and Medicare, and income tax is typically withheld by employers. Self-employed individuals pay self-employment tax to cover both the employer and employee portions.

- **Investment income** comes from capital gains, dividends, and interest on financial assets. It is generally taxed at different rates, often lower long-term capital gains rates, and is not subject to payroll taxes.

- **Passive income** is derived from rental properties, limited partnerships, or business activities in which the earner does not materially participate. It has its own set of tax rules and limitations on deducting losses.

For technology professionals, the lines can blur. Equity compensation such as stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) may be classified as earned income when they vest or are exercised, even though they resemble investment assets. Understanding these distinctions is critical for tax planning.

## Factors That Affect Earned Income

Several factors determine the level of earned income a technology professional can command:

- **Education and credentials**: Degrees in computer science, engineering, or related fields, along with industry certifications, tend to correlate with higher starting salaries and faster career progression.

- **Experience and tenure**: Years of relevant experience remain one of the strongest predictors of compensation. Senior engineers, architects, and technical leads earn substantially more than entry-level counterparts.

- **Specialized skills**: Proficiency in high-demand areas such as machine learning, cloud architecture, cybersecurity, or data engineering commands premium compensation due to supply-demand imbalances.

- **Geographic location**: Salaries vary significantly by region. Technology hubs such as San Francisco, New York, and Seattle offer higher nominal compensation, though cost of living offsets some of the difference. Remote work has begun to compress but not eliminate these differentials.

- **Industry sector**: Financial services, healthcare technology, and defense contracting often pay higher than average for comparable roles, reflecting regulatory complexity and domain expertise requirements.

- **Company stage and size**: Large established companies tend to offer higher base salaries and benefits, while startups may offer lower base pay with equity upside.

## Taxation of Earned Income

Earned income is subject to multiple layers of taxation that technology professionals should understand.

| Tax Type | Applies To | Key Details |
|---|---|---|
| Federal income tax | All earned income | Progressive rates; withheld by employer for W-2 workers |
| State income tax | Earned income in most states | Rates vary; some states (e.g., Texas, Florida, Washington) have no state income tax |
| Social Security tax | Earned income up to annual cap | 6.2% employee share; 12.4% for self-employed |
| Medicare tax | All earned income | 1.45% employee share; 2.9% for self-employed; additional 0.9% above high-income thresholds |
| Self-employment tax | Freelance and business income | Covers both employer and employee portions of Social Security and Medicare |

W-2 employees have taxes withheld automatically by their employers. Independent contractors and freelancers receive 1099 forms and must estimate and pay taxes quarterly. Failing to plan for self-employment taxes is one of the most common financial mistakes technology professionals make when transitioning to freelance or consulting work.

## Strategies to Increase Earned Income

Technology professionals have several levers for increasing their earned income over time:

- **Skill acquisition**: Learning emerging technologies, earning relevant certifications, and building depth in high-demand specializations directly increases market value.

- **Career advancement**: Pursuing promotions into senior individual contributor or management tracks within an organization typically yields significant salary increases at each level.

- **Job mobility**: Changing employers strategically remains one of the fastest ways to increase compensation, as external offers often exceed internal raise budgets.

- **Negotiation**: Negotiating offers, raises, and contract rates is a high-leverage activity. Researching market rates, quantifying impact, and practicing negotiation skills can yield substantial returns.

- **Diversifying income streams**: Combining a primary salary with consulting, technical writing, teaching, or advisory work creates multiple channels of earned income.

- **Self-employment and entrepreneurship**: Starting a consulting practice, software product, or technology services company can remove the ceiling on earned income, though it introduces additional risk and operational responsibility.

## Earned Income and Retirement Planning

Earned income plays a central role in retirement planning because many tax-advantaged retirement accounts have contribution limits tied to earned income. For example, contributions to 401(k) plans, traditional and Roth IRAs, and SEP-IRAs all require the contributor to have earned income. Technology professionals with high earned income should maximize contributions to employer-sponsored plans, especially when employer matching is available, and consider additional vehicles such as backdoor Roth IRA conversions and mega backdoor Roth strategies where eligible.

## Stability and Risk

Earned income is not guaranteed. Technology professionals face risks including layoffs during economic downturns, industry shifts that devalue specific skill sets, and organizational restructuring. Contract and freelance workers face additional volatility from gaps between engagements and client concentration risk. Building an emergency fund, maintaining a current professional network, and continuously developing marketable skills are practical defenses against earned income disruption.

## Summary

Earned income is the foundation of financial life for most technology professionals, encompassing salaries, wages, bonuses, freelance revenue, and self-employment profits. It is distinguished from investment and passive income by its requirement for active labor, and it carries specific tax obligations including payroll taxes that other income types do not. Factors such as skills, experience, location, and industry determine earning potential, while deliberate strategies around negotiation, career mobility, skill development, and diversification can meaningfully increase it over time. Understanding the mechanics of earned income, from taxation to retirement planning implications, equips technology professionals to make informed decisions about their careers and financial futures.
