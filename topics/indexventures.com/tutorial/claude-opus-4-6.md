# Index Ventures

Index Ventures is a prominent venture capital firm founded in 1996 in Geneva, Switzerland. Now headquartered in London with offices in San Francisco and Geneva, the firm invests in technology-driven companies across all stages of development, from seed-stage startups to high-growth enterprises. Index Ventures has built a reputation for identifying and supporting category-defining companies across enterprise software, consumer technology, fintech, healthcare, and biotech, making it one of the most influential investment firms in the global technology landscape.

## History and Background

Index Ventures was established in 1996 by Neil Rimer, Giuseppe Zocco, and David Rimer. The firm launched during the early stages of the internet revolution and quickly positioned itself as a European venture capital leader with global ambitions. Over nearly three decades, Index Ventures has evolved from a Geneva-based fund into a transatlantic powerhouse, managing billions of dollars in assets and backing companies from inception through public offering and beyond. The firm's longevity and consistent track record across multiple technology cycles distinguish it from many competitors that emerged during narrower market windows.

## Investment Strategy

Index Ventures invests across the full lifecycle of technology companies, from pre-seed and seed rounds through Series A, B, and growth-stage financing. The firm targets companies with strong and experienced management teams, scalable business models, and access to large market opportunities. Rather than concentrating on a single vertical, Index Ventures maintains a diversified portfolio strategy that spans multiple technology sectors.

|---|---|
| Enterprise Software | Cloud infrastructure, SaaS platforms, developer tools, and B2B productivity |
| Consumer Technology | Marketplaces, social platforms, gaming, and direct-to-consumer brands |

## Geographic Reach and Market Position

Index Ventures operates as a truly transatlantic firm, which gives it distinct advantages in sourcing deals and supporting companies across multiple markets.

|---|---|
| London, UK | Global headquarters; hub for European deal flow and portfolio management |
